Dynegy, the long-suffering power company, announced on Wednesday that it had settled claims with creditors holding more than $2.5 billion in claims related to the bankruptcy of one of its subsidiaries. The settlement will allow the subsidiary, Dynegy Holdings, to proceed with its bankruptcy process. Dynegy had been accused by a bankruptcy examiner of a “fraudulent” transfer of valuable assets â a set of coal-firing power plants âÂ from the subsidiary to the parent company. Under the terms of the settlement, which still has to be approved by creditors and a bankruptcy court, creditors in Dynegy Holdings will get 99 percent of the stock in the reorganized company once it emerges from bankruptcy. Shareholders will get the remaning 1 percent, with five-year warrants to buy 13.5 percent of the common stock. Robert C. Flexon, Dynegy’s chief executive, said in a statement that the settlement would put all of the bankruptcy examiner’s concerns to rest. “We are pleased that the parties have taken a pragmatic approach and have the company back on track to put the DH Chapter 11 case behind it during the third quarter of 2012,â Mr. Flexon said. Dynegy shareholders, who were poised to benefit from the asset transfer, suffered on the news of the settlement. Shares in the company were down 23 percent as of midday Wednesday. Advertisement
