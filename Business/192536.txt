Updated, 5:12 a.m. |  FRANKFURT â Deutsche Bank, Europeâs largest investment bank, said on Tuesday that net profit fell by half in the second quarter as it earned fewer fees from financial market trading and absorbed costs related to lawsuits. Responding to criticism that it is overly dependent on borrowed money, the bank also announced plans to shrink its total financial holdings to reduce risk and address demands by regulators that lenders increase their ability to absorb losses. The results showed that Deutsche Bank, like many of its peers, was still hampered by the aftereffects of the financial crisis as well as continued turmoil in securities market. In addition, banks face growing momentum for rules that would curtail their use of leverage, or borrowed money. âThe current quarter performance was significantly impacted by an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop which resulted in elevated market volatility and a broad sell-off across asset classes toward the end of the quarter,â Deutsche Bank said in a statement. Much of the turmoil was the result of investor fears about a slowdown in China and nervousness about how quickly the United States Federal Reserve will withdraw its economic stimulus measures, Stefan Krause, Deutsche Bankâs chief financial officer, told analysts during a conference call. Net profit fell to 335 million euros ($444 million) from 666 million in the second quarter of 2012, Deutsche Bank said. Revenue rose 2 percent in the quarter, but the gain was offset by additional expenses, including the cost of legal proceedings. The bank faces numerous lawsuits, including some from aggrieved investors who bought investments related to the American real estate market before the subprime crisis in 2008. Deutsche Bank said on Tuesday that it had increased the money set aside for litigation expenses by 630 million euros, bringing the total to about 3 billion euros. Deutsche Bank said it would shrink the size of its assets, the sum of its financial holdings, by 16 percent, or 250 billion euros, by the end of next year. The bank has been hurt by the perception, which it disputes, that it is one of the most-leveraged big lenders in the world. Reducing total assets is one way for the bank to address the criticism.   Leverage, the use of borrowed money to make investments, was the main theme during a conference call between Deutsche Bank’s top management and analysts on Tuesday morning. âRegulators, politicians and analysts have shifted their attention to leverage in the last few months,â Mr. Krause acknowledged. Deutsche Bank said it had increased its so-called Core Tier 1 capital ratio, one measure of a bankâs ability to absorb losses, to 10 percent at the end of June from 8.8 percent at the end of March, based on the latest regulatory standards. The bank said its leverage ratio, the proportion of its own cash or shares to borrowed money, was 3 percent. Many economists consider the leverage ratio to be a better measure of a bankâs resiliency than the capital ratio; regulators in the United States are in the process of raising the required leverage ratio for the largest banks to 6 percent. The ratio, however, depends partly on how banks value their assets. Under some of the latest proposals from regulators, which would restrict banksâ ability to use accounting rules to reduce reported assets, Deutsche Bankâs leverage ratio would be under 3 percent, Mr. Krause indicated in response to analyst questions. In a statement, Anshu Jain and JÃ¼rgen Fitschen, co-chief executives of the bank, said they were âcommitted to further reducing the balance sheet in a manner that enables us to meet requirements on leverage ratio, sustain our value proposition to clients and strengthen our business model without materially impacting financial performance.â  Advertisement
