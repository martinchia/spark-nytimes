On Wall Street, there are âmerger Mondays.â Sometimes, there are mega merger Mondays. This quirk of Wall Street’s calendar — a surge of deal announcements at the beginning of the week, after companies and their advisers have spent the weekend in last-minute negotiations — was back with a vengeance this Monday, after two enormous deals were unveiled. In the oilfield services sector, Halliburton agreed to buy its smaller rival Baker Hughes for $34.6 billion; and in pharmaceuticals, Actavis agreed to pay $66 billion for Allergan, the maker of Botox. The week ranks as the largest âmerger Mondayâ of the year, with $105.1 billion of deals revealed, according to data from Thomson Reuters. And it certain ranks as one of the largest Mondays since at least 2011. Only Sept. 2, 2013 — when $133.6 billion worth of deals were announced globally — was a bigger blockbuster than this week. That was when Verizon Communications sealed a long-sought deal to take full control of its huge wireless unit, a transaction worth $130 billion. A giant deal, or two, is what tends to put a merger Monday on the map. That September in 2013 was Labor Day in the United States but a total of 141 deals were announced, according to Thomson Reuters. All but one were tiny. This fact makes the recent achievement on Monday remarkable for another reason. Most merger Mondays include more than 100 deals, but this new one has just seven so far, the data shows. (Keep in mind that the day isnât over and more deals may yet be announced.) This merger Monday was so mega, it dethroned the previous largest merger Monday of the year. That was on Jan. 13, when $90.4 billion worth of deals were made public. Among those was Charter Communicationsâ $37.8 billion offer to acquire Time Warner Cable, an attempt that failed after Comcast swooped in with a higher offer. Also that day, Suntory of Japan agreed to buy the maker of Jim Beam whiskey for $13.6 billion, and Google said it would buy Nest Labs, a maker of Internet-connected appliances, for $3.2 billion. A similarly huge merger Monday came on Aug. 11 this year. The previous evening (which counts as part of Monday for these purposes), Kinder Morgan announced a $71 billion deal to consolidate its businesses. That contributed to an $89.9 billion tally of announced deals for the day, according to the data. Depending on how you measure them, some merger Mondays could easily go unnoticed. On Nov. 12, 2012, the most significant deal on Wall Street was the Leucadia National Corporationâs acquisition of the investment bank Jefferies Group, for $3.6 billion. The total value of deals that day was just $25.3 billion. But the day in 2012 was full of under-the-radar transactions. A total of 556 were announced, the data shows, making it the busiest merger Monday in terms of the number of deals since at least 2011. Advertisement
