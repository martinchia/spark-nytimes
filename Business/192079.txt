Sara Lee announced on Wednesday that it had reached an agreement to sell its White King and Janola cleaning brands to Symex Holdings of Australia for about $50 million.  It may be a small deal, but it is part of a larger effort Sara Lee to narrow its focus to just selling food.  In early December, Sara Lee closed the $2.5 billion sale of its body care business to Unilever. Procter & Gamble bought its Ambi Pur air freshener brand for $420 million. Collectively, such deals are expected to generate pretax proceeds of almost $2.5 billion, the company said in a statement. These efforts come as speculation about a possible sale continues to dog the company.  DealBook reported earlier in December that Sara Lee’s talks about a potential sale to JBS of Brazil had hit a bump on price. The discussions had been on and off for several months, starting soon after Sara Lee’s chief, Brenda C. Barnes, resigned in August, citing health reasons. Advertisement
