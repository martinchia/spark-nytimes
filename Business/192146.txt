Hedge fund up-and-comers that want to give back â but not as much as the industry titans â will have their chance Thursday night at the fifth annual London gala for Hedge Funds Care. For years, there was only one hedge fund charity event in London: the annual Ark fund-raiser held every spring that attracted the industry’s glitterati. Spearheaded by Archie Busson, the on-again, off-again boyfriend of Uma Thurman, the Ark gala was London’s answer to New York’s famous Robin Hood fund-raiser. But in recent years another hedge fund charity â an offshoot of the American organization Hedge Funds Care â has been gaining steam. It operates affordable hedge fund affairs. Ticket prices for Hedge Funds Care are Â£750 or nearly $1,200 apiece. By comparison, a gold table of 10 at the annual Ark fund-raiser goes for Â£50,000 ($78,000). New York hedge fund manager John Paulson hosted his guests at a platinum table that cost Â£100,000 ($156,000). Of course, Hedge Funds Care doesnât collect as much Ark. This year Ark managed to pry $22.2 million from such heavyweights as Marshall Waceâs Ian Wace and GLGâs Philippe Lagrange. Last year, Hedge Funds Care pulled inÂ  $631,000. Its big fund-raiser on Thursday aims to raise Â£500,000 or almost $778,000. âI wouldnât say exactly weâre the small one,â said the founder of the British version ofÂ  Hedge Funds Care, Rob Mirsky. âWe just do different things.â Mr. Mirsky, an American who lives in London, explained thatÂ  Hedge Funds Care was a grant-making body intent on giving money to other charities focused on the treatment and prevention of child abuse. Ark, meanwhile,Â  is a full-fledged organization with its own charitable programs. The group counts television presenter and independent parliamentary candidate Esther Rantzen, and the brainchild behind the ChildLine charity, among its supporters. Hedge Funds Care is also more edgy than flashy. At Thursdayâs fund-raiser, Lord Jeffrey Archer, the thriller writer and a former member of Parliament with a colorful past, will act as auctioneer. Among the items available for bidding: a five-star holiday to Barbados for two and an autographed guitar used by a member of Status Quo, the British rock band. At one of its benefits, Ark raffled off five Fiat 500 automobiles decorated with butterfly designs by the hot British artist Damien Hirst. Advertisement
