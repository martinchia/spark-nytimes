MARKET TURMOIL TAKES ITS TOLL  |  Remember earlier this year, when companies were announcing a deal a minute, stocks were soaring and the initial public offerings market was surging? Those were the good old days. Recent volatility in the global markets has put a damper on all that enthusiasm, as a pall seems to have descended across Wall Street. Indeed, the industryâs big year of deal-making may have peaked on the morning of Sept. 19, when the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group went public with a valuation of more than $168 billion, DealBookâs David Gelles writes. Eight minutes later, the Standard & Poorâs 500-stock index hit an all-time high. How things have changed since last month. Fears about the global economy ignited waves of nervous selling on Wednesday, sending stock markets tumbling. The markets mostly stabilized on Thursday, with the S.&P. 500 recovering from an early slump to close slightly higher, at 1,862.76.  On Friday morning, European markets were broadly higher, and United States stock-index futures were pointing to a higher opening in New York. Still, in a few short days, much of the yearâs deal-making optimism has evaporated. With companiesâ valuations jumping around, many deals are expected to be delayed until the markets stabilize. The roller coaster markets are similarly disruptive for companies seeking to go public. Fear has spread to regulators as well, particularly when it comes to high-risk, high-yield bonds, Landon Thomas Jr. writes in DealBook. A growing number of global regulators are warning that positions in hard-to-trade, risky bonds being taken on by Pimco and other big asset management firms pose a broad danger to the financial system. This weekâs stock market volatility, along with low trading volumes and a spike in the yields of high-risk corporate and European bonds, amplified these concerns, as regulators and bank executives warned that these asset managers could find themselves unable to raise enough cash during a sell-off. Not everyone is feeling the ill effects from this weekâs stock market swoon. The billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen, for one, appears to be doing just fine, Matthew Goldstein writes in DealBook. His family office, Point72 Asset Management, continues to outperform many hedge funds this year, even after the firm took a bit of a stumble during the recent sell-off. Point72, which opened for business in the spring managing about $10 billion, mostly Mr. Cohenâs own money, is said to have generated a year-to-date gross profit of about $1.8 billion. The firm has generated gross trading profits of about $800 million since the summer, a figure that was even higher until a few weeks ago. 

GOLDMAN POSTS HIGHER PROFIT  |  Goldman Sachs on Thursday reported strong third-quarter results, but investors and analysts expressed concerns that the performance might not be sustainable over time, Nathaniel Popper writes in DealBook. Despite an announcement that profits were up nearly 50 percent from those in the period a year earlier, the firmâs stock closed down more than 2.5 percent on Thursday, much more than the broader market. Some analysts and investors worried that a significant portion of the profits came from moves that were not likely to be replicated. For instance, the bank sharply cut the amount of money it put aside to pay employees, leaving more room for profits. 
Goldmanâs most impressive results came from its so-called fixed-income trading desks, where bonds and derivatives are bought and sold. Revenue rose 74 percent from the quarter a year earlier. Revenue at the broader trading division climbed 32 percent. âUnlike some other banks, which have pared back their fixed-income operations, Goldman has bet that this business will return, and the third-quarter results seemed to show the wisdom of that move, as did the volatility in the bond markets over the last week,â Mr. Popper writes.
Morgan Stanley is set to report third-quarter earnings before the market opens on Friday.



JIMMY CHOO PRICES I.P.O.  |  The sluggish October for initial public offerings in Europe continued Friday as the luxury shoe company Jimmy Choo priced its offering at the bottom of its expected range, Chad Bray reports in DealBook. In early trading on Friday, shares of Jimmy Choo, a British brand, were up slightly above its offer price of 1.40 pounds, or $2.24, a share. Shares initially rose to Â£1.43 in the first hour of trading, but quickly pared back their gains. Following its listing, Jimmy Choo, which became the first stand-alone luxury footwear brand to be publicly traded, will have a market capitalization of Â£545.6 million.
Despite the flat opening, Jimmy Choo was a bit of a bright spot in what has been a dismal month for new listings in Europe. Two other European I.P.O.s were pulled in the past week because of market conditions, and several new listings in Europe this month have performed poorly. The shoemaker sold about 25.9 percent of its new holding company in the offering of 100.9 million shares, and raised about Â£141 million for its owner, JAB Luxury, a unit of the German holding company Joh. A. Benckiser. JAB Luxury will now hold a 70.2 percent stake in Jimmy Choo.

Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, gives a speech on economic opportunity at a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston conference at 8:30 a.m. in Boston.



 LIFE AFTER GALLEON  |  Five years after Raj Rajaratnam, founder of the Galleon Group, was arrested on insider trading charges, former employees of the hedge fund are still trying to rebuild their lives, Anita Raghavan reports in DealBook. Even now, many former portfolio managers and traders are still bitter about their experience and want nothing more to do with the Galleon name. Some are so worried about the negative sentiment that they have expunged mention of the once-mighty firm from their rÃ©sumÃ©s.
A few Galleon portfolio managers and traders were able to find jobs on Wall Street after Galleonâs collapse. Still, the success stories appear outnumbered by more somber tales, with few former employees finding the same kind of success they enjoyed at Galleon. Even former Galleon executives who left before the hedge fund imploded did not escape unscathed. In the end, more than 70 people have been convicted or pleaded guilty since the governmentâs crackdown on insider trading began with Galleon. Regardless of whether they were prosecuted, âanybody involved was affected by Galleon,â said one former employee.
