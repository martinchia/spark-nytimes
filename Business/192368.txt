Anyone who regularly reads news or plays games on a mobile device has encountered advertisements in apps. Hidden behind those ads are companies that instantly match advertisers with publishers by using data about the readers. One of those companies, a start-up called Smaato, is expected to announce on Tuesday that it has raised a $25 million financing round led by Singapore Press Holdings, a newspaper and magazine publisher. The new financing, which includes participation from the investment firms Aeris Capital and EDBI, is a bet that mobile devices will play an increasingly large role in consumersâ media diet. Smaato, which was founded in 2005, runs an advertising exchange that allows advertisers to buy ad space in auctions that last about 150 milliseconds. The company works only on mobile devices, with customers like The Times of India and the video game company Electronic Arts. Its rivals include the likes of Google and Facebook. Smaatoâs executives declined to disclose information about the companyâs valuation or revenue. But they said it collected a percentage fee from either the buyer or the seller of the ad, according to the level of demand. Singapore Press Holdings, whose shares are listed in Singapore, plans to use the Smaato product as it undertakes a broad shift of its content toward mobile devices, said Ragnar Kruse, the chief executive.   Smaato, which is based in San Francisco and has offices in New York, Hamburg, Singapore and Jakarta, has raised $47 million in financing to date. Advertisement
