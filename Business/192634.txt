LONDON â The Royal Bank of Scotland is exploring options for the international operations of its Coutts & Company private banking unit, including possible joint ventures or a sale, according to an internal memorandum on Monday. The potential sale of the Coutts International business comes as R.B.S., which is based in Edinburgh, reshapes its operations into a smaller, more British-focused bank with less lofty international ambitions. The bank is 81 percent owned by the British government after a bailout during the financial crisis. As part of its reshaping, R.B.S. undertook a review of its high-net-worth business in February. According to an internal memorandum viewed by DealBook, R.B.S. is looking to reduce the international footprint of its private banking business and align it with its renewed strategic focus on Britain. âWe will now work with local management teams to explore options including merging the remainder of the current Coutts International business, considering joint ventures or a sale,â the bank said in the memo.  The Financial Times reported in July that R.B.S. was considering a potential sale of the Coutts International business. The international business represents about 41 percent of the bankâs high net-worth operationâs assets and liabilities and about 35 percent of its revenue, according to the memo. Coutts falls under R.B.S.âs wealth segment, which posted operating profit of 221 million pounds, or about $370.6 million, in 2013. Coutts & Company was founded in 1692 and the Coutts family entered the business in 1755. The international arm of Coutts has locations in Switzerland, Monaco and parts of the Middle East and Asia. The Coutts business in Britain counts Queen Elizabeth II among its clients. Advertisement
