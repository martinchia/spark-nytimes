 A look back on our reporting of the past week’s highs and lows in finance. Mergers & Acquisitions ABB TO BUY ELECTRONICS MAKER The Swiss company agreed to buy Thomas & Betts, an American maker of electrical connectors, for about $3.9 billion in cash. Michael J. de lad Merced reported that “the takeover of Thomas & Betts is one of the largest friendly transactions announced this year.”  EXXON TO SELL JAPANESE ARM Exxon Mobil said that it had agreed to sell its Japanese subsidiary to TonenGeneral Sekiyu, a major refinery operator in Japan, for about $3.9 billion, Mr. de la Merced reported. The move is “part of a revamping of the oil giantâs operations in that country.” EXCHANGES TO CALL OFF MERGER Deutsche BÃ¶rse and NYSE Euronext said that they were in talks to call off their planned merger, after European antitrust regulators formally opposed the deal, Mr. de la Merced, James Kanter and Jack Ewing reported. GLENCORE AND MINER IN TALKS Glencore International, the biggest commodities trading company in the world, has approached the mining company Xstrata about a takeover. Mark Scott and David Jolly reported that the “long-anticipated deal that would create a company with a market value of about $80 billion.” Investment Banking U.S. BANKS TALLY EXPOSURE IN EUROPE United States banks are betting that their insurance is going to pay out, Peter Eavis reported. “Five large American banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, have more than $80 billion of exposure to Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece,” according to a New York Times analysis of the banksâ financial disclosures. R.B.S. AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD WEEK NEW FUND FOR OUTSPOKEN ANALYST Christopher Whalen of Tangent Capital Partners says the strongest banks are the ones without exposure to Wall Street. William Alden reports that he is setting up a fund focused on small and midsize banks. GOLDMAN SACHS AT P.R. CROSSROADS News of Goldmanâs courtship of Richard Siewert Jr., a former counselor to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner., has had Wall Street buzzing. It increased speculation that Lucas van Praag, the head of the companyâs public relations department, was being shown the door, Susanne Craig reported. The news also  “highlighted the often cozy relationship between Wall Street and government organizations like the Treasury Department.” Private Equity DEAL PROFESSOR Collateralized loan obligations, an important source of capital for many businesses, have made a modest comeback since the financial crisis. Steven M. Davidoff argues that their revival is under threat from well-intentioned regulators. “New C.L.O.âs are crucial to support the corporate loan market. Without them, banks will be hampered from originating credit since they will be unable to sell these loans off their balance sheet.” DEFENDERS EMERGE FROM SHADOWS As the political attacks on Mitt Romneyâs record at Bain Capital have intensified, many have wondered when the private equity industry would try to mount a full defense of its practices. After months of quiet complaining, some buyout defenders are punching back, Kevin Roose reported. “Hamilton E. James, the president of the Blackstone Group and one of the highest-ranking titans of the private equity industry, spoke in full-throated support of the business,” the same day Blackstone reported its fourth-quarter earnings. I.P.O./Offerings FACEBOOK GOING PUBLIC Legal/Regulatory FAIR GAME President Obama’s new mortgage task force has a fancy name, but Gretchen Morgenson is skeptical it will get tough. The Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group has much to tackle in the mortgage mess â and soon, if it wants to allay suspicions that the authorities have given powerful institutions a pass. “The S.E.C. is clearly proud of its financial crisis cases. But comparing its tally with the mountainous evidence produced in private lawsuits shows how much more work there is to be done.” GUPTA’S INSIDER TRADING TRIAL  REVOLVING DOOR “Greg D. Andres, a senior Justice Department official, is leaving the government to join the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell,” Mr. Lattman reported. DEALBOOK COLUMN  Usually, it is the banks that are fighting efforts to impose new regulations on the industry. Mr. Sorkin notes that now, it is foreign governments fighting against bank regulations in the United States.  “The rule says that United States banks â and possibly certain foreign banks that do business in America â would be restricted in trading foreign government bonds. Yet the rule, conveniently, provides an exemption for United States government securities. Every other country is out of luck.” EX-UBS TRADER PLEADS NOT GUILTY Kweku M. Adoboli has been charged with fraud and false accounting that led to a $2.3 billion trading loss at UBS last year, Julia Werdigier reported. Mr. Adoboli faces up to 10 years in prison. The judge said the trial would start Sept. 3.  MF GLOBAL INQUIRY  CREDIT SUISSE FRAUD CHARGES  S.E.C. AVOIDING TOUGH SANCTIONS FOR LARGE BANKS Even as the Securities and Exchange Commission has stepped up its investigations of Wall Street, the agency has repeatedly allowed the biggest firms to avoid punishments, Edward Wyatt reported. S.E.C. FRAUD SETTLEMENT APPROVED A federal judge in Wisconsin who challenged the S.E.C. last year over the adequacy of a proposed fraud settlement approved the deal this week without requiring substantial changes, Mr. Wyatt reported. SWISS BANK INDICTED Wegelin & Company, the 270-year-old Swiss private bank, was indicted in New York on federal charges that it had helped Americans evade taxes.  Advertisement
