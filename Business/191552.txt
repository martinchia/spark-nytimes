Updated, 12:19 p.m. |  LONDON â The parent of British Airways and the Spanish carrier Iberia said on Thursday that it had made a takeover approach for Aer Lingus, but that the proposal was rejected by the Irish airlineâs board. Shares of Aer Lingus jumped as much as 12 percent on Thursday after media reports that the International Consolidated Airlines Group, or I.A.G., had made a preliminary offer for the carrier. The companyâs stock closed up 9 percent, at 1.99 euros a share, or about $2.48, in Dublin on Thursday. Aer Lingus said it had received a âpreliminary, highly conditional and nonbindingâ approach from I.A.G. on Sunday and rejected the proposal on Tuesday. âThe board has reviewed the proposal and believes that it fundamentally undervalues Aer Lingus and its attractive prospects,â Aer Lingus said in a news release.  Any proposal to acquire the airline would require the approval of the discount carrier Ryanair, which holds a 29.8 percent stake in Aer Lingus, as well as the Irish government, which has a 25.1 percent stake. Ryanair has made three unsuccessful offers for Aer Lingus. Michael OâLeary, the chief executive of Ryanair, has said repeatedly that he was prepared to consider offers for his airlineâs stake in Aer Lingus but has claimed that none have been forthcoming.  Ryanair might be open to a negotiated deal with I.A.G. Ryanair and British Airways have coordinated in the past with regard to Aer Lingus, with Ryanair offering at one point to cede some of Aer Lingusâs Heathrow slots to British Airways in response to the concerns of competition regulators about its influence over Aer Lingus. On Thursday, I.A.G. and Aer Lingus did not indicate how much I.A.G. was willing to pay for the Irish carrier. âThere can be no certainty that any further proposal or offer will be forthcoming,â I.A.G. said in a news release. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of I.A.G., ran Aer Lingus for four years before leaving in 2005 to run British Airways. But Mr. Walsh has long played down speculation that his group might consider adding Aer Lingus to its portfolio of carriers, which includes British Airways and two Spanish carriers â Iberia, a full-service airline, and Vueling Airlines, a low-cost carrier. Yet analysts say the deal would be attractive in part because Aer Lingus holds many takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow Airport near London, which is British Airwaysâ main hub. Heathrow is one of the worldâs busiest airports, handling more than 191,000 passengers a day, the bulk of them from international flights, including more lucrative long-haul flights. The airport is operating at near capacity each day and British government leaders are debating whether to expand Heathrow or build a second runway at Gatwick Airport south of London to meet future demand. British Airways is by far the largest airline at Heathrow, accounting for 51.3 percent of all takeoffs and landings at the airport each week. It is followed by Lufthansa of Germany, which accounts for 5.6 percent of all flights at Heathrow each week, and Virgin Atlantic and Delta Air Lines, which combined account for 5.1 percent of all takeoffs and landings. Aer Lingus accounts for about 3 percent of the weekly takeoffs and landings at Heathrow. The Irish airline market, given its proximity to Britain and potential to increase British Airwaysâ traffic at its hub, also makes the deal attractive. After years of crippling losses, Aer Lingus has gradually returned to financial health after an aggressive turnaround program four years ago that involved deep cost cuts and a 20 percent reduction of its work force. Under the leadership of its chief executive, Christoph Mueller, Aer Lingus has embarked on a new expansion strategy that has focused on trans-Atlantic services that has brought the Irish carrier into increasing competition with British Airways.  Aer Lingusâs Dublin hub now handles about half of all North America-bound traffic from regional airports outside London, connecting passengers from smaller British cities like Leeds or Bristol who are flying to American and Canadian destinations. “There is definitely a North Atlantic consideration,” John Strickland, an independent strategist in London, said of the potential merger. “It would strengthen their position there, and obviously there is scope for economies of scale.” Aer Lingus operates 47 Airbus aircraft and carries over 10.6 million passengers a year. In the first nine months of 2014, it posted passenger and cargo revenue of â¬1.23 billion, up 9.3 percent from the period a year earlier. I.A.G. is one of the worldâs largest airline groups, carrying more than 67.2 million passengers a year. It posted revenue of â¬15.2 billion in the first nine months of 2014, up 7.4 percent from the period a year earlier. Chad Bray reported from London and Nicola Clark from Paris.
