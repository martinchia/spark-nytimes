The family that controls the Swiss specialty chemical maker Sika has called for the removal of several directors who have opposed the sale of the familyâs controlling stake to the French conglomerate Saint-Gobain, Sika said on Wednesday. On Monday, Saint-Gobain said it planned to buy a controlling stake in Sika held by the Burkard family for about $2.8 billion, against the wishes of the company’sÂ board of directors and management. In a news release on Wednesday, Sika said that Schenker-Winkler Holding, a company owned by the Burkard family, hadÂ called for an extraordinary general meeting to remove Paul J. HÃ¤lg, Sikaâs chairman, and two board members, Monika Ribar and Daniel J. Sauter. Mr. Sauter is the chairman of Swiss private bank Julius Baer Group. The Burkard family, which already has three directors affiliated with Schenker-Winkler on Sikaâs board, wants to replace Mr. HÃ¤lg, Ms. Ribar and Mr. Sauter with a slate of its own nominees, Sika said. âThe board of directors will examine the request and proposals and will comment in due course,â Sika said in a news release on Wednesday. The announcement is the latest development in a takeover battle that broke out on Monday after Sika said its leadership did not support the change of control and was not consulted on a proposed sale of Schenker-Winkler to Saint-Gobain for 2.75 billion Swiss francs, or about $2.82 billion. Schenker-Winkler holds 16.1 percent of Sikaâs capital and 52.4 percent of its voting rights. Because of its unusual ownership structure, 84 percent of Sika is owned by public shareholders, but the Burkard family controls its voting rights. The familyâs ties to the company date back to Kaspar Winkler, whoÂ founded Sika in 1910. Saint-Gobain said on Monday that it did not intend to make an offer for the remaining shares of Sika. Sika said on Monday that its management and ânonconflictedâ directors would resign if the transaction was consummated. âUnlike the family, Saint-Gobain is an industrial investor and numerous conflicts to the detriment of the public shareholders could arise,â Sika said on Monday. Sika is one of the worldâs largest makers of specialty chemicals for the construction industry, including adhesives and sealants used in waterproofing and soundproofing. It employs more than 16,000 people in 84 countries and posted revenue of 5.14 billion francs in 2013. Saint-Gobain, which traces its roots to 1665, produces flat glass and high-performance materials for the housing and industrial markets, as well as iron pipes and building materials for the construction industry. It employs about 190,000 people in 64 countries and posted revenue of 42 billion euros, or $52 billion, in 2013. Sikaâs shares declined 4.6 percent, to 2,341.93 francs, in midday trading in Zurich on Wednesday. Advertisement
