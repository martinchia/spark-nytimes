In light of the Census Bureau’s release on Tuesday of data from the American Community Survey, a blogger from The Big Picture who writes under the pseudonym Invictus suggested we investigate how income may have affected the 2008 presidential election. Both Democrats and Republicans claim to be the champions of the middle-class and poor; who actually won their votes? With Invictus’s help, I put together theÂ  scatterplot below. The horizontal axis shows median household income for 2005-09 in a given county, and the vertical axis shows the share of that county that voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 general election. There is some positive relationship between median household income and voting. But as you can see, the correlation isÂ  weak — “What’s the Matter With Kansas?” and other popular impressions of working-class voting habits notwithstanding.
