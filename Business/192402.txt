A potential deal to create the world’s largest mining company is off the table, at least for now. Late Monday in New York, Rio Tinto, the British-Australian mining giant, said that it had been approached by its smaller rival Glencore about a $150 billion merger, but declined to pursue a deal. Bringing together Rio Tinto, worth about $100 billion, and Glencore, worth about $50 billion, would have created a global powerhouse in iron, nickel and copper production. Earlier on Monday, Bloomberg reported that Glencore chief executive Ivan Glasenberg was laying the groundwork for a combination of the two companies. But Rio Tinto said no talks were active. “The Rio Tinto board confirms that no discussions are taking place with Glencore,” the company said in a statement. “In July 2014, Glencore contacted Rio Tinto regarding a potential merger of Rio Tinto and Glencore. The Rio Tinto board, after consultation with its financial and legal advisers, concluded unanimously that a
combination was not in the best interests of Rio Tintoâs shareholders.” Rio Tinto said it declined to pursue a deal about two months ago. “The boardâs rejection was communicated to Glencore in early August and there has been no further contact between the companies on this matter,” the company said. “Rio Tinto remains focused on the successful execution of its strategy, which the board of Rio Tinto is confident will continue to deliver significant and sustainable value for shareholders.” Rio Tinto’s London shares jumped on Tuesday, and were up more than 5 percent in afternoon trading.  For Glencore’s chief executive, Mr. Glasenberg, the impending retirement of Rio Tinto’s chief executive, Sam Walsh, represents an opportunity to amass yet more influence over the global commodities business. Mr. Glasenberg, an ambitious executive born in South Africa, has already transformed Glencore from a small trading house into one of the biggest mining companies in the world. But a deal to combine Rio Tinto and Glencore, creating the world’s biggest mining company, would be certain to face stiff antitrust scrutiny. And on Monday, Rio Tinto said it was committed to its plan as a standalone company. “The board believes that the continued successful execution of Rio Tintoâs strategy will allow Rio Tinto to increase free cash flow significantly in the near term and materially increase returns to shareholders,” Rio Tinto’s chairman, Jan du Plessis, said in a statement. “Rio Tintoâs shareholders stand to benefit from the very considerable value that this will generate.â Advertisement
