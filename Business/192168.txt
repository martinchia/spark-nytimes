Bound by a mutual love for animated animals â and profits â Jeffrey Katzenberg, chief executive of DreamWorks Animation SKG, has joined Zynga’s board, the company announced Monday.  Mr. Katzenberg, whose production company is behind hits like “Shrek” and “Kung Fu Panda,” is joining a board that includes Zynga’s chief executive, Mark Pincus; its executive vice president, Owen Van Natta; LinkedIn’s founder, Reid Hoffman; a Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers partner, Bing Gordon; and Brad Feld, a managing director at the Foundry Group.  âZynga has quickly become one of today’s most innovative and entertaining companies,â Mr. Katzenberg said in a statement. âI think Mark has an incredible vision for the future of this company and I couldnât be more excited to become a part of it.â In a short span of time, Zynga, founded in 2007, has become one of the largest gaming companies on the Web, driven by the viral success of games like FarmVille and CityVille. All together, Zyngaâs games attract more than 275 million users every month on Facebook, making it the most popular gaming service on the platform and a major contributor to the social networkâs revenue. Below is Mr. Pincus’s full blog post on Mr. Katzenberg’s move: Today weâre incredibly excited to announce that Jeffrey Katzenberg, C.E.O. of DreamWorks Animation, has joined Zyngaâs Board of Directors. Jeffrey and I have been friends for some time, and I knew heâd be a great fit for the board after he suggested that the blockbuster of 2011 could be ShrekVille. I see a lot of similarities between DreamWorks Animation and Zynga, far beyond our love of animals. DreamWorks Animation is a revolutionary technology company, a recognized consumer brand, and at its core, a media company. Itâs easy to see the value that Jeffrey will add to Zynga as we grow and look for more ways to delight our players. In fact, heâs immediately sprung into action with his first assignment: finding our seventh board member. I hear that both Jack Black and Mike Myers are incredibly interested. I and everyone here at Zynga would like to extend a warm welcome to Jeffrey. Iâm looking forward to his guidance, his leadership, and about 1,500 tickets to the opening night of Kung Fu Panda 2.
