After nine months of AT&T fiercely defending its $39 billion bid for T-Mobile USA in public and in court, the company finally agreed on Monday to end its takeover effort. When a hotly contested $39 billion takeover falls apart, plenty of parties will have something to say. And so AT&T’s decision drew a slew of responses from the deal’s chief opponents, including government regulators and corporate rivals like Sprint Nextel. We’ve compiled statements about the deal below. James Cole, the Justice Department’s deputy attorney general: This result is a victory for the millions of Americans who use mobile wireless telecommunications services. A significant competitor remains in the marketplace and consumers will benefit from a quick resolution of this matter without the unnecessary expense of taxpayer money and government resources. Sharis A. Pozen, the acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust team: Consumers won today. Had AT&T acquired T-Mobile, consumers in the wireless marketplace would have faced higher prices and reduced innovation. We sued to protect consumers who rely on competition in this important industry. With the partiesâ abandonment, we achieved that result. Julius Genachowski, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission: The FCC is committed to ensuring a competitive mobile marketplace that drives innovation and investment, creates jobs and benefits consumers. This deal would have done the opposite. The U.S. mobile industry leads the world in mobile innovation, and we agree with AT&T that Congress should pass incentive auction legislation that will unleash new spectrum for mobile broadband. Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile’s parent company: Both companies are in agreement that the broad opposition by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the U.S. telecommunications regulator (FCC) is making it increasingly unlikely that the transaction will close. Both companies are of the opinion that important arguments in support of the transaction have been ignored, such as the significant improvement in high-speed mobile network coverage for the U.S. market, as well as the positive employment effects. In addition there was no indication that either authority would move away from its non-supportive stance in return for concessions from the parties in terms of the scope and structure of the transaction. Vonya B. McCann, Sprint’s senior vice president of government affairs: This is the right decision for consumers, competition and innovation in the wireless industry. From the beginning, Sprint has stood with consumers who spoke loudly and clearly that AT&Tâs proposed takeover of T-Mobile would create an undeniable duopoly that would have resulted in higher prices, less innovation and fewer choices for the American consumer.
