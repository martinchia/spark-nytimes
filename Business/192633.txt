KINDER MORGAN TO REORGANIZE  |  The pipeline group Kinder Morgan, the biggest of the master limited partnerships, announced on Sunday that it would acquire its three associated companies and reorganize as one corporation based in Houston, DealBookâs David Gelles writes. The new Kinder Morgan will have an estimated enterprise value of about $140 billion â $100 billion of market value and $40 billion of debt â  making it the third-biggest energy company in the United States, after Exxon Mobil and Chevron. Under the dealâs terms, Kinder Morgan, which encompasses a huge network of oil and gas pipelines across North America, will acquire its two related M.L.P.s â Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and El Paso Pipeline Partners â and a third related company, Kinder Morgan Management, for $71 billion. Kinder Morgan will pay a premium for each company and use mostly stock to finance the purchases, allowing shareholders of the three targets to essentially continue their ownership. The simplified structure will allow Kinder Morgan to become more acquisitive in a new United States oil and gas boom, Mr. Gelles writes. The move will also free up cash for the company to invest in new capital expenditures needed to accommodate new reserves of natural gas being tapped across North America. The Kinder Morgan empire will no longer have the advantages of M.L.P.s, but the combined company is expected to continue to pay a generous dividend. 

DROP IN TREASURY YIELDS BAFFLES EXPERTS   |  Over the last several years, Wall Street analysts have been expecting that yields in the bond market would inevitably rise. Lately, however, that has not been the case, Jeff Sommer writes in DealBook. On Friday, the 10-year Treasury note fell as low as 2.35 percent, its lowest point since June 20, 2013, before settling at 2.42 percent. Yields have been falling consistently in 2014 despite forecasts to the contrary from most analysts at the beginning of the year, Mr. Sommer adds. The yield on the 10-year note was relatively unchanged on Monday morning.
The bond market has been responding to current events, including a sluggish global economy and rising geopolitical tensions. In response, investors worldwide have been curbing the risk in their portfolios and moving money into safer holdings. United States Treasuries remain high on the list of global safe havens, Mr. Sommer writes, and demand for Treasuries has driven prices higher and pushed down yields. Yields on a range of bonds, including 10-year German sovereign debt, have also been extraordinarily low.
Several false starts seemed to indicate that yields would rise, but predictions that the trend would continue have proved false. The bond rally has gained fresh legs this year while the rally in the stock market has, at least briefly, faltered. âWe donât know how long the bond rally will continue, of course,â Mr. Sommer writes. âBut in the words of a sage, Yogi Berra: It ainât over till itâs over.â



FUNDS WEIGH ACTION AGAINST PORTUGUESE REGULATORS  |  Hedge fund investors, furious at having their bond holdings in Portugalâs Banco EspÃ­rito Santo written down to zero, are considering legal action against Portuguese regulators, Landon Thomas Jr. writes in DealBook. According to bankers and lawyers involved in the effort, the funds include Daniel S. Loebâs Third Point and GLG in London and smaller outfits that specialize in distressed bonds like Aurelius, Golden Tree and VR Global.
The bonds in question were an especially risky variety of junior securities that Banco EspÃ­rito Santo issued late last year, Mr. Thomas writes. Holders of these high-risk bonds have been assigned to the so-called bad bank it recently set up, which houses about 4 billion euros, or $5.36 billion, of nonperforming loans that the bank made to its struggling group companies. The investor group contends that some faulty loans made by Banco EspÃ­rito Santoâs banking subsidiary in Angola, Banco EspÃ­rito Santo Angola, have gone to the good bank and not the bad bank where they rightly belong.
âThe episode highlights the extent to which rock-bottom interest rates in the United States have pushed many investors to make risky bets on high-yielding bank and government bonds in Portugal and Greece,â Mr. Thomas writes. âFor more than a year, these investments have reaped rich returns. But as worries build about Europeâs ability to grow and the ability of its banks to withstand increasingly bad loans, many of these highflying stocks and bonds have reversed direction.â



ON THE AGENDA  |  Stanley Fischer, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, gives a speech on the great recession at a conference hosted by the Swedish Ministry of Finance at 3:15 a.m. Eastern time.




BANKS SHUDDER WHEN SHE TALKS  |  After years of quixotic advocacy, Anat R. Admati, a Stanford finance professor and persistent industry gadfly, is now reaching some very prominent ears, including President Obamaâs, Binyamin Appelbaum writes in The New York Times. âMs. Admatiâs simple message is that the government is overlooking the best way to strengthen the financial system,â he adds. âRegulators, she says, need to worry less about what banks do with their money, and more about where the money comes from.â
Companies other than banks get money largely by selling shares to investors or by reinvesting profit. But banks can rely almost entirely on borrowed funds, including the money they get from depositors. Ms. Admati contends that banks are taking bigger risks than other kinds of companies because they use other peopleâs money, and the results are that they keep crashing the economy, Mr. Appelbaum writes. Ms. Admatiâs solution, he adds, is to force banks to reduce their reliance on borrowed money, which would probably make the banking industry stodgier and less profitable â reducing the economic risks, the executive bonuses and, for shareholders, both the risks and the profits.
