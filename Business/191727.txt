Even before Steven A. Cohen’s very bad week, the media narrative surrounding the hedge fund billionaire was well known: an intimidating temper that has mellowed with age, a bad back enflamed by the same, a hedge fund with a track record better than the Yankees and partial ownership of a baseball team whose standing is decidedly less stellar. This week, we review the highlights. Like many billionaires Mr. Cohen, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing, shuns the media spotlight, but that hasn’t stopped journalists and colleagues from painting colorful portraits that compare him to characters from Henry Melville and Miguel de Cervantes. âItâs a Darwinian and pressure-packed culture with ridiculous amounts of money at stake,â a former employee of SAC Capital told DealBook last year.  The closest Mr. Cohen has gotten to a media grilling recently was a sit-down with Paul Tudor Jones, another hedge fund manager, at a Wall Street-sponsored conference. Mr. Cohen is “almost as secretive as Howard Hughes,” one source told Businessweek in 2003. The comparison has stuck with the money manager despite his prominent forays into worlds of art, sports and politics.  In 2006, his hedge fund was focus of a widely criticized “60 Minutes” report on short sellers. His ex-wife, Patricia Cohen, told New York magazine that the television report was the impetus for her lawsuit over money involved in their 1990 divorce. The suit was later dismissed. As the charges against former traders at his $14 billion hedge fund mounted, Mr. Cohen gave a rare interview in 2010 to Vanity Fair, saying that “in some respects I feel like Don Quixote fighting windmills.” Or perhaps Mr. Cohen is, as Reuters described last year, the Feds’ Moby Dick, an allegory that would make Robert S. Mueller, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a modern-day empty-handed Captain Ahab. In the end, the high-minded literary references may not capture Mr. Cohenâs story as well as a man who inspired Bruce Springsteen, New Jerseyâs true poet laureate. It could be that Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, could write the hedge fund titanâs final chapter.
