The private equity giant Carlyle Group reported lower third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, amid a slow period in selling its investments. The company said it earned $195 million before taxes in the quarter, a decline of 11 percent from the period a year earlier. That pretax measure of profit, known as economic net income, accounts for unrealized investment gains and excludes certain costs. After taxes, Carlyle said it earned $160.2 million, or what amounted to 51 cents a share, falling short of the estimate of 60 cents a share by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Carlyle said the value of its overall portfolio from which it collects profit rose 4 percent in the quarter, while its private equity funds were up 5 percent. Its other assets, including real estate, had more modest gains. In certain real estate investments in Latin America and Europe, Carlyle experienced losses, the firm said on Wednesday, without going into detail. The firm said its realized net performance fees in the third quarter â from gains in its investments â were $61 million, less than half of the $156 million it recorded in the third quarter of 2012. Carlyleâs results lagged behind two big rivals, Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company and the Blackstone Group, which both reported higher earnings in the third quarter. With stock markets rising, many private equity firms have been moving to sell their holdings to the investing public. But for Carlyle, the third quarter was a relatively slow one when it came to âexitsâ — industry parlance for realizing gains on investments. The firm said its distributable earnings in the quarter, a measure of payouts to investors in its funds, amounted to $105 million before taxes, a steep drop from $207 million in the period a year earlier. “Our business is inherently long-term and not one that is driven by quarter-to-quarter milestones,â David M. Rubenstein, the firmâs co-chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. âWe are working on a number of exits that are likely to produce healthy performance fees in the near term.” William E. Conway Jr., the other co-chief executive, pointed to certain initial public offerings of Carlyle portfolio companies, including the CommScope Holding Company, that are too recent to be reflected in the third-quarter results. CommScope achieved a market valuation of $2.8 billion in its I.P.O. in October, though its stock is roughly flat compared with its initial price. Mr. Conway added that the “public markets have been great,â saying the gains in Carlyleâs public company portfolio outpaced those of its private portfolio. “We think nowâs a pretty good time to be exiting,â he said. One bright spot for Carlyle was fund-raising: It brought in $6.5 billion in new capital in the third quarter, as it secured commitments from existing investors and attracted new ones. “We continue to see strong interest from fund investors for Carlyle products, and our overall pace of fund-raising is the highest since 2007,â Mr. Rubenstein said in a statement. The firmâs total assets under management rose to $185 billion in the third quarter, 18 percent higher than in the period a year earlier. Big private equity companies like Carlyle prefer to report results as economic net income. Using generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Carlyle had income of $2.3 million in the quarter, compared with $18.6 million in the period a year earlier.
