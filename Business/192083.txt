Not only do foreign deals have their quirks, but so do deals in the United States once you go outside Delaware. Each is a periodic theme of this column, but they were again  illustrated in two deals announced this week:   PepsiCoâs agreement to acquire Wimm-Bill-Dann for $3.8 billion and ABBâs $3.1 billion agreement to acquire Baldor.   Wimm-Bill-Dann is the not only Pepsiâs largest international acquisition but is the biggest American acquisition of a Russian company ever. Wimm-Bill-Dann, a Russian corporation, was founded in 1992 and went public on the New York Stock Exchange back in 2002.   The company had flirted with Danone for years and came close to being acquired by the French company about seven years ago.  (Full disclosure â I was one of the lawyers representing Danone on this potential transaction back in another life when I was a lawyer in London). A deal was never publicly announced, but the relationship continued and Danone ultimately built an 18.4 percent stake in Wimm-Bill-Dann. This past October Danone sold these shares back to Wimm-Bill Dann for $470 million. This works out to a per-share price nearly half what Pepsi is now offering.  Danone sold its stake in connection with Danoneâs decision to focus on its investments in the Russian dairy producer Unimilk.   Pepsi has structured the acquisition in two parts.  In the first part, Pepsi agreed to buy for $3.8 billion 66 percent of Wimm-Bill-Dann from the company itself, its founders and certain other insiders.  In the second part, Pepsi will start a tender offer for the remaining, publicly held Wimm-Bill-Dann shares.   If this were a United States deal, it would probably be structured as a single transaction. The acquirer would announce a tender offer and significant shareholders would simply agree with the buyer to tender into the offer.
In this case, this transaction was probably structured in a different manner for two reasons. First, the selling shareholders wanted to make sure that their shares were purchased first as quickly as possible without getting caught up in a public offer process. Pepsi was likely amenable because this route assured it control on a more timely basis. The second reason is related to the Russian nature of the deal. In Russia, share ownership from companies founded back in the 1990s is always murky. In fact, the annual report of Wimm-Bill-Dann has as a risk factor that its ownership of some subsidiaries may be subject to challenge under Russiaâs privatization laws. Wimm-Bill-Dann is now run to Western standards, but it still has some of the wild taint of Russia.   Gavril A. Yushvaev is Wimm-Bill-Dannâs largest shareholder, a director and a billionaire.  Wimm-Bill-Dann has disclosed that he served nine years in the 1980s in a Soviet prison camp for an unnamed violent crime.  By purchasing the shares directly, Pepsi can ameliorate this and other Russian issues.  First, a separate agreement allows Pepsi to obtain broad representations from these shareholders as to the validity of their share ownership as well as Wimm-Bill-Dannâs ownership of its subsidiaries.  Second, Wimm-Bill-Dann has tangled relationships with its insiders and their affiliated companies. A separate agreement allows the parties to privately agree how to untangle these relationships.  Finally, a separate agreement allows the parties to better structure around tax and currency issues.  Notice here that the buyer is Pepsi Bermuda and the sellers are individuals and companies that appear to be based in Cyprus, a common tax haven for Russians.   The Pepsi/Wimm-Bill-Dann agreement has not been made public, but at least some of these factors were likely addressed in it.   There is also the rule of law to consider.  Suing these sellers in Russia under Russian law would be quite difficult. And Russian courts are susceptible to being manipulated.  A separate purchase agreement allows Pepsi to try to sidestep the issue and obtain the selling shareholders’ agreement to arbitrate any dispute. The arbitration would occur outside Russia under international arbitration rules.  Russia is a party to the New York Convention on the Enforcement and Recognition of Foreign Arbitral Awards so theoretically a Russian court would enforce any such arbitration award.   A separate purchase is thus more optimal to deal with these âRussianâ issues; in truth these are problems which often also arise in other countries.  And under Russian law, Wimm-Bill-Dann is required to make an offer to public shareholders to acquire their shares once it acquires more than 60 percent of Wimm-Bill-Dann.  Note that Rule 14e-5 under the Williams Act prohibits purchases outside a tender offer while it is pending. So, you cannot have the tender offer pending if a separate share purchase like the one here completes during the tender offerâs pendency. One has to happen after the other, and hence the lack of overlap.  ABB was in much more familiar territory when it acquired Baldor, but it still had its own special obstacles.  And not just because ABB is a foreign buyer. Baldor is not incorporated in Delaware, but in Missouri, meaning that stateâs law governs. Missouri has a requirement that 66.66 percent of shares must approve a merger instead of the usual majority of shares in Delaware. ABB is acquiring Baldor pursuant to a tender offer, but that is why the tender offer has the 66.66 percent condition. ABB wants to ensure it acquires enough shares to vote through a merger to squeeze-out the remaining shares.
Under Missouri law, an acquirer also cannot use a note to purchase shares from a Missouri company.   This law creates a problem because buyers typically pay for the shares purchased in a top-up option, a common feature in tender offers, with a note.  The reason the dilution associated with a top-up exercise.  If ABB acquires 70 percent of Baldorâs shares, it would require about $6.5 billion in cash to purchase enough shares under the top-up to bring it to the necessary squeeze-out threshold of 90 percent share ownership.  ABB is rich enough that it can arrange for this amount of short-term financing, and so in this agreement there is a top-up option where the option price is payable in cash.   Daniel Wolf, Thomas W. Christopher and Yi (Claire) Sheng at Kirkland and Ellis represented ABB in this transaction.  Kirkland capitalized on their experience and issued a wonky memo  about the quirks of tender offers for companies in Missouri and other states outside Delaware. It is worth a read.  Another quirk in the ABB acquisition agreement  is the size of the termination fee.  It is a relatively low 3.33 percent of equity and 2.7 percent of enterprise value. Delaware generally measures termination fees off of equity value and has typically allowed fees of 3 to 4 percent of such value.   From a legal standpoint, ABB likely could have negotiated a much higher fee than it did without challenge. This is particularly true since Missouri would likely be more lenient on this issue than Delaware.  That ABB didnât was probably a result of an agreement by the business people rather than a legal decision.  Finally, the ABB acquisition is conditioned on ABB obtaining national security clearance from the federal Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or C.F.I.U.S. Baldor produces industrial motors and there doesnât appear to be any risk at all here.  So, I suspect this is a âbetter safe than sorryâ condition.    It is clear evidence of the creep of C.F.I.U.S. fears when you can convince a seller that a Swiss buyer of a motor company with negligible government business deserves a C.F.I.U.S. condition.  Expect more of these conditions.  Targets would do well to at least push back or demand a real reverse termination fee. If they are actually going to agree to this condition, a target should be compensated if it is set off.  Advertisement
