LONDON â The CME Group said on Thursday that it had hired the former head of NYSE Euronext’s operations in Amsterdam as the chief executive of its London derivatives business, which had its debut this year. Cees Vermaas, who had been chief executive of NYSE Euronext Amsterdam since June 2010, is set to become managing director and chief executive of CME Europe Limited beginning on Jan. 2. His appointment is subject to approval by British regulators. Mr. Vermaas will report to William Knottenbelt, the CME Group senior managing director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. âHis deep exchange experience, coupled with his strong understanding of the diverse needs of European market participants for risk management and liquidity access in local jurisdictions, will be a tremendous resource as we look to extend our product offering across multiple asset classes,” Mr. Knottenbelt said in a news release on Thursday. Mr. Vermaas began his career in 1992 as head of information technology and logistics for a unit of the Dutch electronics maker Philips and worked for a variety of companies in the Netherlands. He joined Euronext Amsterdam in 2001. Euronext was acquired by the New York Stock Exchange in 2007. IntercontinentalExchange, based in Atlanta, agreed to acquire NYSE Euronext in 2012 and spun off Euronext in an initial public offering in June. The appointment of Mr. Vermaas comes at an important time for CME, the operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange. CME is looking to increase its operations in Europe through its London-based derivatives operations, which started in April, and a clearing business that it opened in May 2011. In July, CME announced that it had agreed to acquire the GFI Group in an all-share deal worth about $580 million. CME, which would sell part of GFIâs operations after the deal, is looking to acquire GFIâs European energy-trading business and foreign exchange option trading platform. But it is facing a challenge from BGC Partners, a New York brokerage rival to GFI. On Tuesday, BGC, which owns about 13.5 percent of GFI, offered to pay about $675 million in cash for the firm and said it planned to bring its own offer to shareholders.
