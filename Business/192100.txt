Bank of America closed its wholesale mortgage-lending operations on Tuesday, steering business away from mortgage brokers and toward loans to consumers and community banks, The Wall Street Journal reported. The bankâs move may have the effect of limiting consumer choice in the mortgage rate market and promote Wells Fargo to the dominant position in the wholesale business, The Journal noted. However, Barbara Desoer, president of Bank of America Home Loans, stressed that the lenderâs decision would allow it to play to its strengths and have a more direct relationship with its customers. “We tend to prefer business where we have scale,” Ms. Desoer told The Journal. “We love the direct-to-consumer business because it’s very closely aligned with the consumer franchise that Bank of America has.” The Journal writes: About 1,000 employees will be affected, with some jobs lost. Many staffers will be offered the chance to transfer to other loan units â including correspondent, largely community banks, retail sales working directly with consumers and warehouse lending, which provides short-term loans to small, independent mortgage banks, letting them fund home mortgages. Some people “really question whether there’s a lot of future in wholesale lending,” Glen Corso, managing director of the Community Mortgage Banking Project, told The Journal, explaining why the bank had taken this decision. “They feel like brokers are really going to be under a microscope from here on out.” Go to Article from The Wall Street Journal (Subscription Required) Â» Advertisement
