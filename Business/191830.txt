Cengage Learning, a private-equity-backed education company,  agreed on Friday to acquire National Geographic’s digital and print school publishing unit.  The unit includes the National Geographic Science series,  National Geographic Explorer! Magazines and Hampton Brownâs literacy and language programs. Terms were not disclosed. The deal extends a partnership between Cengage and the National Geographic Society. Since 2007, they have collaborated to produce English-language learning materials. Ronald Dunn, the chief executive of Cengage, said that the agreement “gives us a stronger foothold in a market of one billion learners and allows us to better capitalize on the growing global demand for advanced learning materials.”    Cengage, based in Stamford, Conn., was named Thomson Learning in 2007 when Apax Partners and Omers Capital Partners — a private equity  unit of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board pension fund – acquired it for a reported $7.75 billion. The following year, Cengage acquired the college publishing division of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing. Advertisement
