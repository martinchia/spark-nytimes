Apparently there is some truth to that stereotype of today’s 20-somethings being stuck in an extended adolescence — but if so, it seems to be mostly their own parents’ doing. A new poll from Pew Research Center finds that expectations for when young adults should be financially independent have gotten laxer over the years: As you can see, in 1993, 80 percent of parents with children age 16 or younger said they expected their children to be financially independent by age 22. As of 2011, only 67 percent of parents agreed. (The choices offered in the poll were ages 18, 22, 25, 30, and Never.) Ask that same question of young people (ages 18 to 34) today, and the expectations are about the same. But Americans who have children over 18 and Americans who are over age 50 are far more tolerant of children’s financial dependence later in life: Of survey respondents with adult children, 46 percent say children can rely on their parents for financial support after age 22. Of respondents who are older than 50, regardless of their parental status, a similar share (44 percent) has this mindset. I’m surprised — I would have expected that children would act more entitled to parental financial support than their parents expected them to be. Another interesting finding of the poll, in any case, was the different genders’ attitudes about the economic challenges that face them. Among young people (age 18-34), women were substantially more likely to say that it’s harder for todayâs young adults than it was for their parentsâ generation to achieve things like employment, college admission and homeownership: Perhaps this explains why young women are investing in higher education at much higher rates than their male counterparts: With a more pessimistic view of the socioeconomic conditions ahead of them, young women are more likely to go the extra mile to prepare themselves.
