LONDON â Ziggo, the largest provider of cable television services in the Netherlands, has rejected a buyout offer from Liberty Global, the media company controlled by John C. Malone, the company said on Wednesday. The company said it had received a âpreliminary proposalâ from Liberty Global, but considered the offer âinadequate.â It did not disclose details about the offer. âThere is no certainty that Ziggo will receive any revised offer,â the company said in a statement on Wednesday. Ziggo, based in Utrecht, the Netherlands, provides cable television, broadband and telephone service to about 2.8 million households. The German magazine Manager Magazin reported on Wednesday that Liberty Global, one of Ziggoâs largest shareholders, was planning to buy out the company and merge it with two others Liberty Global already owns â UPC Netherlands, the second-largest cable provider in the Netherlands, and Belgiumâs Telenet. Last year, Liberty Global paid $2.5 billion to buy the remaining half of Telenet Group it did not previously own. Liberty Global acquired a controlling stake in the Belgium cable company in 2007. Liberty Global, the international broadband arm of Mr. Maloneâs media and telecommunications empire, also owns Virgin Media in Britain and Unity Media in Germany. A Liberty Global spokesman was not immediately available to comment Wednesday. Shares in Ziggo, which also offers a music streaming service and owns the Ziggo Dome concert site in Amsterdam, were up nearly 7 percent, at 31.20 euros ($42.06) in late afternoon trading.
