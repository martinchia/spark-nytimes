UBS Reports $2 Billion Loss to Rogue Trader  |  UBS said on Thursday that a rogue trader in its investment bank had lost $2 billion, delivering a fresh blow to the struggling Swiss bank.

In an internal memo, UBS said the unauthorized trading could drag down earnings in the third quarter, adding that âno client positionsâ were involved in the âunauthorized trades.â
