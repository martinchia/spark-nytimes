When the tobacco company Reynolds American confirmed on Friday that it was in discussions with Lorillard about a multibillion-dollar merger, the news hardly came as a surprise.  Since May, when Susan M. Cameron rejoined Reynolds as president and chief executive, the tobacco industry has been anticipating such a deal.  And as the tobacco industry continues to navigate significant challenges, including sharply declining smoking rates, the hiring of Ms. Cameron, the first woman to lead a big tobacco company and a longtime industry executive, was seen as a sign that there were probably changes afoot. âSusanâs 30 years of experience with our companies and her previous service in this role make her an exemplary choice for this key leadership position,â Thomas C. Wajnert, the nonexecutive chairman of Reynolds, said in a statement announcing the move in April. âWeâre pleased to have her back with the company to further our vision of transforming tobacco.â Ms. Cameron now finds herself again at the helm of the second-largest tobacco producer in the United States, poised to reshape an industry she almost never joined. After graduating from college, Ms. Cameron â who holds business administration degrees from the University of Florida and Bellarmine University in Kentucky â took a job that she âended up hating,â she said in an interview in Time magazine in 2010.   âI decided I would change jobs and choose an industry whose products I personally enjoyed,â she said. âI narrowed it down to cosmetics, alcohol and tobacco.â  She chose tobacco and began her new career in 1981 at Brown & Williamson, a subsidiary of British American Tobacco, as a sales representative. She worked her way to chief executive in 2001. She became president and chief executive of the newly formed Reynolds American, based in Winston-Salem, N.C., in 2004, when R.J. Reynolds Tobacco merged with Brown & Williamson in a $3 billion deal.  After the deal, Ms. Cameron worked to integrate two different sets of corporate values. âWe wanted to create a culture that was forward-looking and energized, as well as productive and efficient,â Ms. Cameron told The Winston-Salem Journal in February 2011. “That culture has enabled Reynolds to compete successfully and profitably across the tobacco spectrum. That has been very satisfying.” A lot of mergers fail “because management ignores culture,” she said. Ms. Cameron was named chairworman of Reynolds American in 2006. During her tenure at the helm of Reynolds, she transformed the company by reducing its reliance on cigarettes and cutting costs. In 2006, the company dipped its toe into the smokeless tobacco industry, purchasing Conwood, the second-largest manufacturer of smokeless tobacco in the United States at the time, for $3.5 billion.  (An analyst said Reynolds had âpaid through the nose for this business.â) Ms. Cameron also tried to move Reynolds into other smokeless areas, including snus, a type of spitless tobacco. In October 2010, Ms. Cameron, who previously went by the last name Ivey, announced she was retiring.  Her decision, at 51, raised questions among analysts because she was seen as young for a chief executive. But the reaction in Winston-Salem was one of appreciation, almost love. In the Winston-Salem Journal article, Mayor Allen Joines called her an “extraordinary leader.â Members of the community praised her dedication to womenâs leadership initiatives. But Ms. Cameron, who has been featured on a number of lists of the most powerful women in business, did not stay away from Reynolds American for long. In December 2013, she was back at the company, as a director. On May 1, she took over as president and chief executive. Reynolds Americanâs âstrategic mission to transform the tobacco industry is a fascinating journey,â Ms. Cameron said in a statement at the time of the announcement. âIâm looking forward to the opportunity to not just advance, but accelerate, that momentum.â Advertisement
