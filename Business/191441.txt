LONDON â Kweku M. Adoboli, the former UBS trader charged with fraud and false accounting, has dumped his law firm days before his next court hearing where he was expected to enter a plea. Mr. Adoboli recently dropped Kingsley Napley, which previously represented the rogue trader Nick Leeson and also advises Rebekah Brooks, the former News Corporation executive, a spokeswoman for the law firm said. Mr. Adoboli, who was arrested in September after UBS uncovered a $2.3 billion loss related to unauthorized trades, is now represented by lawyers at Bark & Company, another London-based law firm focusing on fraud and serious crime cases. Mr. Adoboli, 31, surprised the court last month when instead of entering a plea, his lawyer asked for an additional four weeks so that his team could look at evidence and for Mr. Adoboli to get more legal advice. Mr. Adoboli is expected to appear at Londonâs Southwark Crown Court on Dec. 20. It would be his fifth court appearance since he was taken into custody and charged with two counts of fraud and two counts of false accounting. The trading loss at UBS led to the resignation of Oswald J. GrÃ¼bel as chief executive and the departure of a handful of senior managers in the equities division, where Mr. Adoboli worked. In a court hearing in September, Mr. Adoboliâs lawyer said his client was âsorry beyond words for what had happenedâ and that âhe stands now appalled at the scale of the consequences of his disastrous miscalculations.â  Advertisement
