5:26 p.m. | Updated to reflect Thursday’s closing stock prices. My colleague Peter Lattman wrote on Twitter that the rise in Apple’s stock on Thursday meant that its market value was higher than Microsoft and Google combined. For more details, check out an Apple Insider post this morning.Â  Here are a few other comparisons: â¢ With a market value of about $460 billion, Apple is worth more than Google, Goldman Sachs, General Motors, Ford, Starbucks and Boeing combined. â¢ Apple is now worth almost twice as much as Microsoft (about $258 billion) and more than twice as much as Google ($198 billion). â¢ It is also worth more than twice as much as General Electric (about $202 billion), I.B.M. (about $224 billion) or Wal-Mart ($212 billion). â¢ Apple — ranked 35th in theÂ Fortune 500, which is based on annual sales — is worth eight times as much as the company just below it on the Fortune list (Boeing, at about $56.5Â  billion). Its value is 20 times as much as the company just above it (Medco Health Solutions, about $23.4 billion). Apple’s stock closed up about 3.5 percent on Thursday, at $493.17.
