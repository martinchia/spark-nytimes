The World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, officially began on Wednesday, bringing thousands of world leaders and their entourages to a remote alpine outpost.  There, the megamachers will spend several days discussing, among other topics, sluggish economic growth, the sovereign debt mess in Europe and the merits of fur-lined boots. As the rarified kaffeeklatsch gets under way, we will be bringing you select highlights from the events. Capitalism: Yea or Nay?: Wednesday brought the âTIME Davos Debate on Capitalism,” which featured panelists including Brian T. Moynihan, the chief executive of Bank of America; David M. Rubenstein of the Carlyle Group; and Ben Verwaayen, chief of Alcatel-Lucent. The group made no front-page news, and Ryan McCarthy of Reuters noted sadly that there was “almost nothing in the way of real debate” on the panel. One mildly interesting piece of the TIME non-debate debate came when Mr. Moynihan was asked about banks that were accused of being “too big to fail.” His response: @mccarthyryanj Ryan McCarthy BofA CEO: we have to have “size” and “scale” to serve our clients around the world #DAVOS #Capitalism #wef Wed Jan 25 8:38:54  via Ryan McCarthy In more pressing news, Mr. McCarthy said in another Twitter message that Mr. Moynihan was wearing “the best boots I’ve seen at #davos: jet black lace ups polished to a high sheen.” Discussing Dystopia: Henry Blodget of Business Insider (who, like last year, has already unpacked this year’s Davos swag bag) is sending dispatches from a post-lunch forum on global economic risk, featuring the economist and author Nouriel Roubini and several leaders of nonprofits. Mr. Roubini appears to be sounding his customary notes of alarm: What is connecting everyone in the world these days, continues Roubini, is economic and financial insecurity, the rise of income and wealth inequality, challenges from poverty, unemployment effects of financial crisis. Among the solutions being discussed by the panelists, Mr. Blodget says, is whether it is possible to “shift the goal of corporations from a sole focus on profit to a more balanced focus on profits, employees and customers.” Surveying the Wealth Gap: One Davos water-cooler topic this year is likely to be the rising economic disparity seen in nations around the world, and the Occupy protests that have sprung up to take on the issue. Bloomberg BusinessWeek’s Matthew G. Miller notes that while the word “inequality” only appears once in the forum’s official program of events (“and thatâs in the title of a panel about art”), some well-heeled conference attendees will most likely find themselves discussing the topic anyway. The Indian billionaire Vikas Oberoi, a Davos attendee, told the magazine, âMany who will be in Davos are the people being blamed for economic inequalities. I hope itâs not just about glamour and people having a big party.â Occupy Igloo: Speaking of Occupy, this year’s forum has gained a protest movement all its own. Reuters reports that a group of protesters has gathered in igloos in Davos to speak out against what they view as the event’s corporate elitism. “It is the decisions of the few which have led us into the crisis of recent years and now the same people are posing as the solution to these problems,” David Roth, one of the movement’s organizers, said at “Camp Igloo,” the group’s makeshift bunker, which includes two heated teepees and a kitchen. A U.N. of Parties:  The Wall Street Journal’s Stephen Fidler estimates that three topics will dominate this year’s gathering: “Gloom over Europe. Asiaâs continued rise. And snow.” Mr. Fidler notes that attendees will probably try to figure out whether Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is changing her mind about strengthening the European bailout fund. They may even corner her somewhere on the legendary Davos party circuit: The Asians are certainly dominant in party-throwing, with a little help from the Brazilians. Japan, Indonesia and Korea are hosting clashing events Thursday night, while Thailand and India go head-to-head Friday. Brazil closes out the main event with the biggest bash Saturday night. Surprise: There’s Snow!:  Polya Lesova of MarketWatch, a publication not traditionally known for its weather reportage, brought an update from the frosty front lines: While the snow is creating some logistical challenges, it certainly adds to the charm of what is already a stunning setting in the Swiss Alps. Many participants arrived here on Tuesday and they were treated to a beautiful drive or train ride from Zurich to Davos, enjoying stunning vistas of snow-covered trees and jagged peaks. You could already hear some complaints that the hectic schedule may not allow time for skiing, a pity given the ideal conditions outside. Disapproves Like Jagger: At least one titan of industry won’t make it to Davos this year. Mick Jagger, the Rolling Stones frontman and Maroon 5 muse, was supposed to join Lily Cole, a model, and Tim Berners-Lee, the Web pioneer, at a tea party and panel hosted by Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain. But Mr. Jagger bailed after complaining about being “used as a political football” in the run-up to the event. Somehow, we think Davos will survive. Advertisement
