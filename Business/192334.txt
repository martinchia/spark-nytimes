LONDON â For now, European banks with exposure to Russia donât appear too concerned about the effect on their bottom lines of economic sanctions against Moscow, but that outlook could change if the sanctions linger. On Thursday, the Austrian lender Raiffeisen Bank International and Rabobank of the Netherlands echoed comments from other European lenders in saying they expected a âlowâ or âlimitedâ impact on their earnings as a result of Western sanctions imposed on Russia over the crisis in Ukraine. Earlier this month, Federico Ghizzoni, the chief executive of Unicredit, said that the bank, Italyâs largest, expected the impact of sanctions on its business to be âmarginal.â The European Union and the United States have imposed a series of economic sanctions, including against several Russian businesses and individuals. Last month, the European Union also instituted punitive measures against Russiaâs largest bank, Sberbank, and four other Russian financial institutions. Russia responded by saying it would ban imports of food and agricultural products from the United States and Europe. But that has raised little concern for Raiffeisen Bank, which has relied on Russia for earnings growth in recent years. âThe impact of the sanctions on R.B.I.âs business is indeed very low,â Karl Sevelda, Raiffeisen Bank’s chief executive, said in a news release on Thursday. âI do not see any reason to question our business in Russia. We still consider Russia to be an attractive banking market in the medium and long term and therefore we will stay in this market.â In a report earlier this year, Fitch Ratings said that Raiffeisen Bank had exposure of about 20 billion euros, or about $26.6 billion, in Russia and that its business there accounted for 74 percent of its pretax profit in 2013. On Thursday, Raiffeisen Bank, which is based in Vienna, said profit rose 19 percent to â¬371 million in the first half of this year, up from â¬311 million in the period a year earlier. In Russia, Raiffeisen’s pretax profit declined 23 percent to â¬266 million in the first half of the year. On a pretax basis, the bank reported profit of â¬518 million. Unicreditâs Austrian subsidiary has exposure of about â¬18 billion in Russia, according to Fitch. This month, Mr. Ghizzoni, the Unicredit executive, told analysts that the sanctions would result, at most, in a reduction of revenue by â¬10 million to â¬15 million. The French bank SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale said in August that it did not expect a short-term impact from sanctions, as the measures were not aimed at its subsidiary, Rosbank. But the bank based in Paris cautioned that revenue could be affected if it was unable to proceed with transactions as a result of the sanctions. Russia accounts for about 5 percent ofÂ SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale‘s revenue. Fitch has estimated that French banks have as much as $50 billion in exposure to Russia. On Thursday, the Dutch lender Rabobank said the sanctions could have a negative impact on some of its customers and âmay therefore also adversely affect Rabobankâs result to a limited extent.â âWe are assuming that the current trade conflict will not continue to escalate and that the climate of trust will not be further eroded,â the bank said. âShould this happen nonetheless, a weaker development of the economy in 2014 and 2015 cannot be excluded.â Rabobank also said on Thursday that net income declined 3 percent to â¬1.08 billion in the first half of the year, down from â¬1.11 billion in the first six months of 2013. The bank said its results were reduced by â¬214 million because of a nonrecurring levy on the banking sector by the Dutch government related to the nationalization of the financial institution SNS Reaal last year.
