The Buffalo Bonds? How about the Buffalo Treasury Bills? With the Buffalo Bills up for sale, Jeffrey Gundlach, a prominent bond investor in Los Angeles, is preparing a possible bid for the football team, according to reports in The Buffalo News. He is said to have partnered with Jim Kelly, the team’s Hall of Fame quarterback. Mr. Gundlach, the founder of DoubleLine Capital, grew up in a Buffalo suburb and has dreamed about buying the Bills in the past. He told The Wall Street Journal in 2011 that he was “thinking aboutâ bidding for the team as part of a group. The opportunity arose when Ralph Wilson, the founder and longtime owner of the Bills, died at age 95 in March. Mr. Wilson had wanted the team to be sold after his death. The Buffalo News, citing two unidentified sources, reported on Friday that Mr. Gundlach and Mr. Kelly had met with the trust that owns the Bills. The report said the two were hoping to join a larger bidder as minority partners. The other potential bidders in the mix are said to include some boldface names, like Jon Bon Jovi and Donald Trump, according to The News. The wealthy Pritzker family of Chicago was also said to be in talks with the trust. DealBook noticed the news after Mina Kimes, a writer at ESPN The Magazine, posted it on Twitter. The tweet inspired a few joking suggestions for a new name for the Bills. This one was inspired by Bill Gross, a rival bond investor. @MattGoldstein26 @minakimes @kevinroose The Buffalo (Not Gross) Bills â Ben Walsh (@BenDWalsh) 12 Aug 14 Another investor from Buffalo, the venture capitalist Chris Sacca, told Fortune this week that he was not interested in buying the team, citing concerns about head injuries in the N.F.L. “The head injury fallout is going to get much worse. I donât even enjoy watching knowing the trauma to those guys. So sad,â he told the magazine. Asked to comment on Mr. Gundlachâs reported interest, an analyst for DoubleLine, Loren Fleckenstein, wrote in an email: “All I can say is, ‘Go Bills!’â Advertisement
