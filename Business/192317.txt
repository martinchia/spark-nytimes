LONDON â The French conglomerate Vivendi said on Friday that it would sell its Brazilian telecommunications unit to the Spanish carrier TelefÃ³nica for 7.24 billion euros, or $9.3 billion, paving the way for Vivendi’s exit from the telecommunications business. The agreement follows a battle between TelefÃ³nica and its rival Telecom Italia, which both put forward competing bids last month for the unit, Global Village Telecom, or GVT, which operates an extensive fixed-line and broadband network across Brazil. The sale represents the latest step by Vivendi, whose holdings also include Universal Music Group and the French pay-television operator Canal Plus, to sell its telecommunications assets and focus exclusively on traditional media offerings like music and television shows. The multibillion-dollar deal allows the company to continue reducing its debt, a major focus for Arnaud de Puyfontaine, chairman of Vivendi’s management board. As part of the cash-and-share deal, TelefÃ³nica would pay â¬4.21 billion in cash, excluding debt, plus a 7.4 percent stake in TelefÃ³nicaâs Brazilian businessÂ â valued at â¬2.02 billionÂ â and a 5.7 percent stake in Telecom Italia, which is worth â¬1.01 billion. TelefÃ³nica and Telecom Italia fought over control of GVT, but the Spanish carrier remains a major shareholder of Telecom Italia through an independent holding company. By acquiring GVT, TelefÃ³nica will have a roughly 30 percent stake in Brazilâs broadband market, which analysts say will put increased pressure on AmÃ©rica MÃ³vil, its main regional rival. The Spanish carrier plans to combine the Brazilian business with its existing mobile and broadband services in the South American country, which operate under the Vivo brand. The deal is an important move for TelefÃ³nica, which has reported growth in many of its European markets. Although Brazilâs economy also has shown signs of slowing growth, the country still represents almost half of TelefÃ³nicaâs revenue from Latin America, according to the companyâs full-year earnings in 2013. Vivendi will retain a minority stake in GVT and Telecom Italia when the deal closes, but the French company has progressively sold its telecom assets in recent years. Including the GVT sale to TelefÃ³nica, the combined deals total almost $35 billion, and include the proposed sale of Vivendi’s French telecom unit, SFR, to the cable operator Numericable for around $19 billion. Vivendi also has divested its stake in Maroc Telecom for $5.7 billion and reduced its holdings in the video game company Activision Blizzard. Vivendi said the sale of its GVT assets is expected to close in the first half of next year. Advertisement
