Raj Rajaratnam and Zvi Goffer both went to trial to fight insider trading charges, and both were convicted largely on the strength of wiretap evidence.  As their sentencing dates approach later this month, they are taking almost diametrically opposed approaches in asking for sentences well below the prison terms called for by the advisory federal sentencing guidelines. For Mr. Rajaratnam, the onetime head of the Galleon Group hedge fund, the guidelines recommend a sentence of 235 to 293 months, or about 19Â½ to 24Â½ years. Meanwhile, Mr. Goffer, a former Galleon employee, is facing a potential prison term of 121 to 151 months, or about 10 to 12Â½ years.  Sentences even close to that range would be among the most severe ever imposed for insider trading. Mr. Rajaratnam and his lawyers filed a brief last week that takes an aggressive, and even defiant, tone regarding the appropriate sentence.  He argues that âthe advisory guidelines severely overstate the seriousness of the instant offenses, and would expose Mr. Rajaratnam to a sentence grossly out of proportion to the sentences imposed on other insider trading defendants.â He points out that a sentence of 20 years would exceed the average term given to defendants convicted of manslaughter, robbery, sexual abuse and child pornography.  Compared to these crimes, Mr. Rajaratnam asserts, insider trading is far less serious because it does not involve identifiable victims or any threat of physical harm. Nor has Mr. Rajaratnam expressed contrition for the trading that resulted in his convictions.  The memorandum points out that âover 99 percent of Mr. Rajaratnamâs trading activity was above suspicion, and that Galleon, far from being the den of criminality the government attempts to portray, was a well-run hedge fund.â   Mr. Rajaratnam argues for a reduced sentence because the sentencing guidelines overstate the seriousness of insider trading in a way that results in unduly severe recommended sentences.  He asserts in his brief, âone thing that insider trading does not cause are the kinds of measurable losses to identifiable victims that conventional frauds cause.â   In an interview with the United States Probation Office given in connection with preparing the presentence report for the court, prosecutors quote Mr. Rajaratnam as stating that âI am not aware of anyone who lost money as a result of my actions presented to the jury.â  By portraying insider trading as essentially a victimless crime, he hopes to persuade the court that he does not deserve the kind of punishment usually meted out to more violent criminals. In addition to challenging the application of the sentencing guidelines, Mr. Rajaratnam filed another brief asking the court to permit him to remain free on bail while he appeals the convictions.  The Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. Â§ 3143(b), directs that a defendant begin serving a prison term after sentencing, and that bail should be granted only if there is no risk of flight and the appeal âraises a substantial question of law or factâ that is likely to result in a conviction’s being reversed. The brief outlines the key issue on appeal: admission of the wiretap evidence that proved so devastating at trial.  Mr. Rajaratnam argues that Judge Richard J. Holwell of the Federal District Court in Manhattan should have suppressed the wiretaps because the governmentâs affidavit seeking authorization to listen to his telephone calls did not meet the ânecessityâ requirement imposed under the Wiretap Act.  As I discussed in an earlier post, this is Mr. Rajaratnamâs best â and perhaps only â basis to have the convictions overturned. Judge Holwell has permitted other insider trading defendants to remain free for a few weeks before reporting to federal prison to begin their terms, so I expect he will at least continue bail for Mr. Rajaratnam after the sentencing scheduled for Sept. 27. Granting bail throughout the appeal, which is likely to take at least a year, is a much closer question because it would require Judge Holwell to find that there is a reasonable chance his decision to admit the wiretaps was wrong.  Judges tend not to second-guess themselves, and Mr. Rajaratnam bears the burden of showing that the appeal has sufficient merit to permit him to delay reporting to a federal prison. Mr. Rajaratnamâs aggressive approach to the guidelines is risky because judges tend to hew fairly closely to the recommended sentence, sometimes granting a small downward adjustment but only rarely going significantly below the recommended sentence when a defendant decides to fight the charges. Two other defendants in Mr. Rajaratnamâs case, Danielle Chiesi and Mark Kurland, received sentences a few months below the guidelines range, although each entered guilty pleas and was convicted on fewer charges.  A third defendant, Robert Moffatt, received a six-month sentence, which was at the top of the recommended range.   Arguing that insider trading is not as serious as other crimes is unlikely to gain much traction with Judge Holwell.  At the sentencing hearing for Ms. Chiesi, the judge said, âThe message to Wall Street needs to be loud and clear: If you trade on inside information, you will be caught, convicted and sent to prison.â While Judge Holwell may come in below the recommended guidelines range, I think the sentence for Mr. Rajaratnam is likely to exceed 15 years, especially given that the estimated gains (and losses avoided) of more than $63 million from his insider trading far outstrip what other defendants realized.   And there is a reasonable chance it could exceed 20 years if Judge Holwell sees this as an opportunity to send a message to Wall Street. Unlike Mr. Rajaratnam, Mr. Goffer expressed great contrition for his conduct, going so far as to submit a letter to Judge Richard J. Sullivan of the Federal District Court in Manhattan stating that he would forgo his right to appeal the convictions because âthe verdict against me was just.  I am guilty.â  This is an unusual admission from a defendant who took his case to trial rather than plead guilty, which can result in a reduced sentence under the advisory guidelines for âacceptance of responsibility.â One of Mr. Gofferâs tippers, Craig Drimal, who pleaded guilty and cooperated, received a 66-month prison term from Judge Sullivan, which was within the recommended guidelines range.  Mr. Goffer played a central role in the insider trading ring he organized, gaining the moniker âOctopussyâ because of the multiple sources of information he cultivated, so it is unlikely the judge will impose a prison term below that given to Mr. Drimal. In sentencing one of Mr. Gofferâs co-defendants, Jason Goldfarb, to three years in prison, Judge Sullivan rejected pleas for leniency, pointing out that his conduct âwasnât an impulsive decision. You went on doing this for months.â Mr. Goffer may be able to impress Judge Sullivan that he truly has understood the error of his ways with his offer to waive an appeal of the conviction and sentence, although I doubt the judge will grant any significant reduction below the minimum recommended sentence of over 10 years in prison.  A message of deterrence sent to Wall Street traders seems to be uppermost in the minds of the judges who will decide the punishments for Mr. Rajaratnam and Mr. Goffer.  And that does not bode well for either defendant’s receiving much, if any, reduction in the punishment recommended by the sentencing guidelines.
