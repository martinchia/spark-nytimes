Thomson Reuters, the media and financial data company that caters to Wall Street deal makers, may be plotting some deals of its own. The company is looking to sell a group of trade publications including peHUB, Buyouts and Venture Capital Journal, according to a report by peHUB on Monday. The process is said to be at an early stage, according to the report, which cited two unidentified people. A spokesman for Thomson Reuters, Lemuel Brewster, said in an email: “As a matter of business course, Thomson Reuters routinely reviews its business portfolio in line with strategy and client needs. However, we do not comment on rumor or speculation about acquisitions or divestitures.â The three publications cover the worlds of private equity and venture capital. While peHUB is an online-only blog with an email newsletter, Buyouts and Venture Capital Journal have print magazine and Web components with annual subscription costs above $2,000. The financial news business has experienced a number of deals in the last year. In July, Forbes Media agreed to sell a majority stake to a group of Asian investors, and FINalternatives, an online publication covering hedge funds and private equity, was sold to an upstart media company. Last fall, Pearson agreed to sell Mergermarket, its deal news and data service, to a London private equity firm. On Twitter, peHUB had a playful take on the news that it reported. Feeling queasy. Just learned from myself that I’m for sale. @TRLPC puts @peHUB @Buyouts @VCJournal on block: sources //t.co/cMN2cVwPdN â pehub (@peHUB) 9 Sep 14 Advertisement
