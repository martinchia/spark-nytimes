Updated, 1:56 p.m. |  LONDON — British prosecutors have identified 22 individuals at various banks as potential co-conspirators in a wide-ranging inquiry into the manipulation of a global benchmark interest rate. The individuals were notified last week by Britainâs Serious Fraud Office that they were being investigated,   prosecutors and lawyers for some of the potential co-conspirators said at a court hearing in London on Monday. The Serious Fraud Office notified the individuals that they had been named in court papers related to criminal cases brought this year against Tom A.W. Hayes, a former Citigroup and UBS trader, and two other former brokers at RP Martin Holdings in London and that the co-conspirators’ names might be released in court as early as Monday. None of the individuals identified as co-conspirators has been charged criminally and some have yet to be interviewed by the regulator despite volunteering to do so, their lawyers said. A lawyer for at least one potential co-conspirator said his client only learned about the investigation after receiving the letter last week. Some of those identified as co-conspirators could also face charges in the United States, their lawyers said. Last week, a High Court justice, Jeremy Cooke, issued a restraining order prohibiting The Wall Street Journal and others from reporting the names of potential co-conspirators after the newspaper posted an article on its Web site on Thursday evening. British law allows judges to restrict what the media can report about a case if it might prejudice a defendant or potential jurors before a trial. On Monday, the judge lifted the injunction against The Journal, saying he didnât believe that any of the co-conspirators would be harmed at this stage because any action against them by the Serious Fraud Office would come some time in the future. But Justice Cooke didnât make the names available publicly and agreed to allow the names to be removed from indictments by prosecutors in the cases against Mr. Hayes and the other two brokers. The judge also cautioned The Journal against reporting the names again if they were obtained improperly. On Monday, Mr. Hayes, as well as the two former RP Martin brokers, Terry J. Farr and James A. Gilmour, had been expected to enter not guilty pleas to charges in the matter. That has now been put off until December, at the earliest. A trial of Mr. Hayes is now expected in January 2015. Mr. Hayes was the first person to be charged criminally in the British inquiry into the rigging of the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor. He is separately facing criminal charges in the United States. British prosecutors have said in court papers that Mr. Farr and Mr. Gilmour conspired with employees at a number of banks, including Mr. Hayes. All three men remain free on bail. The British lenders Barclays and the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Swiss bank UBS have agreed to pay a combined $2.5 billion in fines related to Libor. Last month, British and American authorities fined the British financial firm ICAP a combined $87 million for its role in the Libor manipulation. The authorities claimed that ICAP employees provided incorrect estimates that were improperly used by others to manipulate Libor in exchange for promises of meals, cash and a Ferrari. Ten ICAP employees have been caught up in the rate-rigging scandal, including three brokers facing criminal charges. The three charged criminally have left the firm and the others have left the firm or been disciplined, ICAP said. Citigroup, Deutsche Bank of Germany and other banks also remain under investigation by American and British authorities in the matter. The hearing on Monday took a bit of a bizarre turn as lawyers for the various co-conspirators stood up to argue that their clientsâ names should not be part of the public record, with several referring to their clients as âMr. Xâ or client âY.â More than a dozen barristers were in the well of the courtroom, all dressed in black robes and white wigs. Mr. Hayes, wearing a blue-gray sweater, and Mr. Farr and Ms. Gilmour, both dressed in dark-colored suits, sat behind them in a glass-enclosed room, known as colloquially as the “docks.
