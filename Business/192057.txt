Petrobras of Brazil is reportedly in talks with Eni of Italy to buy its one-third stake in the Portuguese oil company Galp for 3.5 billion euros, the Portuguese business daily Diario Economico wrote on Tuesday.  Press officers at Galp and Eni refused to comment on speculation. The Portuguese newspaper did not cite its sources in the deal talks.   Eni bought 33.3 percent of Galp in 2000 with the expectation that it would take eventual control of the company. But its plans were foiled after a regime change in the Portuguese government. Paolo Scaroni, the chief executive of Eni, has said repeatedly that the company is interested in a controlling stake, but less so in the minority share it now holds. The Portuguese conglomerate Amorim bought into Galp in 2005, and it now holds a stake equal to Eniâs.   A lock-in period for Eni, Amorim and others ended on Dec. 31, and Galp’s stock rose more than 4 percent on the next trading day. On Tuesday, shares in the company fell slightly, dipping 0.14 euros, or 0.9 percent, to 14.80 euros in afternoon trading.  The purported 3.5 billion euro ($4.7 billion) offer from Petrobras would amount to roughly 12.60 euros a share.  The market first began to re-evaluate Galp a few years ago after the Portuguese company discovered pre-salt oil deposits off the coast of Brazil. Why Petrobras, the oil company with the largest exposure to those offshore fields, would make a major payout for a small increase in its pre-salt operations is a mystery to some. Galpâs ownership has been the subject of speculation for the last couple years, as the market attempted to divine what would happen once the lock-in period ended on Dec. 31. “Itâs a fiction, like a South American telenovela,” said a person familiar with the situation, referring to speculation about deal talks. “Two lovers chase each other for years, and who knows?” Advertisement
