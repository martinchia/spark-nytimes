Eric R. Dinallo, a former New York insurance superintendent who played a role in the rescue of the American International Group, has landed a job in private practice.  Mr. Dinallo, who this year made an unsuccessful run for attorney general of New York State, is joining the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton as a partner. In a release issued Monday, the firm said that Mr. Dinallo would represent clients in financial services, providing counsel on government and internal investigations, enforcement actions, litigation and compliance matters, as well as regulation and strategy related to mergers, acquisitions and other corporate transactions. Before he was the insurance superintendent, he worked at Morgan Stanley and served as a top aide to Eliot Spitzer when he was attorney general.  âEric Dinallo brings unparalleled experience across the financial services industry, having served as New Yorkâs top insurance regulator, general counsel of a prominent insurance broker, chief of regulatory matters at a leading investment bank and a senior official in the New York State attorney general’s office,â said Martin Frederic Evans, the presiding partner of Debevoise.
