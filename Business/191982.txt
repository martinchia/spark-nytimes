12:01 p.m. | Updated  DAVOS, Switzerland–With the economy taking center stage in the U.S. presidential campaign, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner delivered an upbeat growth outlook Friday, but warned that Americaâs recovery could still be derailed by geopolitical and financial troubles abroad. The United States is likely to grow at 2 to 3 percent this year, Mr. Geithner told a large audience here at the World Economic Forum, unless Europe fails to keep a lid on its chronic sovereign debt crisis or a rise in tensions between Iran and the international community stoke global oil prices. Mr. Geithnerâs remarks came as the government reported that the U.S. economy grew at an expanded annual rate of 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter, better than the 1.8 percent rate of the third quarter but not fast enough, economists said, to stoke a meaningful recovery or help sharply reduce the nationâs high unemployment rate.  The U.S. Federal Reserve this week warned that the economy would need help for years to come, partly because Europeâs troubles, if not swiftly resolved, could undermine the nascent recovery. The central bank took the unprecedented step of announcing it would keep interest rates at near zero through late 2014 to encourage growth.  Apart from Europe, other shocks could yet emerge, including from Iran, should its confrontation with the West over the nuclear issue help stoke a rise in oil prices, Mr. Geithner said. On Thursday, Iran threatened to cut oil exports to Europe even before an embargo on Iran takes effect this summer. While fears of an outright breakup of Europeâs 17-nation monetary union have subsided, any new flareup could richochet back across the Atlantic, something that Mr. Geithner, President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidates have cited as a threat to the U.S. outlook.  But Mr. Geithner said Friday he would not object to the International Monetary Fund, whose biggest shareholder is the United States, pumping more money to the Europeans if they erect a bigger financial firewallâlike the TARP program that Washington pushed through after Lehman Brothers collapsed. That is what is needed, he said, to persuade investors that Europeâs problems can be contained. “We believe the IMF can play a more supportive, constructive role,” he said. “But it can’t be a substitute for a more effective European response.” Europe and the United States are pursuing fiscal strategies to curb a mountain of debt and cut borrowing to escape the lingering scourge of the 2008 financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis that has gripped Europe for the last two years. Washington has been more willing than the Europeans to maintain some stimulus, and the Fed has kept monetary policy looser than the European Central Bank has.  Now, the result of these policies seem to be propelling their economies toward diverging paths. The euro-zone economy is headed into its second recession in three years, while America is showing signs of climbing out of its downturn. Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, on Wednesday acknowledged that European governments need to focus more energy on reviving growth. But in a speech at Davos, she maintained that countries stricken by the sovereign debt crisis needed to continue paring debts and deficits to prevent the crisis from spreading. George Soros, the billionaire hedge fund investor, is one of many who argue that the German prescription for Europeâs troubles has done more harm than good. By imposing an orthodox austerity policy, Germany risks creating a deflationary spiral that âcould lead to a lost decadeâ in Europe, he said in Davos this week.  The accusation drew a tart retort Friday from Germanyâs stalwart finance minister, Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble. âI donât agree with George Sorosânot surprisingly,â he declared here on a stage he shared with the finance ministers of France and Spain. âIf you want to create more growth, you canât deliver this by only spending more public money. You need structural reforms.â Mr. Geithner said Europe had already made some progress in getting its problems under control, a view that seems to have replaced a stark fear, held until just a short while ago, that the euro could break apart and trigger a new paralysis in global financial markets on par with the collapse of Lehman.  âOver the last two months in particular they are laying the foundation for a more credible framework,â Mr. Geithner said of Europe. âThere have been three new governments. The ECB is doing what central banks have to do, and they are trying to strengthen the financial sector,â he said.   âItâs amazing,â Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, told the World Economic Forum shortly after Mr. Geithner climbed down from the main stage. Only a few months ago, Mr. Draghi was chiding political leaders for not doing enough. âIf you compare today to even five months ago, the euro zone is a different world,â he said.   He cautioned, though, that it may take a while before bond investors recognize the progress and that borrowing costs for countries like Italy and Spain fall. After underestimating the risk of government bonds in the years leading up to the crisis, investors âare overshooting government risk and this may go on for a while,â Mr. Draghi said. âThese things donât wash away immediately.â Continued troubles in Greece do not help. Nervousness has flared anew as Greece negotiates a deal with its international creditors to avoid defaulting on its massive debt within the next couple of months. Ollie Rehn, the European commissioner responsible for economic affairs, said Friday at Davos that a deal could be reached as early as this weekend. But that does not guarantee that Greece, whose economy is devastated amid the crisis, wonât be at defaultâs doorstep yet again in the future, or that new troubles there will not make investors worry further down the road about other weak links in Europe, including Portugal and Spain. Indeed, Mr. Geithner emphasized that the Europeans have unfinished business in creating a more credible financial firewall  to convince investors that the euro union has the wherewithal to prevent the crisis from spreading to large countries. âWithout it they will be caught in trap,â he said.   At the same time, he acknowledged that Americaâs $14 trillion economy still faces ââtremendous challengesââ of its own, hobbled by the devestation of the financial crisis. Although employers have added hundreds of thousands of jobs over the last several months, unemployment remains unacceptably high, Mr. Geithner said, the housing sector remains weak, and households still hold too much debt.  As in Europe, Americaâs high debt and deficit remain a concern. But focusing on fiscal-belt tightening at a time when the economy is struggling to recover isnât the answer, he suggested.  âOur fiscal problems are daunting, but they are more manageable than almost any other country around world,â he said. âGiven the high level of unemployment, appalingly high rates of poverty in the United States, and an erosion of peopleâs confidence in their mobility,â he said, restoring fiscal sustainability is part of the answer, âbut itâs not the dominant challenge we face as a country.â Jack Ewing contributed reporting.
