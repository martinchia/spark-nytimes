Some investors in treasury bills — the safest, lowest-yielding assets around — are getting a little nervous. On Monday afternoon a $100,000 treasury bill set to mature Oct. 24 — a week after the government will run out of money if the debt ceiling is not raised — sold for $99,820.  When that bill was issued in July, investors paid $99,991.15, expecting to cash it in Oct. 24 for $100,000. So anyone who bought a 13-week bill on July 25 and held it for 10 weeks and four days lost money. The buyers on Monday will get, assuming the government does not default, a yield to maturity of slightly under 0.2 percent. So these are not exactly distress prices. But they do reflect nervousness. There seems to be little fear that the failure to pay will last more than a few weeks. Bills maturing early next year are trading at yields about a tenth the level of the Oct. 24 bill.
