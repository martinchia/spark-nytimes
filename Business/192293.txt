A year ago, buying foreclosed homes to rent out was the sure-thing trade for investment firms backed by money from private equity companies, hedge funds and pension systems, Matthew Goldstein writes in DealBook. But now, with the supply of cheap foreclosed homes dwindling, some early investors are looking to cash out a bit by flipping homes to competitors. One such company, the Waypoint Real Estate Group, is said to be quietly shopping as many as 2,000 houses in California that it acquired in the last few years in several private investment funds. Waypoint is following other early investors like the Och-Ziff Capital Management Group and Oaktree Capital Management, which have sold homes bought near the start of the financial crisis. Other big players in the market for foreclosed homes have slowed their pace of acquisitions. Now, institutional buyers like the Blackstone Group are focusing more on fixing the properties they already own, renting them out and using the properties as collateral to back bonds that can be sold to investors. âThe single-family home market, after a wave of acquisitions by companies backed by Wall Street money, is changing as institutional buyers now focus more on expanding their operations to manage tens of thousands of homes across the United States,â Mr. Goldstein writes. âIndustry participants say that the rapid buying of foreclosed homes has ended and that they expect other early institutional buyers to sell homes to lock in profits. They say they also expect the business to consolidate into the hands of a few large companies.â  MORGAN STANLEY CHIEF GOES AGAINST TYPE Â |Â  Morgan Stanley is a very different place than it was when it nearly went under in 2008, largely because of James P. Gorman, the bankâs chief executive since 2010, Nelson D. Schwartz writes in The New York Times. âInstead of perennially playing Avis to Goldman Sachsâ Hertz in the lucrative but dangerous business of bond trading, Mr. Gorman has focused on safer ways of making money,â he writes. Now, the bankâs stockbrokers, who manage money for individual clients, contribute almost as much to the bottom line as the bankers and traders. The bank has also recovered from its clumsy management of Facebookâs initial public offering in 2012 â the companyâs stock price has since surged â to become the most sought-after underwriter of technology I.P.O.s. âThe firm is on a positive trajectory after a lot of hard knocks,â Mr. Gorman said in an interview this month. By making what Mr. Gorman called âhard decisions,â he and Morgan Stanley are âbecoming the face of what may be Wall Streetâs future: highly profitable, to be sure, but with fewer of the grand ambitions or larger-than-life personalities that have always characterized the place,â Mr. Schwartz writes.  BNP SET TO PLEAD GUILTY Â |Â  United States authorities are expected to announce a settlement with BNP Paribas on Monday in which the French bank will plead guilty to criminal charges and pay an $8.9 billion penalty, ending a widespread investigation into the bank for transferring billions of dollars on behalf of Sudan and other countries blacklisted by the United States. The board of the bank is said to have met over the weekend to give final approval to the deal, The Financial Times reports, citing unidentified people familiar with the situation. BNP is also said to have negotiated a concession with the United States authorities, who plan to impose a suspension for at least six months on the bankâs ability to process dollar denominations, a function known as dollar clearing that is essential to doing business with international clients. The authorities are said to have agreed to delay the start of the suspension period for about six months, giving the bank until January 2015 to make alternative arrangements for its clients to maintain access to United States dollar financing. Jean-Laurent Bonnafe, the chief executive of BNP, sent an internal message to employees warning them that the bank was facing stiff penalties after the United States investigation, Reuters writes. âI want to say it clearly here: we will receive a heavy penalty,â Mr. Bonnafe wrote. He added, âHowever, the difficulties that we are currently experiencing must not affect our plans for the future.â   ON THE AGENDA Â |Â  The pending home sales index is out at 10 a.m. John C.

Cohen, be sentenced next month to at least eight years in prison for insider trading, if not significantly more, Matthew Goldstein writes in DealBook. A sentence of that length would be at the upper end of prison sentences for hedge fund traders convicted of insider trading in recent years, but by no means the stiffest handed down during the long-running investigation. Prosecutors for Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, did not call for an exact sentence in a court filing on Friday but said the severity of Mr. Martomaâs crime warranted a sentence above the eight years recommended by the federal courtâs probation department. In February, a federal jury in Manhattan convicted Mr. Martoma, a married father of three young children, of helping the hedge fund generate profits and avoid losses totaling $275 million in 2008. Based on the charges on which he was convicted, Mr. Martoma could, in theory, be sentenced to as many as 20 years in prison.
