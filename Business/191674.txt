What small-business owners think. Richard Thomas got the idea to open a health food restaurant after traveling around California, where he sampled the menus of the kinds of places that were not easily found in the South in the 1980s. Later, he was further motivated when he met a nutritional consultant, Donna Gates, author of âThe Body Ecology Diet,â who told him that he had been poisoning people with his fried food. Mr. Thomas opened R. Thomas Deluxe Grill in 1985 with 48 seats, investing $528,000 and then waiting patiently for residents of Atlanta to expand their palates. He turned a small profit five years out, but only really started to make money in 1995. Today, his place has 94 seats, employs 42, is swamped on weekends — especially from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. — and generates $4 million a year in revenue. In a recent interview, Mr. Thomas, who will turn 80 in December, talked about why he continues to manage the restaurant.
