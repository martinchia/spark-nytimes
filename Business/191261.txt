The online banking start-up Simple, which seeks to distinguish itself from traditional banks by eschewing fees and offering its customers data-rich analysis of their transactions, is selling itself to a giant of European finance. BBVA, a big bank based in Madrid, said on Thursday that it had agreed to buy Simple for $117 million. The deal helps BBVA enlarge its presence in the United States, where it operates through its Compass subsidiary, and sets up Simple for expansion in this country and abroad. Simple, based in Portland, Ore., prides itself on its independent spirit, frequently criticizing the traditional banking model of which it is now becoming a part. The company was quick to emphasize, however, that its business would largely remain unchanged, operating as a separate subsidiary with the same management team. “The biggest difference from a consumer perspective is that weâre going to have significantly more resources so we can grow faster,” Josh Reich, the co-founder and chief executive, said in an interview. Simple, which offers slick apps that customers use to monitor their activity, is not a true bank, relying on Bancorp to hold customer accounts. With the BBVA deal, accounts will eventually move over to the Spanish bank, a process that would happen behind the scenes. For BBVA, acquiring Simple gives it about 100,000 new customers in the United States and technology that it hopes will help it attract more. The chairman of BBVA, Francisco GonzÃ¡lez, became intrigued in 2011 when he heard Shamir Karkal, a co-founder of Simple, give a talk criticizing banksâ technology and approach to customer service, Mr. Reich said. Mr. GonzÃ¡lez sent a handwritten note to Mr. Karkal, saying not all banks were as bad as he made them out to be, according to Mr. Reich. The start-up stayed in touch with BBVA, and talks about a deal entered a serious phase last fall, in meetings in Madrid, Mr. Reich said. Simple, which was founded in 2009, is still a niche service, though it says it is growing quickly. The company, which recently crossed the 100,000-customer mark, says it had just 19,000 customers at the beginning of 2013. It officially opened its doors for business in July 2012. “Each month itâs growing faster than the prior month. Thatâs one of the reasons why the bank was interested in us,” Mr. Reich said. Customers of Simple get a white card that can be used like a debit card, and they can take advantage of features like direct deposit and money transfers. The company does not have any physical branches, however, and it does not offer paper checkbooks. Last year, it handled more than $1.7 billion in transactions.  Though it is not profitable, Simple has broken even, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly on it. The company makes money from interchange fees when customers swipe their cards. One advantage the company has is that it gains most of its customers through word of mouth or referrals, allowing it to spend little on marketing. The start-up, which has taken $18.1 million in outside financing and is backed by venture capital firms including IA Ventures and Village Ventures, had the option of raising more money from investors, Mr. Reich said. But doing so would have “involved a degree of compromise to our vision that we thought was short-sighted,” he said. “We have, at the end of the day, a very low cost model that is revolutionary from a bank perspective but doesnât fit the short-term mindset that is common at a lot of venture capital firms,” Mr. Reich said, adding that BBVA would allow the company to continue to avoid charging fees. BBVA initially became involved with Simple through Dave McClure, an investor who backed the start-up in 2010. Mr. McClureâs fund, 500 Startups, counts BBVA as an investor, and it was through that connection that Mr. GonzÃ¡lez found himself listening to Mr. Karkal in 2011. For now, Simple plans to focus on expanding in the United States, including by moving to a bigger office and hiring more staff members. But it has ambitions to grow abroad, and it hopes the BBVA deal will assist in that effort. The start-up was advised in the deal by MergerTech, an investment banking boutique based in Emeryville, Calif., with offices in Portland.
