Nov. 16, 8:34 a.m. | Updated General Motors confirmed that it’s raising its I.P.O. price range to $32 to $33 and raising the expected proceeds from the sale of preferred stock to $4 billion from $3 billion. 4:47 p.m. | Updated  The company is also expected to raise the amount of money it expects to raise from selling preferred shares to about $4 billion from $3 billion, one of these people added. The decision to move the price range up was made on Monday afternoon, this person said, and the changes could be disclosed in a regulatory filing as soon as Tuesday morning. Books for the offering are set to close Tuesday afternoon, and G.M. shares will be priced on Wednesday. G.M.’s underwriters also expect to make use of the overallotment option, expanding the size of the offering by nearly 54.8 million shares if exercised in full, these people said. If this so-called “greenshoe” option is fully exercised, the proceeds from the stock sale could hit more than $17.6 billion using the midpoint of the price range. Several analysts have said that the current range appeared low, given G.M.’s business performance in recent quarters. People involved in the offering process said that the company and the federal government had sought a price that would attract high demand. âFortunately, things at G.M. have gone as well or better than we could expect,â Steven Rattner, the former head of the Obama administration’s auto task force, said at a conference in Detroit on Monday. âItâs clear now that this offering is going to be a huge success. Itâs clear now that demand is enormous, and itâs clear that the price will be higher rather than lower.â The roadshow for the offering is set to conclude on Wednesday after a breakneck schedule that sent company executives and bankers across the country and around the world to pitch the stock. Demand has been strong from institutional investors and sovereign wealth funds, according to the people briefed on the matter. G.M. has already secured one major cornerstone investor, agreeing to sell a 1 percent stake to SAIC Motor, one of its major partners in China, these people said. The offering could raise more than $12 billion as the company sells common and preferred stock. If nothing else, the offering will succeed in one of G.M.’s main goals: reducing the stake held by the Treasury Department to about 35 percent, down from nearly 61 percent. Cutting the Treasury’s holdings was seen as a crucial move to help G.M. shed its unwanted moniker “Government Motors,” a label the company claimed was hurting car sales. The progress at G.M., which has earned $4.2 billion in profit through the first nine months of this year, and at Chrysler means that the government can expect to recover more of the $82 billion it invested in the auto industry. Mr. Rattner estimated that the government would lose less than $10 billion and did not rule out getting back the full amount. Early projections suggested that the government would lose about $30 billion. After this weekâs offering, the Treasury Department plans to divest its stake over time, to take advantage of increases in G.M.âs share price. The Treasury would need to sell its shares at an average price of about $44 to break even. President Obama and other officials have said they want to sell off the governmentâs full stake quickly, with consideration for maximizing the return on taxpayersâ investment. âIf the government really wanted to be out in the next couple of years, it could,â Mr. Rattner said. âTwo or three more offerings and it could be out.â G.M.âs unionized workers and retirees also are benefiting from the companyâs increasing value. Mr. Rattner said a trust fund that covers health care costs for United Automobile Workers retirees could receive the full amount that G.M. was originally supposed to contribute. The trust owns 17.5 percent of G.M., after agreeing to take about half of G.M.âs $20 billion in obligations in the form of stock, and is expected to sell some of its shares in this weekâs offering.
