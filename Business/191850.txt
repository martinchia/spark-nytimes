HSBC Holdings said on Tuesday that it was in talks over the sale of its credit card business in the United States.  HSBC, the London-based bank giant, provided no further details in its statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange except to say that  “these discussions are ongoing and no decision has yet been made to proceed with any transaction.” But a person briefed on the matter told DealBook that HSBC is nearing a deal with Capital One Financial, in what would be the American company’s second major acquisition this year.  Capital One is aggressively trying to expand its plate of financial services. In June, it agreed to buy the American online banking operations of ING Group of the Netherlands for $9 billion. That takeover was meant in part to further bolster Capital One’s services beyond its traditional credit card offerings into mainline banking. Buying HSBC’s roughly $30 billion worth of credit card loans would be closer to Capital One’s core business and allow the American bank to expand its portfolio. HSBC already announced that it was considering shedding noncore consumer operations and assets as part of a $3.5 billion cost-trimming effort. Last week, the British bank announced plans to lay off 30,000 employees. It also announced that it was selling 195 bank branches, mostly in upstate New York, to the First Niagara Financial Group for about $1 billion. HSBC is being advised by JPMorgan Chase. Advertisement
