The bankruptcy of the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, with some $2.5 billion in assets, hardly would have registered on the Richter scale of troubled companies in 2009. This year itâs one of the largest â a shift that reflects the improving fortunes of the credit markets and the economy.  The mega bankruptcy boom that began during the financial crisis seems to be fading.  On Sunday, A.&P. was the 22nd company with more than $1 billion in assets to declare bankruptcy so far this year, with 99 total filings, according to New Generation Research. That’s half the amount last year when 210 publicly traded companies did so, and some 56 companies clocked in at $1 billion or more. This year has only seen one bankruptcy by a company with more than $10 billion in assets: Ambac Financial Group at $18.9 billion. In contrast, last year 14 companies that filed for Chapter 11 had assets above $10 billion, including AmTrust Financial ($11.7 billion) and General Motors ($91 billion). That companies are in less dire positions is hardly surprising. The economy has improved, if somewhat slowly. Corporate earnings are on the mend. And the credit markets are welcoming even the most troubled, giving debt-laden companies some breathing room. High-yield corporate debt issuance this year totaled $250.5 billion through last week, up 84 percent from the year before, according to Thomson Reuters. Advertisement
