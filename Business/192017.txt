Commerzbank on Wednesday reported a 1.4 billion euro operating profit for last year, beating expectations and putting it on a path to repay a significant part of the 18.2 billion euro government bailout it received in the crisis. “We want to reduce the silent participations of SoFFin significantly already in 2011,” Martin Blessing, the bank chairman, said of the German bank rescue fund, which holds about a quarter of Commerzbank. The bank’s shares fell 6 euro cents, or 0.95 percent, to 6.16 euros in Wednesday trading. Commerzbank, the second-largest lender in Germany after Deutsche Bank, returned to profitability a year earlier than initially forecast. Its 1.4 billion euro ($1.9 billion) gain stands in stark contrast to a loss of 4.54 billion euros the previous year. It reported gross annual revenue of 12.7 billion euros, 16 percent more than the 10.9 billion euros it earned in 2009, citing improvements in customer business and a general upswing in the market. Despite operating profits posted by its trading desk, its East European operations and a commercial unit that deals with midsize businesses, Commerzbank said it would not be able to pay interest on the bailout money it received from the government. By German accounting rules, it recorded a net loss of 1.2 billion for the year, largely because of a 1.9 billion euro write-down on its Eurohypo commercial real estate unit, which excludes it from paying the 1.5 billion euros of interest that it owed. The bank said the write-down stemmed from “ongoing charges in commercial real estate, and the emerging impact of the debt crisis that arose in certain European states since the beginning of 2010.” That debt crisis, Mr. Blessing said, could affect the bankâs ability to meet its schedule for repaying Germany.  But for the moment, he said the outlook was good. “For 2011, we expect to close the year with an operating profit according to I.F.R.S. that will be significantly higher than that seen in 2010,â Mr. Blessing said, referring to International Financial Reporting Standards. As part of the plan called Roadmap 2012, the bank aims to generate more than 4 billion euros in profits that year. Commerzbank is set this year to wrap up the integration of Dresdner Bank, which it bought in an ill-timed deal near the height of the financial crisis in 2008. “We are approaching the finishing line and will probably conclude the integration of the I.T. systems at Easter,” said Eric Strutz, the bankâs chief financial officer. Total integration costs are likely to come to 2.5 billion euros, slightly more than the 2.4 billion euros Commerzbank expects to save each year as a result of efficiencies. After the bailout, Commerzbank started to reduce its assets and raise its regulatory capital, with total assets declining 11 percent, to 754 billion euros, since 2009, and core Tier 1 capital increasing 13 percent, to 11.9 billion euros. Its Mittelstandsbank, which lends to midsize German companies, had its best year ever, earning 1.6 billion euros in operating profit, more than double the 602 million euros posted in 2009. The German economy grew 3.6 percent in 2010, and is projected to grow another 2.3 percent this year. Commerzbank said its private bank, which posted operating profit of 48 million euros for the year, lost 13 million euros in the fourth quarter. It has 11 million customers. The East European banking division showed a turnaround, swinging to a 53 million euro gain last year from a 393 million euro loss in 2009. Advertisement
