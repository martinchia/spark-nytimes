As many of the social structures we have relied on in the past for retirement seem to disappear or appear vulnerable (company pensions and Social Security to name two), weâre becoming increasingly more responsible for our own financial futures. But at the same time weâre overwhelmed with information about how to handle our money. Never before have we had so much information at our fingertips about how to handle money, and never before have so many of us felt out of control. Sorting though this noise is more important than ever before, not only for our financial futures but for our mental health. Think Iâm overstating the problem? In 2011, IDC Digital Universe published a study, âExtracting Value from Chaos.â It found we have 1.8 zettabytes (1.8 billion terabytes) of data floating around. What does that look like? In 2012, that number is expected to grow to 2.7 zettabytes. Obviously, itâs easy to get distracted. And based on the questions I get, people are really distracted when it comes to money. But what if instead of asking those questions, we asked just these questions: By asking these questions we switch our focus to things we have at least some control over. We start to focus on our personal economy, instead of the global economy. Our personal economy becomes the filter for all the noise. Things like Europe, the market, and individual stocks drop off our radar. Instead, we focus on information that helps us with the one thing we can control: ourselves. Obviously with so much noise, it can be incredibly hard to get this focused. But the sooner you figure out the value of this filter, the faster youâll be able to make sense of the noise. So besides burying your head in the sand, what have you done to filter the noise?   A version of this article appears in print on 10/20/2012, on page B4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Focus on the Personal Economy.
