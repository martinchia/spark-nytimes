What small-business owners think. You’re the Boss and The New York Times are participating in a LinkedIn feature called “How I Hire.” If you go to the site, you can read the thoughts of more than 80 LinkedIn “Influencers” who have written about their hiring experiences. For example, Tony Fernandes, chief executive of AirAsia Group, says he takes just 10 seconds to make a decision. Steve Blank, co-author of the “Startup Ownerâs Manual,” compares candidates with the help of a pie chart. Kevin Chou, chief executive of Kabam, devised a case-study interview as a screening exercise to try to break through the noise of the application process. In many ways,Â  looking and applying for a job isnât what it used to be. The landscape has changed significantly, with lots of new technologies and strategies available to both those who are looking to hire and those who want to be hired. With so much in flux, we asked two You’re the Boss bloggers to participate in the “How I Hire” feature by taking questions from readers. Jay Goltz, whoÂ employs more than 100 people at his five Chicago businesses, has written frequently about hiring issues for this blog. Please click here and go to the comment section to leave a question for Jay about any aspect of hiring. For those who are interested in the other side of the equation, Eilene Zimmerman, who writes about start-ups and small-business technology for You’re the Boss â and who wrote The Timesâs Career Couch column for six yearsÂ  â is taking questions from job seekers. Both Jay and Eilene will respond to a selection of questions this week. You're the Boss offers an insider's perspective on small-business ownership. It gives business owners a place where they can compare notes, ask questions, get advice, and learn from one another's mistakes. The blog also offers analysis of policy issues, and suggests investing tips.
