The pain continues at Bank of America. The beleaguered financial firm, which continues to struggle under the weight of bad mortgage assets, is planning to cut 3,500 jobs, on top of the 2,500 reductions year to date, according to an internal memo written by the company’s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan. And more could follow, with the total number of layoffs potentially reaching 10,000. “I know it is tough to have to manage through reductions, but we owe it to our customers and our shareholders to remain competitive, efficient and manage our expenses carefully,” Mr. Moynihan said in the memo.  Across Wall Street, banks have been moving to reduce expenses and headcounts, in an effort to bolster flagging profits and stock prices. Since the beginning of the year, shares of Bank of America have fallen to around $7 from $15. Amid the market turmoil in recent weeks, the bank’s performance has trailed other major financial firms like Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase as well at the Dow Jones industrial average. On that front, Mr. Moynihan remained positive in his note to employees, emphasizing that the “data coming out of the businesses show that our strategy is working.” In recent weeks, the bank has moved to sell assets like its Canadian credit card business, raising billions of dollars in the process. The firm has also settled some of the outstanding legal issues surrounding its bad mortgage assets, which were mainly picked up with the purchase of Countrywide.  “Despite the turbulence in the markets, always remember that we have the best franchise in the financial services industry and that we will get through these challenges,” Mr. Moynihan wrote. “Over time, higher net income and a rising stock price will surely follow.”
 
The Bank of America Memo:  Thank you for your ongoing leadership To: Bank of America senior leaders
As we discussed last week, this obviously is a challenging time for our company in the markets, and for our shareholders. I want to thank you for your leadership in communicating with our teammates and arming them with the material they need to be confident in our company, and to keep customers and clients well-informed and prepared. While the markets reflect many economic factors we cannot control, we must stay focused on what we can control. We have important work to do to continue putting Countrywideâs legacy mortgage issues behind us, and building the capital we will need to meet new regulatory requirements and the marketâs expectations in coming years. We are making solid progress, and this week announced another step in our capital reallocation strategy with our agreement to divest our Canada credit card business and our intent to exit the UK and Ireland consumer card businesses. There are some other actions we have taken. By now you are aware of the announcement that Ron Sturzenegger will lead Legacy Asset Servicing, as Terry Laughlin shifts to the chief risk officer role. As one of the worldâs leading commercial real estate investment bankers, Ronâs leadership ability and expertise in the business are a great fit for this role. Also, we all owe our appreciation to Paula Dominick, who performed most ably as interim chief risk officer. In addition, you are most likely hearing about ongoing position reductions taking place across the company. There will be about 3,500 reductions in the third quarter. Notifications to the affected individuals have begun, and I expect many of you are involved in helping communicate those notifications. I know it is tough to have to manage through reductions, but we owe it to our customers and our shareholders to remain competitive, efficient and manage our expenses carefully. These reductions are in addition to about 2,500 reductions we have already made, year-to-date. While the reductions this quarter are not part of New BAC, that work also is well underway as we continue to align our resources fully behind our customer-driven strategy. The management team will meet for our third and final review of ideas for change in early September. We expect to begin communicating major outcomes and next steps soon thereafter.  Despite the turbulence in the markets, always remember that we have the best franchise in the financial services industry and that we will get through these challenges. We continue to hear positive things from our customers and clients, who appreciate all we can do for them. They are choosing to do more business with us, and the data coming out of the businesses show that our strategy is working. Over time, higher net income and a rising stock price will surely follow. Our task as leaders, and key to our success, is enabling our 280,000 teammates with the tools and capabilities they need to serve customers and clients, grow relationships, build the business and put the legacy challenges behind us. New BAC will help us do that; until we get there I need you to continue to manage risk and efficiency aggressively and continue to push your teams hard on the New BAC initiatives. It is important to our strategy that we continue to organize smartly, de-layer and simplify wherever we can, and make it that much easier for our teammates to deliver the franchise to our customers and clients. I greatly appreciate all you do to lead your teams, and look forward to the results of their work increasingly shining through over the next several quarters. Advertisement
