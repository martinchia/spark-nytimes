DEVICES FUEL SUBPRIME AUTO BOOM  |  Subprime lenders are increasingly relying on technology that allows them to track and disable delinquent borrowersâ vehicles with just a tap of a smartphone app, bringing auto loans into the lives of people with low credit scores, Michael Corkery and Jessica Silver-Greenberg write as part of DealBookâs Driven Into Debt series. One mother could not get her 10-year-old daughter to an emergency room after her lender remotely activated a device in her carâs dashboard that prevented her car from starting. Another borrower contends that her lender shut her car down while she was driving on the highway. Auto loans to subprime borrowers have jumped in the last five years, fueled in part by these so-called starter interrupt devices, which allow lenders to remotely disable a carâs ignition. The devices, which have been installed in about two million vehicles, are helping feed the subprime boom by enabling more high-risk borrowers to get loans, Mr. Corkery and Ms. Silver-Greenberg write. âBy simply clicking a mouse or tapping a smartphone, lenders retain the ultimate control,â they add. âThe devices are reshaping the dynamics of auto lending by making timely payments as vital to driving a car as gasoline.â The ignition devices, which also allow lenders to track the movements of borrowers, are giving lenders peace of mind as they reach deeper into the ranks of Americans on the financial margins. But as the ignition devices have proliferated, so have complaints from troubled borrowers. Some are concerned that the devices impinge on their privacy, their dignity and their safety. âI felt like even though I made my payments and was never late under my contract, these people could do whatever they wanted,â one borrower testified, âand there was nothing I could do to stop them.â 

TRADING OPPORTUNITIES BECKON IN CHINA  |  Bankers, brokerage firms and hedge funds, including OâConnor, the $5.6 billion hedge fund owned by UBS, have been expanding their Asian operations to take advantage of the biggest opening into China in years, Alexandra Stevenson and Neil Gough write in DealBook. Through a program, called the Shanghai-Hong Kong Connect, China plans to connect the Shanghai stock exchange to its counterpart in Hong Kong over the next month as part of an initiative announced by Premier Li Keqiang this year to open Chinaâs markets to foreign investors who have been largely shut out.
With the move, foreign investors will be able to trade shares of companies listed on the Shanghai stock exchange directly for the first time, and Chinese investors will be able to buy shares in companies listed in Hong Kong. Currently, the only way for foreign investors to trade Chinese stocks is indirectly through a quota program that limits the amount of foreign money into the country. The new program will create the second-biggest equity market in the world in terms of market value of the combined listed companies, said Dawn Fitzpatrick, the chief investment officer of OâConnor. It could also create a more efficient way for investors to value Chinese companies.
Under the program, foreign and Chinese investors will have the chance to invest in hundreds of companies that were previously off limits, but they will still be limited by quotas. The combined two-way trading volume will be capped at 23.5 billion renminbi ($3.8 billion), about 20 percent of the combined average daily trading volume on both markets. Foreign buyers of Shanghai stocks will not be able to buy shares and sell them on the same day. And all trades will be settled in renminbi, introducing more risk for foreign investors.



HARVARD NAMES ENDOWMENT CHIEF  |  Harvard has appointed Stephen Blyth the next president and chief executive of Harvard Management Company, which oversees the universityâs $36.4 billion endowment, The Harvard Crimson reports. Mr. Blyth, the current head of public markets at the Harvard Management Company, will take the reins on Jan. 1, 2015, succeeding Jane L. Mendillo, who announced in June that she would step down. âMarket opportunities always evolve, and we just need to be appropriately positioned and staffed so we can identify and exploit those opportunities,â Mr. Blyth told The Crimson. 
Mr. Blyth, who led the global rates proprietary trading group at Deutsche Bank in London, also worked for Morgan Stanley before he joined the Harvard Management Company in 2006. Mr. Blyth played cricket in London growing up and has served as a faculty adviser to the Harvard Cricket Club team, according to Bloomberg News. He is also a professor of statistics and writes about finance. Harvard reported on Tuesday a 15.4 percent investment return in the year that ended June 30, trailing the three Ivy League schools that have reported returns so far.




ON THE AGENDA  |  Data on durable goods orders comes out at 8:30 a.m. Weekly jobless claims are released at 8:30 a.m. The Markit flash services purchasing managersâ index is out at 9:45 a.m. Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Atlanta Fed, gives a speech on monetary policy at 1:20 p.m. in Jackson, Miss.



I.P.O. RUNDOWN  |  Wednesday was a big day for initial public offerings, with a couple of big names making their market debuts and another pricing at the top of its range. Shares in the Citizens Financial Group, the regional retail bank spun off from the Royal Bank of Scotland, rose more than 7 percent in what was the second-biggest I.P.O. in the United States so far this year. The companyâs shares closed at $23.08 a share, valuing the company at $13 billion. 
Another market debut did not show quite the same pop. Shares of Smart & Final Stores, the warehouse-style discount supermarket chain based in Los Angeles, ended their first day of trading flat after being priced at the low end of their expected price range. The company raised $160 million in its initial stock offering late Tuesday after pricing its shares at $12 each.
The travel services company Travelport is said to have priced its initial public offering at $16 a share on Wednesday evening, the top of an expected price range. At that price, the company, which was bought for $4.3 billion in 2006 by the Blackstone Group and Technology Crossover Ventures, raised $480 million and achieved a valuation of $1.9 billion. Travelportâs shares are expected to begin trading Thursday under the symbol TVPT on the New York Stock Exchange.
