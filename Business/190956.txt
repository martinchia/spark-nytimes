The Oaktree Capital Group priced its initial public offering at $43 a share, at the bottom of the expected range for the investment giant, people briefed on the matter told DealBook on Wednesday. Oaktree’s underwriters also cut the size of the offering, to nine million shares from 10.3 million shares, said these person, who spoke on condition of anonymity. That means that the firm raised $387 million from its market debut. The pricing represents an inauspicious start for Oaktree’s new life as a public company. It is following in the footsteps of rivals like the Blackstone Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Apollo Global Management. It also raises questions about how investors will respond to the Carlyle Group, which is planning to make its own market debut in a matter of weeks. The investment giant is scheduled to begin its road show to potential shareholders next week, according to a person briefed on the firm’s plan. Founded in 1995 by six former executives of the TCW Group, Oaktree has made its name as one of the top debt investors in the industry. Based in Los Angeles, the firm manages about $74.9 billion in assets. It earned $428.4 million in adjusted net income last year, down 44 percent from 2010. Oaktree’s I.P.O. was led by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Advertisement
