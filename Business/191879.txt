Howard A. Shelanski, a longtime antitrust regulator, will join Davis Polk & Wardwell in the law firmâs Washington office. Mr. Shelanski, who has served stints as an economist at both the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission, will focus on antitrust and regulatory matters for Davis Polk clients.  He also will keep his teaching job at Georgetown Universityâs law school. “Howard is a uniquely skilled and highly respected antitrust lawyer and economist who brings valuable senior government experience to the firm,” Thomas J. Reid, Davis Polkâs managing partner, said in a statement. “He fits perfectly into our top-tier antitrust practice and our regulatory group in Washington, D.C., as we guide our clients through their most complex litigation and transactional matters.” Mr. Shelanski is Davis Polkâs latest acquisition from the regulatory world. In June, the firm hired Susan C. Ervin, who spent 15 years at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the last two years as a senior adviser at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Last year, the firm hired Michael N. Sohn, the former general counsel of the Federal Trade Commission. Mr. Shelanski began his government career in 1998 as a senior economist for Presidentâs Clintonâs Council of Economic Advisers. He then moved to the Federal Communications Commission, where he was chief economist, and later became a high-ranking economist at the F.T.C. “He is the latest in a long line of exceptionally qualified Davis Polk lawyers with senior government experience,” Mr. Reid said, “and we are pleased to welcome him to the firm.”  Advertisement
