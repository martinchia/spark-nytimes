The struggles of a business trying to survive. This is part three of a series on commissioning a new website. You can read the first part here and the second part here. I signed the contract to develop my new site with Prager Microsystems on Oct. 2, 2013. Prager’s development team came over to our shop a week later for a kickoff meeting. We agreed on a timeline for the project, with site design to be completed within 90 days. It actually happened much faster — we approved mock-ups of the new siteâs look and feel in the middle of November. The next step, creation of a working version of the site, took until the end of the year. And then I started getting requests for content. Anticipating the need for content, I had hired another employee in November, Georgia Koulas. We already had a lot of photographs on our current site, but the new site was going to require a different file size. And we hadnât added any photographs of tables my business makes to the old site since March 2012, when the thoughtless addition of a new table type and a mistake in my Google AdWords campaign nearly destroyed the company. Since then, weâve built a lot of cool tables that I wanted to show to prospective buyers. All of that adds up to a lot of grunt Photoshop work that I had no interest in doing myself. And that was just the beginning. The new site would require lots of other content beyond the photographs. One of my main objectives at the beginning of this year was to rewrite our pricing models. I started to focus on that in late January, and by March it was apparent that it was going to be a lot more complicated than I had anticipated. Not only would I have to write an extremely complicated spreadsheet that would cover the many options we offer, but I would have to load it with accurate data so the spreadsheet would generate predictions of how much time and material the construction of a new table would require.  Our systems to collect that data were also broken and needed updating. That meant more software writing for me and then a long delay while I introduced the new data-gathering regime to the shop worker and then checked to make sure that it was all working. Long story short, that kept me busy until the end of July. Through the winter and spring, Georgia was busy preparing photographs. In April, we finally had enough ready to load into the development site and get a sense of how it looked. And it looked horrible. Not the site, but the photos themselves. It wasnât Georgiaâs fault; the problem was that itâs almost impossible to get a nice photograph of our work while its in our shop. The lighting is poor, and we have columns spaced on an 18-foot grid. Many of our tables are much larger than 18 feet, so we canât get a shot without including a column. All of our old photography is bad, and it was making the new site look awful. Fortunately, thereâs another way to get a good image: by rendering a software model of the table. We prepare models for every job as part of the sales process. Using those models, we can create views of our tables that would be impossible to acquire in real life, featuring a beautifully lighted white room of infinite size for the backdrop and overhead views of even the largest tables. The downside is that it takes additional work to prepare the model for a good rendering, and generating each image takes about an hour. I did some math, and realized that it would take many months to complete the images we needed. So I bought a couple of extra computers and Sketchup licenses, and Georgia and I ran renderings all day, every day, through the summer. By August, I had both a working pricing model, which would allow me to put a number on every table in the new site, and lots of fresh images. Now I just needed to write all of the captions. That took most of September and the beginning of October. Then we completed the final quality checks. Throughout this period, my web developers were very patient. It probably helped that I kept offering to send them money — I am well aware of the cash flow implications of a job that drags on past its original completion date. Or maybe theyâre just a good crew to work with. In any case, they accommodated Georgia and me as we slowly amassed the content. The site is now complete and we recently launched it. I anticipate that we will update it frequently. Georgia will continue as a permanent employee, tasked with adding new content to the site and running our social media and email campaigns. (Iâm not sure what Iâll do with all of my free time.) The first task will be to see how customers respond to the new site and to figure out how to react if, for some reason, we stop getting inquiries.
