 Enforcers have revealed an insider trading line by stepping over it. A federal court on Wednesday threw out the convictions of two hedge fund managers, sharply narrowing the law on improper dealings. Prosecutors should expect more embarrassing reversals.The silver lining is that the ruling gives Wall Street some much-needed clarity on whatâs forbidden, and it may curb government excesses. Anthony Chiasson and Todd Newman were spared prison because of a legal nuance. They traded on data passed from Dell and Nvidia employees through intermediaries, but denied knowing whether those insiders were compensated for their tips. They argued correctly that such knowledge was an essential element of the alleged crime. Prosecutors disagreed and persuaded the trial judge to instruct the jury accordingly. The appeals court reversed, saying government lawyers had not even shown that the two men knew the origin of the information. Thatâs a big problem, the three-judge panel said, because itâs easy to imagine a âtrader who receives a tip and is unaware that his conduct was illegal.â Lack of clarity has been a chronic weakness of the laws against insider trading. They prohibit using âmaterialâ information, for example, but courts often disagree on what that term means. A breach of some duty of trust is required, but itâs not always obvious when a duty exists. Prosecutors have exploited these elastic concepts to inflict serious damage. Mr. Chiasson was sentenced to more than six years behind bars, while Mr. Newman got almost five years. Their hedge funds, Level Global Investors and Diamondback Capital Management, went out of business as a result of the charges. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney who supervised the lawsuits, has won scores of important cases against insider traders. He brought down the likes of Raj Rajaratnam, Galleon Fund’s founder, and the former McKinsey boss and Goldman Sachs director Rajat Gupta, reminding Wall Street that undermining the integrity of the markets is a serious crime. Mr. Bharara’s office, however, has overreached. Other targets like Michael Steinberg of the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors may rely on Wednesdayâs decision to overturn their own insider trading convictions. The Supreme Court said almost 80 years ago that the governmentâs interest is not in winning a case, but seeing that justice is done. The appeals court just provided a timely reminder on the active area of insider trading.
