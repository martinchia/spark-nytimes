 Duncan L. Niederauer, who provided a gateway to the public markets as head of the New York Stock Exchange, has started a new job in helping companies that want to stay private. Mr. Niederauer, who retired from the Big Board this year after its sale to IntercontinentalExchange, has joined an upstart brokerage firm called Battery East as a managing director, the firm announced early Tuesday. Battery East, which opened its doors last month, aims to help employees of privately held companies cash out of their shares through secondary sales. Mr. Niederauer, though his role will be part-time, adds a measure of credibility to the venture as well as a Rolodex of major investors. âIâm not just lending my name to it,â Mr. Niederauer said in an interview. âHaving watched what I saw for the last few years about what private companies need, I think Iâm in a position to be pretty helpful.â With more tech companies opting to delay an initial public offering, employees who own shares in those companies are often left with stock that is valuable on paper but cannot easily be sold. Complicating matters, many start-ups enforce tight restrictions on employees cashing out of their shares. A number of firms have arisen to help such employees sell their shares, but Battery East is trying to stand out by promising always to work with a companyâs management. And with roots in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street, the firm says it can find blue-chip investors to buy the employeesâ shares. Hiring Mr. Niederauer could augment the firmâs Wall Street bonafides. During his seven-year tenure at the N.Y.S.E., Mr. Niederauer attracted companies like Twitter to list on the exchange and upgraded the Big Boardâs trading technology. But the exchange also ceded its dominant position during his tenure, eventually being sold to IntercontinentalExchange in 2012. Both the N.Y.S.E. and its chief rival, Nasdaq, have entered the business of serving privately held companies. Mr. Niederauer said his new role reflected the increased options that young companies have today. âThis is about just giving companies as many choices as possible,â he said. âIt shouldnât be you have to go public over a certain period of time.â Mr. Niederauer, 55, who was a Goldman Sachs partner before joining the Big Board, said he came to Battery East through a longtime relationship with one of its founders, Michael Sobel, a former executive at the giant asset management firm BlackRock. The job, he said, allows him to remain based at home in New Jersey while traveling regularly to San Francisco, where Battery East is headquartered. He said he planned on âstaplingâ together a few more part-time jobs, though he declined to say what roles he was considering. While Battery East is focused on private companies, going public remains attractive for many young firms, Mr. Niederauer said, pointing to the strong I.P.O. market this year. âThis looks nothing like 15 years ago when almost all the I.P.O.s were from one sector,â he said. âThis has been a very, very different year.” Advertisement
