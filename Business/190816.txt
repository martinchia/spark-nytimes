12:24 a.m. | Updated  When federal regulators sued the high-flying money manager Philip A. Falcone last summer, they claimed his actions âread like the final exam in a graduate school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully.â By Thursday, the agency appeared to be softening its tone. Nearly a year after the Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of manipulating the market, using hedge fund assets to pay his own taxes and âsecretlyâ favoring select customers at the expense of others, Mr. Falcone disclosed in a public filing that he had âreached an agreement in principleâ to settle the two cases with the agency. The S.E.C. also struck a deal with Harbinger Capital Partners, Mr. Falconeâs flagship hedge fund. The settlement, which came after a federal judge in New York questioned aspects of the cases, would be a moral victory of sorts for Mr. Falcone, who has stubbornly resisted a deal for more than a year. It might also reignite concerns that the S.E.C.âs results sometimes fall short of its ambitions. The S.E.C.âs punishment of Mr. Falcone appeared steep, if only because it spelled an end to his long career as a hedge fund wizard. Mr. Falcone, who made a fortune betting against the subprime mortgage market in 2007, has agreed to at least a two-year ban from raising new capital, a death knell for a hedge fund manager. He must also âtake all actions reasonably necessary to expeditiouslyâ return money to investors who are fleeing the fund, according to the public filing on Thursday. But with the exodus of capital, and a wireless venture that he bankrolled in bankruptcy, Mr. Falconeâs hedge fund was already resigned to its fate. And the fine print of the S.E.C. deal suggests that Mr. Falcone, who is not required to admit or deny the agencyâs accusations, could escape relatively unscathed. âThe settlement, itself, would change very little in Falconeâs life,â said Erik Gordon, a professor of law and of business at the University of Michigan. For one, the deal comes with an $18 million penalty from the S.E.C. â a rounding error to a hedge fund billionaire. Mr. Falcone will personally pay $4 million of the penalty, according to people briefed on the matter, while the fundâs management company will pay the rest. One of the people briefed on the matter noted that $18 million was higher than what Mr. Falcone initially offered to pay and was a substantial sum given that the hedge fundâs investors did not suffer any financial harm. Still, the two-year ban comes with a loophole. According to the people briefed on the matter, the ban does not apply to the nine investment advisers that Mr. Falcone runs through Harbinger Capital. The S.E.C. granted the carve-out, the people said, so Mr. Falcone could unwind the hedge fund without harming investors by selling off pieces at fire-sale prices. More important, perhaps, Mr. Falcone can retain his control of the Harbinger Group, a publicly traded conglomerate that he uses to make a broad array of investments. In recent years, Mr. Falcone has started to emerge as something of a private equity investor, taking varied stakes in the insurance business and consumer goods industry, including the company that produces the George Foreman grill. That business remains largely unaffected by the S.E.C. deal. The settlement, the people said, is also notable for something that it did not include: a common provision that prohibits defendants from committing future violations with fraudulent intent. The lack of a so-called fraud injunction, an unusual victory for the target of an S.E.C. action, is a reminder of broader concerns about the toughness of the agency. During the tenure of Robert Khuzami, the former enforcement chief of the S.E.C. who filed major cases against Wall Street firms, the agency came under scrutiny for not leveling bigger fines. He notably butted heads with a federal judge in New York, Jed S. Rakoff, who in 2010 called the agencyâs $150 million settlement with Bank of America over lax public disclosures âhalf-baked justice at best.â Now that the S.E.C. is in transition under a new chairwoman, Mary Jo White, the agency is vowing once again to strike a hard line against financial fraud. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to discuss the terms of the settlement with Mr. Falcone, given that approval of the agencyâs commissioners is still required. Mr. Falcone’s lawyer, Matthew S. Dontzin, also declined to comment. The settlement emerged after earlier attempts at a deal came up short. Mr. Falcone, the people briefed on the matter said, refused to settle last year as long as the S.E.C. insisted on applying an injunction against fraud, which would amount to something of a rebuke. In June, the S.E.C. held its ground, deciding to file its cases instead. But then the S.E.C. received a warning sign from Judge Paul Crotty, who at a hearing in February declared that in one part of a case: âIâm having difficulty seeing exactly where the wrong occurred here.â Settlement talks, the people said, resumed just days later. This time, Mr. Falcone was willing to pay a larger sum. And the S.E.C. agreed to drop its bid to impose the fraud injunction. Agency officials, the people briefed on the matter said, decided that a fraud injunction in this case would be redundant. Mr. Falcone, the people said, will still have to settle charges that he committed fraud, and is prohibited from breaking the law. The S.E.C. also decided to impose an independent monitor on the firm. But the agency agreed to pick the monitor, the people said, from a list of five people Mr. Falcone recommended. âIt appears to be a pragmatic resolution of a matter in which the judge expressed some doubt about the S.E.C.âs charges,â said Stephen J. Crimmins, a partner at the law firm K&L Gates and a former enforcement official at the S.E.C. For Mr. Falcone, the deal could close a painful chapter in his long Wall Street career. There was a time when Mr. Falcone, who made his way from rural Minnesota to the Harvard hockey team, was seen as one of the savviest investors on Wall Street. His prescient bet against subprime mortgages made him the envy of the hedge fund world and led Harbingerâs assets to soar near the top of the industry. The success also thrust him and his wife, Lisa Maria, into the ranks of New Yorkâs moneyed elite. Their charitable donations, like a $10 million gift to the High Line in Manhattan, were overshadowed only by a flashy taste for fashion and real estate that made them the subject of tabloid fascination. But Mr. Falconeâs fortunes tumbled last year. A bet on LightSquared, an upstart wireless venture he sought to build from scratch, soured as the government blocked his effort to build a 4G network. A year ago, the company filed for bankruptcy, dealing a blow to Mr. Falcone, who once owned 96 percent of LightSquaredâs shares. Then the S.E.C. came bearing down on him. In June, after settlement talks broke down, the agency filed two sets of civil fraud charges against Mr. Falcone. In one case, it accused Mr. Falcone of cornering the market in a particular category of bonds. In a separate action, the S.E.C. accused Mr. Falcone of allowing three unidentified banks and investment firms â Goldman Sachs, HSBC and Paamco, according to people briefed on the matter â to withdraw money from his hedge fund when others could not. The S.E.C. also took aim at Mr. Falcone for taking a $113.2 million loan from his fund to pay his own tax bill in 2009. He borrowed the money, the S.E.C. said, at a time when the fund had blocked investor redemptions and then kept the deal secret for five months. The accusations led to an unsparing critique from the S.E.C. âNot only are hedge fund managers expected to be savvy investors, they are supposed to serve the interests of their clients,â Bruce Karpati, head of the S.E.C.âs asset management unit, said at the time. Mr. Karpati, who announced his departure from the agency on Thursday, then added: âHere, in addition to raiding a fund for personal benefit and cutting secret deals with favored investors, Falcone then lied to investors about what he had done.â A version of this article appears in print on 05/10/2013, on page B1 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Hedge Fund Manager And S.E.C.
