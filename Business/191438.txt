LONDON — Credit Suisse, the second-largest Swiss bank, will combine the support operations for its investment and private banking divisions as it looks to reduce costs against the backdrop of the sovereign debt crisis.  Starting next year, back-office functions, including trade settlement, will be brought together, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Gary Bullock, who joined the bank from UBS in 2008, will lead the new combined operation, the person added. The move is part Credit Suisse’s push to reduce annual costs by 2 billion Swiss francs ($2.1 billion) by 2013. The broad effort includes paring back the investment banking unit and eliminating 3,500 jobs worldwide. UBS is also looking to cut reduce costs by 2 billion francs over the next two years, and eliminate 3,500 job. About half of the planned layoffs are expected to come from the bankâs investment banking unit. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, both banks have struggled to reduce their exposure to risky assets and refocus on their profitable wealth management operations. The Swiss financial institutions have been aggressively finding ways to cut costs and bolster earnings. Last month, for example, Credit Suisse announced it was combining the operations of an independent subsidiary, Clariden Leu, with its other private banking units in an effort to cut overhead costs.
