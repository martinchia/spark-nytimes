Wall Street loathes change. That could explain its displeasure with the Volcker Rule.  The rule, unveiled by regulators on Tuesday, would overhaul how the banking industry carries out its trading activity. Regulators plan to limit banks from investing in hedge funds while also prohibiting proprietary trading, a major profit center where banks trade with their own money rather than for clients.   The rule is named after Paul A. Volcker, a former Federal Reserve chairman who championed a crackdown on risky trading as part of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul.   In theory, banks can easily cope with most Volcker Rule changes. In fact, they already are doing so. The nationâs biggest banks, like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, shut down their stand-alone proprietary trading desks once Dodd-Frank became law last year.  But the proposal, which spans some 300 pages, contained a few unfriendly surprises for the banks, including provisions that scrutinize how banks collect revenue, award compensation and track their compliance with the Volcker Rule. Some aspects of the proposal, financial industry lawyers and lobbyists say, challenge the very nature of Wall Street.  For one, the rule would prevent banks from doling out bonuses intended to âencourage or reward proprietary risk-taking.â  Donald Lamson, a former Treasury Department official who helped write Dodd-Frankâs section on the Volcker Rule, called the proposed compensation rule a âhugeâ change. He warned that the rule could spawn an exodus of traders from Wall Street banks to hedge funds and other lightly regulated firms.  âThis is the law of unintended consequences,â said Mr. Lamson, now a lawyer at Shearman & Sterling.  The proposal that emerged on Tuesday also requires banks to generate revenue primarily from fees and commissions rather than from the fluctuating value of securities they hold. In essence, the move would upend the banking industryâs lucrative, yet risky trading system, forcing major investment banks to resemble sleepier brokerage firms.  The revenue provision also underscores the challenge regulators face in ferreting out proprietary trading, especially when the line is blurred with legitimate client activities. Routine market-making, a practice where banks sometimes buy securities from one client with the intent of selling them to another customer, often resembles proprietary trading. By tracking a bank’s revenue, regulators aim to distinguish bona fide market-making from bets placed for the firm’s own account. So who will police how banks comply with the Volcker rule? That, too, is up to the banks.  The proposal spells out an expansive internal control regime that banks must adopt, creating layers of expensive and time-consuming compliance.  Under the rule, banks must turn over a battery of information to regulators, including nearly two-dozen metrics to gauge whether a bank is helping clients or trading for its own benefit. The American Bankers Association, a top Wall Street trade group, estimates that banks will have to spend more than six million hours putting the rule into effect.  âThe onus is absolutely on the banks,â said Kim Olson, a principal with Deloitte & Touche who is both a former regulator and banker. âThe quantitative metrics are pretty fierce.â  While the proposal stopped short of forcing bank chiefs to certify the legitimacy of their compliance program, as they must do with their accounting statements, regulators asked the public to comment on the possibility of âC.E.O. attestation.â Regulators also raised the possibility that banks might turn over their data to warehouses, where regulators could keep an eye on the trading. Such measures, analysts say, could significantly change the way Wall Street does business. Analysts also note the Volcker Ruleâs sweeping implications for foreign banks. While the rule applies only to American institutions, the exemption for foreign firms applies only to trades placed âsolely outside of the United States.â That means a foreign bank like UBS trading with, say, an American automotive company, would face scrutiny. And to be excused from the rules, a foreign bank cannot have an employee located in the United States âdirectly involvedâ in the trade.  âWhile much of the proposal is open to interpretation, we do believe the section on foreign banks appears especially onerous for foreign banks that operate proprietary trading units in New York and elsewhere in the United States,â Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst at MF Global, said in a research note.    Sullivan & Cromwell, one of the oldest Wall Street law firms, put it another way: âThe combined effect of these conditions could have a highly adverse impact not only on foreign banks, but on the position of the United States as a financial center.â  Advertisement
