Kelley Blue Book recently released its annual look at new vehicles expected to retain the greatest proportion of their original list price after five years. The information can be helpful to new car buyers who envision selling or trading in their car at some point. According to Kelley Blue Book, depreciation, or a carâs loss of value, is typically a car buyerâs primary expense during ownership, and the average car will only retain about 34 percent of its original value after five years of ownership. So which 2011 models made the cut and won Kelley Blue Bookâs best resale value award?  The top 10 models cited by Kelley Blue Book were, in alphabetical order: the Audi A5, BMW X5, BMW X6, Honda CR-V, Jeep Wrangler, Lexus GX, Lexus RX, Subaru Outback, Toyota FJ Cruiser and Toyota Tacoma. (The vehicles were analyzed with base packages and no extras.) In addition, Subaru was cited as the brand with the best resale value for 2011 and BMW was cited as the luxury brand with the best resale value. Kelley Blue Book also cited a 2011 model with the best resale value for each vehicle category. (Vehicles with prices higher than $60,000 were considered for only the luxury and high-performance category awards.) The awards were based on projections from the Kelley Blue Book resale value guide. The projections are, in turn, based on various factors, including sales data, competition within vehicle segments and expectations for the broader economy as well as the assumption that a vehicle is in average condition with 75,000 miles at the end of five years. According to Kelley Blue Book, options and packages do not necessarily increase a vehicle’s resale value, though there are some exceptions, including high-performance engines and performance packages. Do you consider such data when buying a car? Why or why not?
