The adventure of new ventures. The pitch: Software developers may not be rock stars but they are in high demand and competition for them, especially among top tech companies, is fierce. Many choose to work as freelancers, taking on short and long-term assignments for a variety of companies. These developers are often better at writing code than they are at writing contracts, negotiating fees, or communicating with clients. 10x Management represents those freelance developers much the way talent agents represent entertainers. Two of 10x Management’s co-founders, Michael Solomon and Rishon Blumberg, also own an artist management company, Brick Wall Management, that represents musical artists, theater directors and filmmakers. The idea for 10x came from the pairâs experience working with developers. In 2010 they were working on an app for one of their music clients and partnered with developers to build it. When problems arose, however, the developers didnât communicate — they simply disappeared. âEventually they came back and finished the project, but it was a horrible experience,â Mr. Solomon said. âThere needed to be a mechanism to screen these freelancers, especially for small businesses like ours, and a mediator to be able to communicate deadlines and expectations. We saw the opportunity for a traditional management model in this area.â  The new firm’s first client was Altay Guvench, a musician, developer and two-time Y Combinator alumnus who ended up joining the firm as a third co-founder. His experience was so successful that he told Mr. Solomon and Mr. Blumberg that he wanted to be their partner, not their client. Location: New York City. Employees: Six. Started: July 2012. How it works: 10x negotiates client contracts, fees and timelines for work delivery. In return, the agency takes 15 percent of the fees its clients earn. âSome clients use us just to handle the administrative functions and some use us to help with career strategy and life goals,â Mr. Solomon said. âThe biggest part of our job is to focus on customer service. By far the biggest problems we see are communication-related. So we make sure people proactively communicate with each other to avoid problems, or we intervene to avoid those problems.â Financing: 10x Management was bootstrapped by its founders. âWeâre making money,â said Mr. Solomon. âTwo years in and weâre all pulling healthy salaries.â Traction: 10x says it has 80 clients — and a waiting list of developers and data scientists who would like to sign up. Last year, its clients were paid $2.5 million. Sample client: Before he signed with 10x Management, Max Nanis, a software developer and entrepreneur in San Diego, found work on his own. He made a good living but said he spent too much time doing non-programming work like negotiating fees and deadlines and creating contracts. âI hated it,â he said. âI would anticipate a certain dollar amount for a job, and then the client would say they wouldnât pay until they got this other feature too. But they didnât understand the difficulty of implementing that feature. I donât want to have to deal with that.â Mr. Nanis said he gets better quality work and better pay at companies where he wouldnât have felt comfortable putting together a proposal. âTo get on the phone with major companies and universities or to put together a request for a proposal, I would never have been able to do.â Still, he was hesitant to sign on with 10x at first, mostly because of the 15 percent fee. “That could be $30,000 or $40,000 a year,” he said. “Thatâs a lot of money. But now I feel itâs absolutely worth it.â Challenges: Balancing supply and demand. âNow that we have a client base to meet the demand, we have to figure out how people find us. We need people to know we exist,â Mr. Solomon said. The agency has a sales person doing direct inside sales to companies that need the kind of technology talent it represents, and it has also begun doing content marketing, through a blog on the 10x website that features clients talking about their specific expertise. Another challenge is price. The firm’s clients are more expensive than a programmer you might find on, say, Craigslist, Mr. Solomon acknowledged: âIf one Ruby on Rails programmer is $100 and hour and the other is $150, you have to look at how much is accomplished in that hour. We represent people who have been vetted, are not green. These are not people who learned to program last month.” You can follow Eilene Zimmerman on Twitter.
