The activist investor Carl C. Icahn has withdrawn his lawsuit against Amylin Pharmaceuticals, helping propel the diabetes drug maker’s shares up more than 3.5 percent. But Mr. Icahn’s tersely worded announcement on Wednesday doesn’t say why. We’ll venture a guess: He was convinced that the lawsuit was unnecessary. Mr. Icahn had sued Amylin, seeking to extend the company’s deadline for nominating directors. His aim was to add additional force to his effort to push the drug maker into a sale, after it rejected a $3.5 billion takeover offer from Bristol-Myers Squibb this year. The lawsuit looked to set off yet another classic confrontation between the truculent activist and a target unwilling to bow to his whims. Until, apparently, Amylin’s chief executive shared a few words. “The decision to discontinue our lawsuit seeking to extend the director nomination deadline was the result of discussions I had with Daniel Bradbury, Amylinâs chief executive officer, that we agreed would not be publicly disclosed,” Mr. Icahn said in his statement. An Amylin spokesman had only a little more to add:  âWe are pleased that Mr. Icahn has withdrawn his lawsuit seeking to extend the director nomination deadline for our upcoming annual meeting. Amylinâs Board of Directors is fully aware of its fiduciary duties and is committed to always acting in the best interests of stockholders. The Board continually considers all options available and is relentlessly focused on creating the greatest value for our stockholders.â While the cryptic words may leave themselves open for interpretation, like a certain famous movie scene, it’s not hard to imagine what Mr. Bradbury said. Namely, that Amylin is exploring a sale of itself, just as Mr. Icahn is demanding. The company is already working with advisers — Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom — on a potential sale. While it viewed the Bristol-Myers offer as too low, Amylin is hoping to fetch a high premium, especially since its Bydureon diabetes treatment has received clearance from government regulators. The sales process is in its early stages, according to a person briefed on the matter, but it’s not inconceivable that Amylin could be sold by the end of the year. Advertisement
