TransactionPutting a price on business. Putting a price on business. Even though I was a girl, my father taught me early in life that nobody likes a wimpy handshake. As I got older, I found myself agreeing with him, especially in a business setting. While we try to decipher clues about personalities based on the firmness — or lack thereof — of someone’s grasp, studies have gone as far as linking the strength of oneâs handshake to life expectancy. But do handshake deals lead to healthy relationships in business? I moved to the southern United States (Bentonville, Ark) from Seattle in 2003 and noticed a change in social mores almost immediately. When I learned about another study that cited an overall decline in the handshake — due in large part to germ-induced fears that peak around cold and flu season — I wasnât surprised to hear that Southerners continue to shake hands with abandon. âSoutherners, known for their hospitality, traditions and manners, average about eight handshakes a week,â the study said. âThat’s two more than the national average of six handshakes a week.â  The other thing I noticed after my move was that the handshake deal seems to be alive and well. In fairness, I spent my entire professional life in Seattle ensconced in a corporate cubicle, so perhaps the handshake deal thrives in small-business communities across the country. But it surprised me to see the level at which the handshake deal can and does exist. My current location puts me within 200 miles of just about every major poultry processor in the nation. As such, my business brokerage has developed something of a niche in working with businesses that serve the meat-processing industry. We talked to a business owner in Oklahoma several years ago who was looking for an exit strategy. The company manufactured proprietary weighing and sorting equipment and had worked on the assembly lines of all of the big players in the industry. When we asked about the contracts the company had in place, we were told that there were none; business was done with a handshake. We were speechless. I admit that Iâm a bit obsessive when it comes to documentation in business, but perhaps Iâm odd in that respect. What do you think? Is there still a place in business for the handshake deal?
