Michael S. Dell’s effort of several months to buy the company that bears his name was thrown into jeopardy on Wednesday, as a special committee of the computer makerâs board refused his demand to change the voting rules on the huge buyout. Dell shareholders are set to decide the fate of the deal on Friday, absent an 11th-hour change of heart from either the board or Mr. Dell and his partner, the investment firm Silver Lake. As it currently stands, the offer of $13.65 a share, or a total of $24.4 billion, to take the company private, is likely to lose the shareholder vote, people close to both sides say. If Mr. Dell is unable to take his company private, Dell will face even fiercer competition in the already cutthroat PC business. For several months, industry analysts say, Dell has been cutting prices on the machines it sells to businesses, reducing already thin profit margins to win customers.  âThey were cutting in anticipation of going private, making advances in a high-volume, low-margin business without having to show the results,â said Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst with Gartner. âThey canât be competitive with the pressure theyâll have from Wall Street.â Dellâs two chief rivals, Hewlett-Packard and Lenovo of China, are expected to redouble their efforts to take Dellâs customers, particularly if Dell seems like a company reeling. And the companyâs board and the prospective buyers have warned that Dellâs stock could plummet into the $8 range if the deal collapses. Concerns about the dealâs prospects led to a 1.56 percent drop on Wednesday, to $12.66. Last week, Mr. Dell and Silver Lake said they would raise their proposal â in what they called their best and final offer â by 10 cents, to $13.75 a share, in exchange for the committee declaring that absentee votes would no longer count as ânoâ votes. In response, the Dell special committee told them that it would accept their offer if they withdrew their request on the voting rules change. In exchange, the board would move the vote to mid-September. That would mean moving the record date â the day by which investors must have held shares to be eligible to vote â to around Aug. 10 from June 3, letting in more shareholders interested in the deal succeeding. The Dell special committee has twice delayed a vote on the deal, originally scheduled for July 18, in an effort to buy more time to secure victory. A representative for Mr. Dell and Silver Lake declined to comment. But a person close to the two argued that they were unwilling to budge on their demand. The two have pointed to share counts showing that more than 334 million shares had not been voted. That is nearly double the expected number. With the current vote close but in favor of the deal â a recent tally showed about 579 million shares voted in favor, while 563 million against â a change could put the buyers over the top. Dellâs board and the prospective buyers have wooed investors for weeks, hoping to persuade them into accepting a deal they argue is the best path forward. By taking the 29-year-old company private, Mr. Dell and Silver Lake can shoulder the tough journey of shifting it away from personal computers into corporate software services away from the prying eyes of public markets and analysts. But the billionaire Carl C. Icahn and his main ally, Southeastern Asset Management, have fought the takeover effort. With roughly a 12.5 percent stake and Mr. Dellâs inability to vote his 16 percent stake, as well as the large number of absentee shares, the two hold enormous sway over the outcome. Mr. Dell and Silver Lake have argued that the current rules are unfair and unfairly give disproportionate power to entrenched opponents like Mr. Icahn. The Dell special committee and its advisers have argued that changing the rules midgame deserves more in return, people briefed on its deliberations said. The directors were not willing to entertain the request unless the takeover bid was raised to at least $14 a share, one of these people said. Wednesdayâs announcement put the special committee in rare alignment with Mr. Icahn and Southeastern, which have repeatedly disparaged the board as too close to Mr. Dell and unwilling to stand up for shareholders, and are seeking to replace all 11 directors. In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Icahn and Southeastern offered tepid praise for refusing to budge on the voting rules. But they again called on Dellâs directors to schedule an annual meeting and let the two sides fight over control of the company board. âIt is time to let the proposed freeze-out merger die,â the two said.
