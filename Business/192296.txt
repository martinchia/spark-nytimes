LONDON â TDC of Denmark said on Monday that it had agreed to acquire Get, a Norwegian cable provider, for about $2.2 billion. The deal would create one of Scandinaviaâs largest cable providers, serving more than 1.7 million households in Denmark and Norway. Get is Norwayâs second-largest cable and broadband services provider behind Telenor. In a news release, TDC said it would pay 13.8 billion Norwegian kroner, or about $2.2 billion, to acquire Get from Quadrangle Capital Partners and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners. Quadrangle and the Goldman Sachs private equity arm acquired Get in 2007. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Gunnar Evensen, Getâs chief executive since 2000, is expected to remain with the company and continue in his position following the closing of the transaction.  Get provides television and broadband services to about 500,000 households and businesses in Norway. The company posted revenue of 2.44 billion Norwegian kroner in 2013. “We are confident that Get has a bright future with its new partner,â Andrew Wolff, a Goldman Sachs managing director, said in a statement. TDC said it expected to issue bonds to finance the transaction. The companies expect to achieve annual costs savings of about 185 million Norwegian kroner following the deal. One of Denmark’s largest cable and broadband providers, TDC serves about 1.2 million households. The company posted revenue of 24.6 billion Danish kroner, or about $4.27 billion, in 2013. Its TDC Norway business focuses primarily on providing broadband services to large scale businesses and will combine with Get, which focuses primarily on consumers and small to medium-size businesses. JPMorgan Chase and the law firm Kromann Reumert advised TDC on the transaction, while Get was advised by Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank. Shares of TDC were down 3.3 percent to 43.06 Danish kroner in trading in Oslo on Monday morning. Advertisement
