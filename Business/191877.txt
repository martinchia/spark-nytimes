Itâs been a rough month so far, economically and financially speaking.Â  A fun, creative challenge is in order, as  a diversion from the doom and gloom. So we’re relieved that Smith Magazine is seeking âSix Words About Work,â as part of its ongoing Six-Word Memoir project. This summer, the online magazine has been running a contest on work-related topics, in partnership with human resources consulting firm Mercer. The winner in each category can win an iPad or BlackBerry PlayBook, andÂ  a chance to have their composition published in a “Six Words About Work” book. Larry Smith, the editor of Smith, says the site doesn’t usually award prizes, so he’s enjoyed calling up the winners (selected by outside judges) to inform them of their success: “I feel like Ed McMahon,” he says. Challenges have included The Best Boss I Ever Had, which elicited these submissions: • Never confused a memo with reality.
• Left me hanging out to try.
• Fired me, made me a mixtape. Also, here’s a few earlier work entries we also like: • Home office doubles as napping space.
• Short-seller. They shoot the messenger.
• Bitten. Kicked. Scratched. Veterinarian with experience. Starting this week, the final challenge of the series focuses on “Lessons learned at work.” Here’s my contribution–hardly poetic, but based on years of bitter experience: Deadlines often coincide with sick children. Do you have six words to share about some aspect of your work? Give it a try. Please share your creations here at Bucks, as well as on Smith.
