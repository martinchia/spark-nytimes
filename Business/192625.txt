Capitalizing on ChinaAn American tries to expand into China. An American tries to expand into China. If you open a business in China, you will require work space.Â But thereâs a catch: To rent or lease a space, you need a business license. And obtaining a license can take anywhere from five months to two years, depending on whether your business is in a regulated or unregulated industry. During that processing time, you will want to set up your business, hire employees and apply to the appropriate ministries for various approvals. Eventually, it becomes difficult to conduct business from your hotel or apartment, so you will want to find a small work space.Â The most common workaround is to use a service office — a space where several companies share a floor in a building that is managed by a professional rental firm. These offices typically come with furniture, phone service, Wi-Fi and some shared common areas. International companies like Regus and The Executive Centre, along with other, regional companies, offer leases that run from an hour to a year. You can rent an office with one desk or 20 desks, or even rent a virtual office that gives you an address, a phone number and a conference room as needed. Once you have your business license and are ready to hunt for leased space, you will want to hire both a real estate professional and a lawyer to review your lease. In these situations, itâs hard to navigate without the guidance of local people. Neill OâBrien, a senior manager at the commercial real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle in Shanghai, told me that for most Westerners, the biggest surprise is that prices in China are quoted on a square-meter-per-day basis. What appears at first glance to be a wonderfully affordable rate quickly begins to look outrageous if you do the right math. The other big risk is your landlord and management company. There are plenty of Chinese companies that will honor the terms of your deal, but you need a trusted professional who knows the local market to help you find them — or, even better, who can steer you toward a property that is foreign owned and managed. I know of a group of Americans who started a small restaurant. These people invested more than $110,000 to build it out and opened to great success, which continued for several months. Then they came in one morning to find a notice on the door and their locks changed. They had been released from their lease, with no warning. A week later, the landlord had a family member running the same kind of restaurant under a slightly modified name. (In the end, the restaurant, without the American-style food and service that had brought it fast fame, failed.) The restaurant owners’ lease did not really offer them protection against what occurred, which is why it is important to have a Chinese lawyer review your lease carefully. Even with a good lawyer, you risk encountering a less-then-reputable property management company. That can lead to a litigation in a Chinese court that may not even be scheduled until after your lease expires. With quality space at a premium, you should expect to pay for your own tenant improvements and build-out.Â  Generally, this will start from the studs. Most leases stipulate that at the end of the term, the tenant must pay for the complete demolition of any improvements. Typically, you will start by paying three months of rent and three months of âmanagement feesâ — an additional monthly charge that goes to the property management company — as a deposit. In addition, you must pay the first monthâs rent. On the plus side, the lease probably includes the cost of utilities. Be sure to budget time for your officeâs construction. You will be required to use construction companies approved by your landlord, and you will need to arrange inspections with the fire and building departments in your district, which can take from several weeks to three months or so to complete. Most important, whatever you do, do not go it alone. Find a good real estate professional to help you, and make sure you have a Chinese lawyer who is skilled at handling property leases. You will need them to help you find space where you can build your business confidently. Deb Weidenhamer is chief executive of Auction Systems Auctioneers & Appraisers.
