How small businesses use big data. When I started RJMetrics with my co-founder, Jake Stein, we set out to build a lean, agile company. This was easy in our early days because leanness and agility were about the only things we could afford. When your whole company is two dudes in an attic, shaping culture isnât terribly hard. As time went on, we strove to maintain the laissez-faire environment. Anything that sounded like the trappings of a big company was met with skepticism. In our minds, the word “policy” sounded like bureaucracy, and most company values sounded like empty platitudes. We had one and only one focus: acquiring customers. Which we did. And as we grew, we started to build our team. And before long, we started hitting bumps in the road. At one point, we realized that a team member who had been with us for weeks didnât know that the food in the company kitchen was there for the team. I guess we forgot to tell him on his first day. What else did we forget to tell him? As a quick fix, we wrote a list of what we called office tips to give to new team members. Then there was the time we were making a job offer to a new engineer, and she asked about our maternity leave policy. The truth was, we didnât have one. We quickly created one that was consistent with our values, and she accepted the job. âI guess we have policies now,â I said to Jake.  Soon after, we landed a big customer who required us to have a certain type of business liability insurance. On the insurance application, we had to attach our policies on discrimination, harassment and more. We were confident that smart approaches to these issues were embedded in our company DNA, but we had never written them down. So we got some language from our lawyers that aligned with our beliefs, and those became our policies. Box checked. For an embarrassingly long time, all of our new team members were handed a document that included this ragtag compilation of legalese, ad hoc policies and random office tips. The document didnât have a name, but everyone knew what it was: a dense, boring employee manual. This, of course, was precisely the kind of big-company trapping we had been trying to avoid. My rookie mistake was not realizing that, as your company grows, the best way to spend your time is a moving target. At our two-person company, writing an employee manual wouldnât have made sense. At our 70-person company, however, a better document represented an opportunity to improve communication, motivate new hires and inspire our team. It would be an extremely good use of my time, and it was long overdue. I wanted to make sure that the first thing our new team members read was directly in line with the voice and culture of our company. We threw out the old document and started with a blank page. The new document would be a true company asset that would represent who we were, how we treated one another and what we stood for. Itâs important to note that this process wasnât about changing our policies or providing the team with new information. It was about putting everything in one place, with one consistent narrative, so that new team members could hit the ground running. Our administrative team did the majority of the work, compiling assets that had already been written over the years in the form of blog posts, all-hands meetings and the old handbook. I then organized these resources into a single narrative in a single voice. All in all, it required only a few hours of my time. Below are the guidelines we followed. This Is Not an Employee Manual — Itâs a Guidebook Iâm not a fan of the word âemployee,â and âmanualâ seems uninspiring. Weâre a team, and our team members donât need an instruction manual. We thought about taking a cue from companies, like Netflix and Zappos, that famously have âculture documents,â but our document also serves as a tactical resource for navigating our office environment day to day. Our new team members are about to embark on a great adventure — so we decided to call this their guidebook. Have Your Cake and Eat It Too Yes, some of the subjects in this document are sensitive and should be approached seriously. That, however, doesnât mean the same document canât convey the fun parts of our culture as well. We decided that just because something is serious, it doesn’t mean we have to shift to legalese; instead, we added an introduction in plain English that stresses the section’s importance and explains why it was phrased so seriously. If the document is honest and engaging, these sections will carry the sensitivity and respect they deserve. The Why, What and How Sandwich The content in every section is organized in three parts: something we believe, the policy or behavior we have in place as a result and how that manifests itself in our culture. For example, when talking about paternity leave, we open by talking about the importance we place on family and our belief that new fathers should have the opportunity to spend time with their newborns. Then we state our flexible paternity leave policy, followed by some adorable photos of various office dads with their kids. While the policy is the meat of the sandwich, stating our beliefs does the important job of clarifying why the policy exists. Then the photos provide evidence that we put our money where our mouth is. Itâs Alive! This guidebook is a living document. As weâve learned, the needs of a company evolve as the company evolves. The guidebook is rarely printed out and is instead viewed as a Google Doc, and any team member can leave comments, ask questions or suggest changes. This way, everyone has access to the most up-to-date version and can always be part of the conversation. I wish I had taken a long, hard look at our old employee manual long before I did. If you havenât read yours in a while, I would recommend doing so — you might be surprised by the opportunities you find. Robert J. Moore is chief executive of RJMetrics.
