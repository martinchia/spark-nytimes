The struggles of a business trying to survive. I have bought health insurance for my workers since 1994, and since then Iâve spent well over a million dollars paying premiums. I have always found it to be troubling that I was given sole authority to make the choice as to what kind of coverage we would offer, and to a certain extent, how much it would cost. Was I doing a good job? I never heard any complaints about the policies I chose, even when I moved us into an HMO in the late ’90s, when I made my workers contribute to their plan costs in 2005, and when rates skyrocketed in the years after that. So maybe I did a good job. But my choices might have harmed both my employees and my company. Itâs very likely that I have been buying more coverage than we needed all of these years and that money that went to high premiums could have been put to better use improving our equipment, our processes, and our wages. Until this year, I never had time to fully investigate my options. And the system seemed so complex, the pricing so arbitrary, that I would just sign the quote the agent presented and move on. After all, if I didnât buy insurance for my people, they would be tossed into the individual market. They would end up paying a lot more for less coverage. And many of them wouldnât have been able to buy insurance at all. By offering coverage, I demonstrated that I cared for my people and that I wanted to run a company where they could stay and build a life for themselves and their families. Even as the price of coverage rose and rose, I kept telling myself that I needed to do the right thing, no matter what it cost. This time was different. The unfair aspects of the individual market have disappeared, eliminated by the Affordable Care Act. Plan types have been standardized, and minimum levels of care have been introduced. Pricing is more transparent than it has ever been. When my renewal packet arrived from my current insurer, with its shocking 33-percent price increase, I decided to spend some time investigating my options. And I quickly realized that the Affordable Care Act had changed the landscape in a way that would reward careful shopping. If I spent some time really digging into what the new plans consist of, and what they cost, I would be able to make a better choice. With luck, I might even find a way to lower my costs. Itâs been hard work to find the information I felt I needed to make a rational choice. And, as usual, everything I am about to tell you is based on what I, a non-expert, was able to turn up on my own. So itâs possible that Iâm entirely wrong about something. I expect commenters to chime in and set me straight. You’re the Boss would like to hear from small-business owners who are adjusting to the Affordable Care Act. First, I think it’s important to understand that a health insurance plan is essentially a bet made by insurance companies that they can predict how much a target group of subscribers will generate in medical and administrative costs — and that they can collect enough money to cover those costs. (And if they are trying to make a profit, a little bit more.) In America, we have lots of insurance companies, and they donât think that one plan should cover everyone. So, unlike many other countries, we have a dizzying number of choices. Plans are expected to cover routine care, long-term care and emergency care. That care comes from a multitude of doctors, hospitals, and other facilities. Insurers offer a variety of plans, each with a different mix of co-pays and deductibles. Before this year, a plan could have just about any configuration, and it could cover or omit different kinds of medical situations. Now the A.C.A. has mandated that each plan must have at least a minimum set of services. Insurers design lots of plans because they think this is the best way to serve people of differing needs. There are many types of plans: the most common labels for these are PPO (preferred provider organization), EPO (exclusive provider organization), POS (point of service), and HMO (health maintenance organization). Within each of those categories, there are multiple ways to charge for different kinds of costs. Ultimately, the individuals who subscribe to a plan pay for everything but some costs will be covered by the monthly premium, and the rest comes out of the pocket of the subscriber. And thatâs it: a plan is a set of rules, defining how different kinds of medical costs, in different facilities, will be split between the pot of money collected through premiums and the amount paid by the subscriber. Having configured a particular plan, the insurer will guess how many people will enroll, how much it will cost to deliver the services they use, and how much it will cost to administer, taking into account the costs of the local medical market. Thatâs a pretty complex set of calculations, and its all done a year or more before the actual costs start coming in. So insurers are going to be conservative and guess a little high. In any case, they end up with a number: the total costs to provide medical care to the members of the plan. And how do they come up with a monthly charge? That is determined by how much of the total spending number they intend to collect as premiums. The A.C.A. mandates that plans be grouped like this: for platinum level plans, members will commit to pay 90 percent of the total spending as premiums. For gold, itâs 80 percent, silver is 70 percent, and bronze is 60 percent. The rest will be collected as deductibles, co-pays, and co-insurance. Next they slice and dice that total cost number by a projection of how much of the total will be used by people of a given age. The A.C.A. mandates that the highest premium, for workers age 64 and over, be no more than three times the premium for a 21-year-old. Oh, and tobacco users pay as much as a 50-percent surcharge, depending on state law (it was 25 percent in my quotes, in Pennsylvania). When all of that actuarial fun has been completed, the result is a different monthly premium for every age plus the surcharge for tobacco users. That means there are two prices for each age in each plan — except for children under 18, who all get charged the same price. (More than three children under 18 in a family? The extras are free.) The metallic levels are a good predictor of your out-of-pocket costs, but they arenât a promise to pay some particular portion of your medical expenses each year. For instance, The Kaiser Family Foundation says this about Silver level plans: “A Silver plan has an actuarial value of 70 percent. This means that for all enrollees in a typical population, the plan will pay for 70 percent of expenses in total for covered benefits, with enrollees responsible for the rest.”  If I understand English, that does NOT mean that the plan will cover 70 percent of EACH participantâs expenses (I’ve seen that incorrect interpretation widely reported). Some of the enrollees in a given plan are going to be way more expensive than average, either because of  accidents or some kind of chronic condition. And older people are more likely than younger people to generate costs. The premium dollars are a guarantee that there is a pot of money available to cover those costs — for you and for others in the plan. Out-of-pocket costs are allocated toward the more ordinary expenses, excepting those services, like wellness check-ups, that the A.C.A. mandates will be provided at no cost. When you buy a lesser metallic level plan, you are making a bit of a bet yourself — that your total medical spending will actually be less than the projected spending for a person your age. In particular, if you are young and healthy, you might go to the doctor just for a wellness check up (covered in all plans) and maybe once or twice for a cold. That wonât cost you anywhere near your out-of-pocket maximum. With lower premiums, your total cost of coverage might be relatively low. But you lose the bet if you have an accident, get cancer, or do something else that causes you to spend up your out-of-pocket maximum. After you have hit the limit, the plan kicks in and covers the rest of the expense. But if you donât have money set aside, the out-of-pocket limits can bust you. The higher level plans offer a greater degree of certainty: you pay more in premiums but that gets you lower out-of-pocket expenses. Of course, if the plan provides more coverage than your employees actually need, your outlay is locked into high monthly premium payments, and you may not notice how much money is disappearing — money that could have been put to better use. Thereâs a peculiar psychology at work here. My employees pay 33 percent of the costs of our Gold Level HMO plan, but we have arranged with Paychex to have that money deducted from their pay checks before taxes are taken out. As a result, itâs out of sight and out of mind. And they donât write the large monthly check for the rest of the premium. So they perceive the costs of our existing plan as being relatively low — even though the total cost is many thousands of dollars per person per year. I need to make a decision about renewal by Dec. 15, in order to have coverage in place on Jan. 1. Iâm going to have to compare different plans, with different details, and different prices, and then make choices that will affect my employeeâs lives in the most intimate way. I may well recommend a plan that saves the company a lot of money, and has the potential to save the employees money, but will also require them to take much more responsibility for how they use and pay for health care. Spending the time to understand how the plans work has been useful to me. I now have a much better idea of how to move forward, and a good way to explain my choice to my people. Iâll need to prepare them for the new world of health coverage. Next: Iâll talk about what plans were offered to me and how I turned up a much larger number of choices — and a big surprise I discovered when I started to compare plan prices.
