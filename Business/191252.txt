Are you getting the most out of your business? Thirty years ago, about 30 percent of businesses started by first generations were transferred to the founders’ children. That figure, based on anecdotal evidence only, is much lower today. Some business owners have started using a structure called a family bank to finance businesses for their children. These founders realize itâs not so much a family business as a family in business. A Wealth Matters column in The Times recently discussed how a family bank works and identified some of the pitfalls. Still, many business founders do want to transfer control and ownership to their children. As an owner of a family business, as well as through my experience in working with clients, Iâve learned several rules that help pave the way for a successful transition. Make sure the business and industry are viable. Change is a constant in todayâs business environment. An industry that was once vibrant may not be in the future. When I took over our family food service and vending company, the industry was peaking. For the first 20 years that my family owned their company, the industry was growing. Vending machines that could provide high-quality food and drinks were new. There were still many available good locations that could support vending machines. But by the time I joined the company, most of the good locations already had machines. Instead of expanding the business, we spent most of our time swapping accounts with competitors. Eventually, profits were so poor that our best option was to sell our 40-year-old family business. Have your children work outside the business. Tim Berry founded Palo Alto Software, a leading provider of small-business planning software, in 1988. For almost 30 years, he was the chief executive and president. None of his children went directly into the business. One child, Sabrina Parsons, joined the company after she made her own career by first founding a software distribution company in Britain with her husband, Noah, then working as director of online marketing at Commtouch, a provider of Internet security technology. She then spent time working at Epinions and was the founder of her own Web consulting company. By the time Ms. Parsons joined Palo Alto, in 2003, she was already a seasoned executive, ready to take on real responsibilities in the family business. She had proved that she was capable and that she could receive promotions when working for someone else. Make sure your children donât start at a higher level inside the company than they had outside. When children join the family business before working at other businesses, bad things often happen. This was not the case with Ms. Parsons, who had a track record of success at the jobs she held outside her father’s business. When she joined Palo Alto, it was as the director of marketing. She was made president in April 2007, after she had proved herself in the family business doing a job similar to one she held at an outside company. Mr. Berry continues to hold the role of chairman and is active on the companyâs board of directors. Ms. Parsons is the strategic leader and chief executive of the family business. The founder needs something else to go to when itâs time to move on. Mr. Berry wanted to be out of the day-to-day operations of the company so he could spend time on other interests. He is involved in the Oregon Angel Investor community and contributes to several blogs. I often see founders become burned out. They lose interest in keeping track of and managing the details that make a company successful. Mr. Berry recruited competent management. It just happened that the person he recruited was his daughter. The founder needs to stay out of the way. One of the major adjustments for others at Palo Alto Software was learning to go to Ms. Parsons instead of Mr. Berry when problems arose or decisions needed to be made. Founders are used to answering questions when theyâre asked. Itâs important for founders to learn to redirect questions and concerns to their successor. When founders donât — and many donât — that undermines the authority of their children, who are now expected to run the company. When you transfer your business to your children, your employees wonât take you or your successor seriously until you really get out of the way. Youâll want to follow the lead of Mr. Berry. Figure out whoâs going to own stock. I believe that children who work in the business should be allowed to own stock in the business. Children who donât work in the business should not. When children who arenât working in the business own stock there, it’s almost inevitable that there will be conflicts between the children in the business and the children who arenât. Itâs really very simple. Children in the business want to reinvest capital in the business to expand it. Children who are not involved as employees want cash in the form of dividends from the business. This issue typically shows up after their parents have died. Before then, both children generally donât want to fight about cash. Children who expect to own the business should buy the business. There is an entire industry set up to transfer ownership through gifts to children. I believe this is a huge mistake. Tom Deans, in his book “Every Family’s Business,” documents why giving a business to your children is a mistake. Mr. Deans suggests that every year, two questions be answered: 1.The elder generation as sellers have to decide if they want to sell stock in the family business.
2.The junior generation as buyers have to decide if they want to buy stock in the family business. If the answer to either question is no, itâs time to set a sale of the business in motion. As an owner of a family business, do you have rules in place that your children have to follow if they join the business? What rules would you add?
