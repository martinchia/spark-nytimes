No deal. Family Dollarâs rejection of Dollar Generalâs revised $9.1 billion bid is not just a rejection of Dollar Generalâs latest offer. Family Dollar is setting up an argument that Dollar General can never satisfy the Family Dollar board. On Friday, the Family Dollar board cited the âvery real and material risk that the transaction proposed by Dollar Generalâ in unanimously rejecting the Dollar General bid. Rejection happens all the time in takeovers, but what makes this so unusual is that Family Dollar has now twice rejected a Dollar General bid that would pay more than the Dollar Tree transaction. (Dollar Tree has offered $8.5 billion.) The reason for this in both cases is the Family Dollarâs board belief that the antitrust risk posed by such a deal is too great, and that Dollar General has not done enough in its proposal to ameliorate this risk. In its first bid, Dollar General had proposed that it divest up to 750 stores. After that bid was rejected, Dollar General proposed that it would divest up to 1,500 stores and also pay Family Dollar a reverse termination fee of $500 million if the transaction was rejected by the antitrust authorities. This was not enough for Family Dollarâs board. Still, there are rejections and then there are rejections. Family Dollar and Dollar General can be seen to be bargaining right now through public proposals and rejections. In its latest rejection, Family Dollar could have taken the opportunity to detail what Dollar General would need to do to satisfy Family Dollar’s board that it had solved the antitrust risk problem. But if you read the news release, there is little to give Dollar General hope that it can do anything to satisfy the Family Dollar board. The release speaks of the need to âeliminateâ all risk. And the perceived risk here appears to be large from Family Dollar’s perspective. The news release notes that of the 20,000 stores owned by the two companies, 6,000 Family Dollar stores are within three miles of a Dollar General store. Family Dollar cites its discussions with the Federal Trade Commission over what the market is. It also tries to rebut the argument that Walmart is a natural competitor to a combined Family Dollar-Dollar General that would prevent prices from rising by stating that many overlapping stores do not have a Walmart nearby. (By the way, if you are a customer of Family Dollar, you will be less than happy to know that Family Dollar admits that its prices are higher in places where there are no Dollar General stores â another argument for why this deal would lessen competition and not go through.) Raising the ante, Dollar Tree has offered to divest an unlimited number of stores. This is an easy option for Dollar Tree because there is less overlap in Family Dollar and Dollar Tree stores, and despite the annoyingly familiar names, the two are in arguably different businesses. Dollar Tree is a true dollar store, where everything is a dollar. But Family Dollar and Dollar General are $10 or less stores where families shop for fill-in groceries and other items. Whether that truly is a distinction, it does give Dollar Tree more grounds to make the argument with the Federal Trade Commission. Even if Dollar Tree is not giving up much with its store divesting offer, it puts Dollar Tree in the position of arguing that if Dollar Generalâs bid is accepted by the Family Dollar board, Dollar General, too, must eliminate all antitrust risk. And so, we are left with a news release that appears to be saying that no deal is possible. In truth, Family Dollar is also limited in what it can say about what could work by its acquisition agreement with Dollar Tree. That agreement requires Family Dollar to endorse the Dollar Tree deal unless it finds the Dollar General proposal superior. This doesnât end the matter. Dollar General was quick to issue a news release saying it âremains committedâ to acquiring Family Dollar and is studying its ânext steps.â If Dollar General remains committed, it can offer up a true âhell or high water” provision which will commit the company to doing whatever it takes to complete the deal. This is what Dollar Tree is trying to do to goad Dollar General with its own offer to give up stores. After all, if Dollar General does offer a “hell or high water” provision, it may end up divesting thousands and thousands of stores that Dollar Tree can get cheaply. Family Dollar is happy to go along, since its shareholders will get the money no matter what. But this is tough medicine and risky for Dollar General as it may leave the retailer at the mercy of the antitrust regulators, who, knowing about the âhell or high waterâ provision, will demand huge divestitures. So absent this move or another offer in the middle, Dollar Generalâs next step then would be to take its arguments to the streets and try and get Family Dollar shareholders to reject the Dollar Tree bid. What we will see here are arguments that unfolded when Avis and Hertz got into a bidding war over Dollar Thrifty. (Yes. There are too many dollar companies out there.) In that deal, Dollar Thrifty shareholders voted against the Hertz deal while a competing Avis deal with more antitrust risk was pending. Dollar Thrifty asked its shareholders to take the easier bird in the hand bid from Hertz over the antitrust risk from Avis. Dollar Thrifty’s shareholders eventually went along, and though it took a few years, Hertz eventually acquired Dollar Thrifty. Of course, Family Dollar shareholders could be left with nothing if Dollar General is blocked by the government and Dollar Tree moves on. The momentum is on the Family Dollar side because of this and the fact that most institutional shareholders, the majority owners of Family Dollar stock, donât like to take excessive risk. Indeed, even the activist investor Carl Icahn has moved on, completely selling his stake. Still there is the Dollar Thrifty precedent. And there is the chance of forcing Dollar Tree to pay more to push the deal through. In this vein, Iâd expect Dollar General to take a half measure in the continuing dollar wars â perhaps offering up even more divestitures and if (as is likely) it doesnât convince the Family Dollar board, taking that proposal to shareholders. In this view, the Family Dollar news release is also the beginning of this battle. Family Dollar goes out of its way to outline all of the reasons it believes this deal does not make sense from an antitrust perspective. It is remarkable transparency but that will be needed if Dollar General does indeed respond. So if you are a Family Dollar shareholder, perhaps it is time to start reading up on antitrust law. You may have a hard decision to make. Advertisement
