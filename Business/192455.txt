LOOKING TO TWITTER TO REIGNITE TECH I.P.O.âS  |  Investors and deal makers are hoping that Twitterâs coming stock sale will help the market for technology initial public offerings take flight again, after a period of reduced activity in the wake of Facebookâs I.P.O., Michael J. de la Merced and David Gelles report in DealBook. About 22 technology deals have priced in 2013, about 17 percent of all I.P.O.âs this year â the lowest percentage of total initial stock sales since 2008, according to Renaissance Capital. Some of that decline occurred after Facebookâs botched offering, which was marred by technical errors. And yet, changes in the technology sector may temper any broad expansion of new stock sales. After the passage last year of the JOBS Act, businesses can also afford to be more patient, biding their time before becoming public companies. And when they do decide to go public, they can begin the process in secret, helping mask the number of would-be debutantes exploring I.P.O.âs. âI wouldnât characterize it as companies not needing to go public, but they donât feel a rush to go public,â said Cully Davis, the head of technology initial public offerings at Credit Suisse. For Twitterâs early investors and employees, an I.P.O. would offer the payday many were waiting for, Nick Bilton and Vindu Goel report in The New York Times. Dick Costolo, who is now the companyâs chief executive, could see an initial investment of $25,000 grow to more than $10 million, with additional shares he received worth many millions more. Evan Williams, a co-founder of the company who remains its largest shareholder, will almost certainly become a billionaire. Four big banks are said to have secured roles in the stock offering, Mr. Gelles reports. Goldman Sachs will take the lead role, while JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are also serving as underwriters, according to people briefed on the matter. For investors, the question will be: How much is Twitter really worth? âThe doubters are likely to be drowned out,â DealBookâs Peter Eavis writes.  

SUMMERS WITHDRAWS FROM CONSIDERATION FOR FED CHIEF  |  Lawrence H. Summers, President Obamaâs preferred candidate to lead the Federal Reserve, concluded that the White House was unlikely to overcome opposition to his candidacy from Congressional Democrats and pulled his name from consideration on Sunday, Annie Lowrey and Binyamin Appelbaum report in The New York Times. âClearly Obama couldnât bring his own most enthusiastic supporters to back him on an issue of national security,â one supporter said. âHow was he going to corral them for Larry?â
Mr. Summersâs decision was described as reluctantly made and reluctantly accepted. Though Mr. Summers wanted the job and Mr. Obama wanted to pick him, the public opposition of three Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee, the first step in the confirmation process, surprised the White House and forced a calculation that this was a battle the administration could not afford to fight, The Times writes.




A BROKERAGE FIRM THATâS PROUDLY PRIVATE  |  Sandler OâNeill, the boutique brokerage firm, âis a throwback to a different era, a vestige of a time that all but ended in 1999 when Goldman Sachsâs partners decided to take their firm public,â DealBookâs Susanne Craig writes. âAs one of the last major private partnerships on Wall Street â the other notable one is Brown Brothers Harriman â Sandler plays by different rules. Most important, it takes fewer risks than other firms. A big trading loss would have very personal implications for its 52 partners, who would have to pick up the tab.â
âIn an age of government bailouts and London Whales, Sandler may be relatively small â it has just 309 employees â but itâs also relatively untroubled. It has been fined by regulators just three times in its 25-year history, according to regulatory filings.â




ON THE AGENDA  |  Prominent investors are sharing their ideas at the Value Investing Congress in Manhattan. John Thain, the former head of Merrill Lynch who now is the chief executive of the CIT Group, is on CNBC at 10 a.m.  The bankruptcy lawyer Harvey Miller is on Bloomberg TV at 10 a.m.




ETHANOL CREDITS ON WALL STREET  |  A little-known market in ethanol credits has become âa hot new game on Wall Street,â Gretchen Morgenson and Robert Gebeloff report in The New York Times. Many people now believe that the market in ethanol credits, which the federal government created eight years ago to push refiners to use the cleaner fuel, has been exploited.
“The price of the ethanol credits skyrocketed 20-fold in just six months, according to an analysis of regulatory documents and interviews with more than 40 people involved in the market, including industry executives, brokers, traders and analysts,â The Times reports. âTraders for big banks and other financial institutions, these people say, amassed millions of the credits just as refiners were looking to buy more of them to meet an expanding federal requirement.â
