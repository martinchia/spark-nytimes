FRANKFURT â The German engineering conglomerate Siemens already makes a range of products for the American energy sector, including gas turbines and equipment for generating electricity from wind. But in acquiring the Dresser-Rand Group, a Houston-based oil services company, in a $7.6 billion deal announced Sunday night, Siemens signaled an even bigger push into the booming American sector. The deal also demonstrated how much big corporate suitors are willing to pay for companies with a strong market niche. The price tag was seen as high, especially considering that orders for Dresser-Rand’s oil and gas products and services slumped last year. But Siemens is betting that, in the long term, Dresser-Rand will strengthen its ability to cash in on unconventional drilling techniques such as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that have made the United States what Joe Kaeser, the Siemens chief executive, has called âthe place to be for oil and gas.â Mr. Kaeser acknowledged Monday that âthe price is on the high side.â But during a conference call with analysts and journalist he said the investment would pay off in the long term. âIt matters more what value is created,â he said. By DAVID GELLES A rare bright spot in the European economy in recent years, many of the biggest German companies have begun capitalizing on their strength, striking big deals for overseas competitors. Mr. Kaeser signaled the shift toward the United States in May when, as part of a larger reorganization, he hired Lisa Davis, an American and former executive at Royal Dutch Shell, to oversee Siemensâs energy-related businesses. Siemens is also moving the headquarters of its energy businesses to the United States. “They are reinforcing their oil and gas business and focusing more on the U.S. market” Julien Laurent, an oil and gas analyst at Natixis in Paris, said on Monday. With Siemensâs all-cash bid of $83 a share for Dresser-Rand, Mr. Kaeser outbid his former boss, Peter LÃ¶scher, now the chairman of Sulzer, a Swiss maker of pumps and of other equipment for the energy and chemical industries. Mr. LÃ¶scher was forced out as chief executive of Siemens last year after being held responsible for a series of problems that caused the company to miss its profit targets. Mr. Kaeser, previously the chief financial officer of Siemens, was named to replace him, and is under intense pressure to deliver better profit growth. Sulzer acknowledged last week that it was in talks with Dresser-Rand. Siemens said it expected to close the sale by the summer of next year. Siemensâ offer for Dresser-Rand’s shares is more than 20 percent above the stock market price last week. The last time Siemens made an acquisition of comparable size was in 2007 when it bought Dade Behring, a United States-based maker of medical diagnostic equipment, for about $6.4 billion. Mr. Kaeser acknowledged on Monday that the Dade Behring deal did not work out as well as planned. âWe bought a company where we really did not know what was inside,â he said. But he said that was not the case with Dresser-Rand. âWe understand this business,â he said. âItâs about compressors; itâs about turbines. Thatâs what we have been doing for years.â Siemens shares slipped on Monday, falling 0.4 percent in Frankfurt trading. The acquisition of Dresser-Rand also allows Mr. Kaeser to claim a victory after a recent defeat to its longtime rival, General Electric. Over the summer, Siemens lost out to G.E. for the energy assets being sold by the French industrial group Alstom. General Electric was also reported to be considering a bid for Dresser-Rand, but people briefed on G.E.âs plans said the company was never in serious discussions about making an offer. Still, it is clear that G.E. is also anxious to defend and expand its position in its home market. Siemens is trying to position itself as a player in the shale oil boom, which has significantly bolstered oil and gas production in the United States and is likely to lead to a sharp increase in spending on the sort of heavy oil and gas industry compressors, turbines and other equipment that Dresser supplies, analysts say. Siemens, with a market value of nearly $85 billion and sales last year of 76 billion euros, or about $97 billion, is a vastly larger company than Dresser-Rand, which had revenue of $3 billion last year. About a third of that came from the American market. Acquiring Dresser is also a promising way to cash in on the boom in extracting natural gas from shale, because the company is a major supplier of equipment for liquefied natural gas plants, which will be used to export surplus gas from North America. In addition, Dresser provides equipment for refineries and petrochemical plants, another growth business.  Another attraction for Siemens may have been that Dresser is developing some promising new products for the future. They include a small-scale unit that could be deployed near shale gas operations to supply the car and truck market with liquefied gas. Dresser is also positioning itself for the oil and gas industry’s increasing preference to place equipment on the sea floor rather than on offshore platforms by designing subsea equipment. The acquisition is another step in Siemensâ long effort to concentrate on businesses in which it has the potential to become a leading player. Last year, Siemens spun off its Osram lighting unit in an initial public offering. In a separate deal also announced Sunday, Siemens said it would sell its 50 percent stake in a household appliances joint venture to Robert Bosch for â¬3 billion. Bosch already owns the other 50 percent. The sale of the appliances business marks another retreat by Siemens as a maker of consumer goods. It previously made products such as personal computers and mobile phones, but had trouble competing with faster-moving rivals. Siemens still makes a few consumer goods, including hearing aids and home security systems. But, as the acquisition of Dresser-Rand underscores, Siemens has consistently done better in businesses where the customers are other companies or governments.
