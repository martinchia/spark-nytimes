An old-line business tries to compete in a high-tech economy. Even though we are experiencing a meltdown on one of our new production lines (as I explained in my last post), I’m still thinking about expanding our business. Iâve come to realize that one of the reasons our big and temporarily profitable expansion several years ago turned into a disaster was that I thought we had the momentum to build a growing and sustainable business. In reality, what we had was a lot of projects for customers that didnât turn into the long-term relationships we expected. The projects ran out and left us sucking wind. At first, expanding our service lines had seemed to put us in the right place at the right time, and for an entrepreneur, that is a wonderful feeling. You feel great about getting it right, about figuring it out. But it cost me a lot of money and a lot of debt service to discover that it is one thing to get it right and another to keep it right.  That is one reason I was so frustrated when I discovered, inadvertently, that we were unlikely to be able to deliver a customer’s electrical components on time and to specification. We had burned through 50 of the 60 days allotted to us to prove that we could do the work. This was not the way to make our expansion pay off. In part, I was angry with myself because it had occurred to me to question our capabilities: Is the equipment capable? Are the processes capable? Are the people trained and capable? I had some foggy idea about the importance of assessing our capabilities, but I didnât really know how to do it. I just planned to get around to it at some point. You know how it is. But burning through those 50 days forced me to confront the reality. We had hit a wall. And I was responsible for creating the wall, because I had been resisting the changes I needed to make in how I manage the company. Further, I now understood that not understanding the limitations of our system, processes, equipment and people had turned the bad luck we experienced when we chose to expand at the wrong time several years ago into really bad luck. It could even have killed us. Back then, I had thought it was all about the people, about giving them the right incentives to produce more, no matter what. I had failed to ask some important questions, including: What are employees really thinking when they walk in the door? And have we provided a reliable system for them to work in? We thought we had. We acted as if we had. In reality, what we had was a system that required a lot of special effort and firefighting, every day. So now we have no choice but to address the issues head on. We have only nine days left to figure out how to run these parts and to prove to the customer that we can do it. I called the line team into the training room. I apologized for going off on them. Nothing much was said about my apology, just some nods and people looking at the floor. I probably moved through the emotional stuff too quickly, but it was uncomfortable for me, and my rationalization was that we had to become focused on the parts. Which we did. We drew a chart of a process we use successfully on another anodizing line, one that is similar to what we think this new process should be. We ask, âWhat is the same, and what might be different about the processes?â It took 30 minutes or so for everyone to realize that this is not about them messing up but about analyzing a process and figuring out how to make it work. We drew the process chart to the best of our ability, because the drawing of process charts was fairly new to us. Weâve always been fast-moving, just-do-it types. But that approach hadnât worked over the past 50 days. The good news was that we came up with some ideas about what we needed to adjust — solution strength, run times, temperatures, etc. And the team headed off to the line to run some parts through the new process we had drawn and revised on the whiteboard to see how they work in reality. It took several hours for the results to come back — and when they did, they were not good. The parts werenât terrible, but they werenât good â not good enough, anyway. But at least we were closer than we had been in 50 days. Still, I continue to wonder, can we make it? Fred Warmbier owns Finishing Technology Inc., which is based outside of Cincinnati.
