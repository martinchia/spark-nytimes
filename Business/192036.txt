After a relationship decades long, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffet, will be taking a less active role at the Washington Post Company.  In a brief statement, the Washington Post Company announced Thursday that the billionaire investor will step down from the company’s board of directors when his term expires in May. Mr. Buffett did not provide a clear explanation for his decision, but said he would remain a resource for the company as an informal adviser.  “Iâve loved The Washington Post since I delivered almost 500,000 copies of it as a youth in Washington,” he said. “That love for the product, the company and the management continues unabated today. I will always be available to help management in any way they request. Itâs been a great 37 years.”  The Oracle of Omaha joined the board in 1974, taking an eight-year hiatus when he was the director of Capital Cities. Berkshire Hathaway remains the Washington Post Company’s largest shareholder, with a 24 percent stake, as of September 2010.  âWarren has encouraged us to continue to consult him on company matters and with the encouragement of our board, calls to the 402 area code will not be decreasing,” said Donald E. Graham, the chairman and chief executive of the Washington Post Company, referring to the area code for Omaha, Neb., where Berkshire Hathaway is based. In 2006, Mr. Buffett left the board of another major holding, Coca-Cola, after 17 years. Berkshire Hathaway is still the soda maker’s largest owner with more than 8 percent of the outstanding shares. Last month, his son, Howard G. Buffett, was elected as a director. After the announcement on Thursday, shares of the Washington Post Company dropped sharply, before stabilizing. The stock remained in positive territory in late afternoon trading, up 1 percent. The company also announced on Jan. 20 that it was increasing its annual dividend to $9.40 per share, from $9.  Although the Washington Post Company is best known for its namesake publication, the majority of its revenue come from Kaplan, its education and test preparation business. The fast-growing Kaplan, which now includes an online university, has also become a point of controversy for the company. In late 2010, the government issued new benchmarks for for-profit colleges and threatened to reduce financial aid to these institutions if certain standards were not met.  Advertisement
