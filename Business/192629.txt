LONDON â Now that the British government has successfully sold a second portion of its holdings in the Lloyds Banking Group, the question remains what to do about the Royal Bank of Scotland. During the financial crisis, the government pumped tens of billions of pounds into Lloyds and R.B.S. because the banks were weighed down by underperforming and troubled assets. In return, the government took large stakes in both banks. On Wednesday, U.K. Financial Investments, which manages the government holdings in the bailed-out banks, announced that it sold a 7.78 percent stake in Lloyds for Â£4.2 billion, or about $6.9 billion. The sale, to institutional investors for 75.5 pence a share, was a slight discount to Tuesdayâs closing price of 79.11 pence. Still, it brought a Â£105 million profit for taxpayers. Shares of Lloyds were down 3.8 percent, at 76.05 pence, in morning tradingÂ in London on Wednesday. Including a sale in September, the British government has now reduced its stake in Lloyds to 24.9 percent from about 39 percent, and done so at a profit for the public. George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, has said it is a priority to reduce the governmentâs holdings in both banks, but R.B.S. could be a much tougher sell. The government owns 81 percent of R.B.S., which is based in Edinburgh. In February, the bank announced an Â£8.2 billion annual loss and said it could be three to five more years before it recovered. âThe broad consensus is that any material reduction in the governmentâs stake in R.B.S. is a long way off,â said Keith Bowman, an equities analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown in London. In a research note after the government’s plans to sell were announced on Tuesday,Â Andrew Coombs and Ronit Ghose, two Citigroup analysts, said an additional sale to institutional investors was likely this year. The analysts also said they expected the government to sell a portion of its stake to retail investors before the elections in May 2015. After an announcement in February that R.B.S. had posted its worst annual performance since 2008, any hopes were dashed that the government would begin paring its stake in the bank anytime soon.  R.B.S. is seeking to reshape itself into a customer-friendly bank focused on the British market after years of aggressive international ambition. It is selling or spinning off noncore assets, including its Citizens Financial Group in the United States. Earlier this month, the credit rating agency Moodyâs Investors Service downgraded the R.B.S.âs long-term debt ratings, in part because of the potential risk in executing its restructuring plans. By comparison, Lloyds, which did not have the same kind of global ambitions as R.B.S., has seen its financial picture improve despite legacy issues, including legal trouble related to the sale of inappropriate loan insurance to customers. In 2013, Lloyds narrowed its loss to Â£838 million despite taking a Â£3.46 billion charge related to compensating customers for the loan insurance and other legacy issues; it posted a loss of Â£1.47 billion in 2012. Lloyds also reported a statutory profit before tax of Â£415 million, its first since 2010. Lloyds has said it will seek permission this year to begin paying a dividend to shareholders. Advertisement
