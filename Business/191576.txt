In Europe, a Conflict Over Bank Capital Â |Â  Europeâs banks and regulators are at odds about how financial institutions should increase capital reserves. Authorities want European banks to tap existing shareholders and reduce employee bonuses to find a combined $147 billion to increase their core Tier 1 ratios, a measure of a firmâs ability to weather financial shocks, to 9 percent by June. Citigroup estimates that Europeâs financial institutions, minus the Greek banks, had raised at least 40 billion euros ($51 billion) as of the fourth quarter of 2011. Banks, however, would prefer to sell or write down unprofitable operations, as well as adjust their balance sheets, to free up cash to meet the new requirements. One solution could be to increase capital reserves through rights offerings, which allow existing shareholders to buy new stock at a discount. But volatility in the financial markets as a result of Europeâs sovereign debt crisis has damped investor interest.
