The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Stifel, Nicolaus & Company on Wednesday, accusing the Midwestern brokerage firm of duping five Wisconsin school districts into buying $200 million in dubious investments.  The firm in 2006 sold the school districts âunsuitableâ securities tied to synthetic collateralized debt obligations that were âfar more riskyâ than advertised and mostly purchased with borrowed funds, according to a complaint filed in federal court in Milwaukee. Stifel and one of its former top executives, David W. Noack, concealed the perils of investing âthrough a series of falsehoods and misrepresentations,â the S.E.C. said.   The school districts had their credit ratings slashed and ultimately lost their funds, originally invested to help pay for retirement benefits for school employees. The schools, including districts in Kenosha and Whitefish Bay, borrowed $163 million to buy up the securities and chipped in $37 million of their own.   Stifel âjeopardized the ability of the school districts to fund operations and provide a quality education to students,â Robert Khuzami, the S.E.C.âs enforcement director, said in a statement. âLet this be a teaching moment for sellers of complex financial products,â he said.  Stifel said in a statement on Wednesday that it was “deeply disappointed by the misplaced action” by the S.E.C. and said it would “vigorously defend” itself. The S.E.C. is building its case around a series of potentially misleading statements that, according to the agency, induced the schools into gobbling up the risky investments.  Stifel said it would take â15 Enrons,â or a huge unforeseeable calamity, for the investments to tank, the S.E.C. said. The suit further accused Stifel of omitting crucial information when promoting the investment, including that the first batch of securities performed badly and credit rating agencies put a portion of the portfolio on “negative watch” within a few days of its closing. Stifel said in its statement that  the S.E.C. “chose to focus on isolated comments, taken out of context.” The S.E.C. also raised questions about the investments themselves, arguing that such volatile products are inappropriate for unsophisticated investors. The school districts lacked any prior experience in collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.’s, the complex securities that blew up during the credit crisis. Until then, the schools had mostly invested in certificates of deposit and other sleepy products.   âThey were clearly aware that the school districts could ill afford to bear the risk of catastrophic loss if these investments failed,â Elaine C. Greenberg, who leads the S.E.C.âs enforcement efforts in municipal securities, said in a statement.  In response, Stifel contended that the districts were “sophisticated and accredited investors” who understood the risk.  Advertisement
