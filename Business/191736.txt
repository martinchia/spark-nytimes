M&T Bank is now offering its online-banking customers access to their credit score for a monthly fee. M&T account holders can opt to pay $2.99 a month, which allows them to get their score from Equifax, one of the three major credit bureaus. The score is a true FICO score â that is, the Equifax score a lender would see if you applied for credit, said Mike Shryne, manager of alternative banking for M&T. The three-digit score, ranging from 300 to 850, combines information like your payment history, credit card balances and other factors into a snapshot of your creditworthiness. Mr. Shryne said the bank’s research showed its customers had a heightened awareness of how important oneâs credit score was to the ability to borrow, and also to monitor financial security in the age of identity theft. âYour FICO score is one of the early warning bells, of something is going wrong,â he said, such as if someone were to use your personal information to take out a loan or apply for a credit card. M&T updates the scores monthly, so the fee allows bank customers to track changes over time. (Customers can access the score as often as they wish, but it doesnât change on a daily basis.)  âIf it changes materially from one month to the next, and youâre not sure why, itâs a red light going off,â Mr. Shryne said. But if the score is so important to customers, why not offer it free? Mr. Shryne said that contrary to popular belief, banks donât have free access to their customersâ credit scores.  So part of the fee the bank charges customers is used to pay Equifax for the scores, he said. âItâs a straight fee for a straight service,â he said. âWe believe $2.99 is a fair price to ask.â At one time, the old Washington Mutual offered its credit card customers free  access to a credit score, but that service disappeared after  many of WaMu’s assets were bought by JPMorgan Chase.  A Chase spokeswoman said the bank currently had no plans to offer credit scores. One advantage to buying the score through M&T, Mr. Shryne said, is that customers donât have to worry about misleading offers on some credit score Web sites, which entice consumers with offers of free scores, but then charge them, say, $15 a month unless they then cancel the service. âMany of these free offers have hidden fees,â he said. Mr. Shyne said the credit score option was one of a menu of fee-based services the bank was introducing to help set M&T apart from its competitors.  Just last month, it made available a suite of personal finance and budgeting tools called FinanceWorks, offered at 99 cents a month. M&T has about 780 branches throughout the mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia. Would you pay $2.99 a month for “anytime access” to just one of your three FICO credit scores?
