Investors who bought into Zynga’s initial public offering last week received no respite on Monday. The online game company, which closed below its offering price on Friday, continued to slide on Monday morning. Shares of Zynga fell more than 7 percent in early trading, to less than $9 a share, about 10 percent below its offering price. But there were winners in the I.P.O.: Zynga’s underwriters, led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, collected $32.5 million in fees for the offering, the largest for an American Internet company since Google’s debut in 2004.  Morgan Stanley, which has landed many of the year’s biggest technology offerings, received $10.4 million, according to data from Standard & Poor’s. The debut, however, was not exactly a straight win for the Wall Street titan. Mutual funds managed by Morgan Stanley invested in Zynga earlier in the year at about $14 a share, or roughly 36 percent above where the stock is trading. Below is a breakdown of Zynga’s fees, according to data from Standard & Poor’s. Morgan Stanley
