LONDON â The private equity firm Advent International agreed on Tuesday to sell Domestic and General, an extended warranty company, to the private equity firm CVC Capital Partners. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but CVC Capital is understood to have paid around Â£750 million ($1.2 billion), according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. The deal is the latest sale of a company by one private equity firm to another, as other potential options like initial public offerings and disposals to corporate buyers remain difficult because of the financial crisis. So far this year, European acquisitions by private equity buyers represent 59 percent, or $26 billion, of the total combined value of deals done by private equity sellers, according to the data provider Preqin. CVC Capital will acquire Domestic and General, which Advent bought for Â£524 million in 2007 at the beginning of the financial crisis.  Domestic and General has been expanding internationally into Continental Europe, Australia and New Zealand; about a quarter of its annual revenue of Â£600 million comes from its operations outside of Britain. The company was founded in 1912 and started trading on the London Stock Exchange in 1988 before being taken private. It reported pretax earnings of Â£83 million in the 12 months ended March 31, according to a statement by Advent. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year. Goldman Sachs, Marlborough Partners and the law firm Freshfields advised Advent on the deal.
