What would you do with this business? Last week, we published a case study on Hobby Lobby International, a Brentwood, Tenn., company that makes and sells remote-controlled products, such as model airplanes and boats, and their accessories. For years, the company has been mistaken for Hobby Lobby Stores, a national art and craft supply chain with more than 600 stores. In 2012, that brand confusion escalated from a distraction to a potential liability when Hobby Lobby Stores filed a lawsuit over the Affordable Care Act provision requiring employers to provide coverage for all forms of contraception as part of employee health insurance. That case went before the Supreme Court in March, and a ruling is expected by June. Mark Cleveland, Hobby Lobby International’s owner, concluded that continuing with the status quo would have a serious impact on the growth of his company, which he had bought from a private equity firm in 2009. He took his grievance to Hobby Lobby Stores, arguing that his trademark, which predated Hobby Lobby Stores, gave him the rights to the Hobby Lobby name, as it pertains to hobby products. His ultimatum for his counterpart: Get out of the hobby business or buy the Hobby Lobby name. The larger store took the threat seriously. Late last year, Hobby Lobby Stores agreed to pay Hobby Lobby International an undisclosed amount for the Hobby Lobby brand and for intellectual assets associated with the name. And in December, Mr. Cleveland changed his company’s name to Hobby Express. He spoke recently about the resolution in an interview that has been edited and condensed.  You knew brand confusion was a risk when you bought Hobby Lobby International in 2009. Why did you go ahead with the deal anyway? My companyâs brand name pre-existed the Goliath and had trademark protection. At the time, we were operating in separate spaces, and our business was very Internet-driven while theirs was bricks and mortar. The two companies had managed to coexist, but as social media became more prominent it really started to confuse matters. And then thereÂ was a high-profile lawsuit â thatâs when their brand really began to eclipse mine. Did you come to this decision on your own, or did you get outside guidance? It took me four years to find the right attorney. I met Carter Todd in early 2013 because he happened to be a district councilman for my area. Heâd previously worked as general counsel of Gaylord Entertainment and was shocked when I told him about my story. Up until that point I couldnât find the right lawyer. I needed someone who was credible and could sit across the table from a company like Hobby Lobby Stores, but I didnât want someone who would be combative. I wanted a resolution. Meeting Carter was definitely a turning point. What happened after you drew the line in the sand? It was a series of meetings, a lot of it related to trademark law. It was also a question of how to value a 50-year-old brand and what a deal might look like. We needed to think about how customers would react and what the risk was of losing customers in the process. In the end, they were gracious to let us continue with a logo that is similar to what weâd had. We transferred all assets associated with Hobby Lobby to them. So how did you go about determining a value for the name? Hobby products are one of their revenue centers. Ultimately my position was that we had superior rights for that class. On the table was them getting out of that business, or them determining how much that name was worth to them. Did you think changing your company name was your only option, regardless of whether or not you were compensated? I never really said, “The only way out is to change my name.” That wasnât my attitude. Just because the other company is that much bigger doesnât mean I donât have a right to my name. What made you change your mind? It was when I felt they were treating me as fairly as they could, that I was sitting across the table from honorable people. At that point, the smart guy says, “Iâm going to work with them.” What was involved with changing the name? First we had to find a domain name that has provenance that doesnât have trademark restrictions. I hired a consultant and Internet marketing firm. We found seven or eight names for sale relevant to the hobby trade. I didnât want to start a brand-new website from scratch. We chose Hobby Express, and I hired someone to do nothing but work on contacting other sites to update their links to reflect our new site. The whole process was very time-consuming. Knowing what you know now, would you have still bought Hobby Lobby International? Yes. I learned more in the last five years about branding and complex business relationships than I learned most of my career. Iâd do it again, though my wife might disagree. It consumed so much of my energy. A version of this article appears in print on 05/15/2014, on page B4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Resolving Fight Over Names.
