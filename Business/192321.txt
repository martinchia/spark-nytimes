MARKETS KEEP AN EYE OUT  |  Todayâs agenda on Wall Street almost seems like it was conceived by Alfred Hitchcock. With residents of Scotland going to the polls to vote for independence, with Alibaba expected to price its huge initial public offering and with investors still puzzling over the latest pronouncement from the Federal Reserve, markets today could be in for plot twists. Stocks in Asia excluding Japan fell this morning, after the Fed raised its median estimate yesterday for where interest rates would be by the end of 2015. The Fed raised the estimate by a quarter of a percentage point, stoking concern that higher rates in the United States could lead investors to pull money from emerging markets. At the same time, the central bankâs chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, emphasized that the Fed planned to continue the mainstay of its economic stimulus campaign, keeping short-term interest rates near zero for a âconsiderable time.â Walking a tightrope, she said both that a rate increase was not imminent and that the Fed could act sooner. The timing, she said, would be determined by economic data in the coming months. European markets rose modestly this morning, but stocks in Britain were marginally lower, reflecting investorsâ nerves. The outcome of the referendum on Scottish independence will not be known until Friday morning at the soonest. Polls in Scotland opened today at 2 a.m. Eastern Time and will remain open until 5 p.m. Nearly 4.3 million residents of Scotland have registered to vote, representing 97 percent of eligible voters. Polls in recent days suggest the vote will be very close. Yet the economic consequences of a vote for independence from the United Kingdom could be profound. The pound has slumped in recent weeks and a number of banks have said they would leave an independent Scotland. More challenges would arise in the long run, as the independent nation would create a new currency and banking system. Here is a primer on some of the issues. And hereâs a guide to watching the vote. And then thereâs Alibabaâs I.P.O., which could raise up to $21.8 billion and give the Chinese e-commerce giant a valuation of $165.5 billion at the midpoint of an expected price range. With the order book significantly oversubscribed, Alibabaâs underwriters raised the fund-raising target earlier this week. But some analysts think the price could have been raised even more, suggesting a possible pop when the shares start trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. The Nasdaq Internet Index has fallen, possibly as investors make room for Alibaba in their portfolios. Not everyone is so bullish, however. Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, wrote a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission raising concerns about Alibabaâs highly complicated corporate structure.
 

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT URGES BANKS TO IMPLICATE EMPLOYEES  |  Banks hoping to avoid criminal charges should rat out their employees, Marshall L. Miller, the No. 2 official in the Justice Departmentâs criminal division, said in a speech on Wednesday, DealBookâs Ben Protess reports. He said banks would either earn credit for exposing nefarious individuals or face charges for protecting them.
âAt the risk of being a little too Brooklyn, Iâm going to be blunt: If you want full cooperation credit, make your extensive efforts to secure evidence of individual culpability the first thing you talk about when you walk in the door to make your presentationâ to the Justice Department, Mr. Miller, a former federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, said at the Global Investigation Review Program in New York. He then added: âMake those efforts the last thing you talk about before you walk out.â



ON THE AGENDA  |  Data on housing starts in August is released at 8:30 a.m. The Philadelphia Fedâs business outlook survey for September is out at 10 a.m. Thomson Reuters holds a private equity conference in Manhattan.




WHEN BROKERS SUE BACK  |  âInvestors who lose money in private placements face a new obstacle when they take their cases to arbitration before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, as they are required to do in any dispute,â Susan Antilla reports in DealBook. “The brokers they have sued are suing them back, accusing them of reneging on indemnification agreements.
âThe practice, which can intimidate investors already reeling from investment losses, is not widespread. About half of the at least two dozen scattered examples come from one brokerage firm â Berthel Fisher & Company, based in Marion, Iowa. But lawyers who represent investors say it could dissuade the public from making claims against brokers if the strategy were to catch on with other financial products.â




DATE IS SET FOR DEALBOOK CONFERENCE 2014  |  On Dec. 11, The New York Times will host its third annual DealBook conference. This year, the daylong event will be held at the new One World Trade Center. Past speakers have included Lloyd Blankfein, Jamie Dimon, Elon Musk, Preet Bharara, Eric Schmidt, Indra Nooyi, Dick Costolo, Daniel Loeb, Valerie Jarrett and many others.
