Leon Shaulov, a senior portfolio manager at the Galleon Group, was preparing for the stock market to open on Oct. 16, 2009, when word spread that the firmâs founder, the hedge fund giant Raj Rajaratnam, had been arrested on insider trading charges. In the days that followed, Mr. Shaulov and a skeleton crew of senior Galleon traders and portfolio managers worked tirelessly to unwind the hedge fundâs portfolio, jettisoning billions of dollars of stocks at fire-sale prices, ahead of what was sure to be a wave of investor redemptions that would swamp the firm. But within a week, once the fundâs portfolio was largely liquidated, its more than 100 survivors faced a stark reality: Galleon was effectively out of business. Except for a small team, employees were handed separation agreements to sign and were told by Richard Schutte, the firmâs president, that there was no need for them to come to the office anymore. Finding a job on Wall Street was tough after the financial crisis and next to impossible if your rÃ©sumÃ© included a line that said âGalleon.â As photos of Mr. Rajaratnam in handcuffs multiplied worldwide, Galleon, once considered a prized client on Wall Street because of the huge stock-trading commissions it paid, turned toxic. Even now, five years after the arrest of Mr. Rajaratnam, who is serving an 11-year sentence in a Massachusetts prison for trading on inside information, former Galleon portfolio managers and traders are reluctant to speak on the record about their efforts to rebuild their lives. Many are bitter about the experience because life after Galleon is not nearly as sweet as it was when they were at the fund. And some who worked at Galleon for only a short time are so worried about the taint that they have expunged mention of it from their rÃ©sumÃ©s. âThese are years of my life I am not getting back,â said one former Galleon portfolio manager who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the stain still associated with the Galleon name. âEven today, it impacts my professional life. A year ago, when I was going and interviewing, Galleon was a stopper.â A few Galleon portfolio managers, like Peter Swartz, who managed a small portfolio of technology stocks and had worked at other firms before joining Galleon, were able to find jobs in the industry. Mr. Swartz joined the Fortress Investment Group several months after leaving Galleon and is a portfolio manager in its Asian Macro fund. But many other Galleon executives followed the path that Mr. Shaulov took, with varying degrees of success. In 2010, Mr. Shaulov, who was a senior portfolio manager of the Galleon Buccaneerâs fund, started his own hedge fund, Maplelane Capital, with less than $50 million, mostly from his personal savings. Galleonâs sudden demise had come at a terrible time for Mr. Shaulov. He was having a strong year â Buccaneer, a short-term trading fund run by Mr. Shaulov and others, was up nearly 14 percent as of the end of September â and, like many, he was counting on a big bonus after suffering a steep drop in pay during the financial crisis. Mr. Shaulovâs portfolio had actually outperformed that of his Galleon peers in 2008, losing only 9.4 percent compared with far bigger shortfalls at the Galleon flagship technology fund managed by Mr. Rajaratnam. (Buccaneer would have eked out a 0.27 percent gain in 2008 had it not been forced to write down the assets it held at Lehman Brothers, which collapsed in September.) Mr. Shaulovâs trading prowess helped him grow. Though he started small, he now manages about $500 million in assets. He deploys the money he runs in a smattering of stocks, including Galleonâs specialty, technology stocks. Ananth Muniyappa, a Galleon trader, headed to Wall Street, even as he was being enlisted as a possible witness in the governmentâs investigation. He was on the firmâs trading desk on the afternoon of Sept. 23, 2008, when a man whom prosecutors say was Rajat K. Gupta, a Goldman Sachs director, called his friend Mr. Rajaratnam and tipped him off about an imminent investment in the firm by Warren E. Buffett. Mr. Muniyappa ended up testifying at the trial of Mr. Gupta, who was convicted of insider trading and is serving a two-year sentence.  In between preparatory meetings with prosecutors, Mr. Muniyappa  worked as a derivatives and technology sector strategist at Nomura Securities for two years. Then he struck out on his own, starting a technology company with a couple of partners called Writebot, a tool that enhances collaboration and productivity online. After more than two years at Writebot, Mr. Muniyappa told friends he is set to return to Wall Street soon. Even former Galleon executives who left before Galleon imploded did not escape unscathed. Todd Deutsch departed in 2008 and set up his own investment company, Bascom Hill Partners. But when the Galleon arrests â which included a senior McKinsey & Company partner, Anil Kumar, and an analyst, Danielle Chiesi â made headlines, Mr. Deutschâs name was drawn into the fray. After all, he had been one of the fund companyâs most successful managers, running the Captainâs Partners fund and the Captainâs Offshore fund. He was never implicated in any wrongdoing, but like almost everyone else who managed money at Galleon, he received the inevitable questions from his investors when the Galleon scandal erupted. A couple years ago, Mr. Deutsch decided to convert his hedge fund into a family office, focused on managing his personal wealth, so that he could spend more time with his children and devote his energies to pursuing business and charitable opportunities. Mr. Schutte, Galleonâs president at the time of the arrests, started a hedge fund, SpotTail Capital Advisors, and remained in Mr. Rajaratnamâs orbit. He testified for the defense in Mr. Rajaratnamâs trial, and prosecutors elicited testimony from Mr. Schutte that his hedge fund received an investment of $15 million from Mr. Rajaratnamâs family eight weeks before the trial started. The investment came after Mr. Rajaratnam gave Mr. Schutteâs fund an initial $10 million to manage months earlier. Mr. Rajaratnam subsequently withdrew part of his investment â less than $10 million â about the time he had to pay a $92.8 million penalty to the Securities and Exchange Commission but âsince then has been a net investor in the fund,â Mr. Schutte said in a statement delivered through his lawyer, Alan B. Vickery at Boies, Schiller & Flexner. Mr. Schutte said he did not ordinarily discuss any of his clients or their investments in his fund but noted he was responding because of the âunfair publicity caused by the disingenuous way the prosecutor brought out on cross-examination that $25 million had been invested by Raj Rajaratnam.â It is something that clearly rankles Mr. Schutte, even now. âEveryone â prosecutor, defense, Mr. Schutte and his counsel (us) knew about the investment before trial and had copies of the relevant documents showing it,â Mr. Vickery wrote in an email on his clientâs behalf. Mr. Schutte said that Mr. Rajaratnamâs defense lawyers had planned to bring out the $25 million investment in their direct examination but that the prosecutor successfully objected to questioning of events after Mr. Rajaratnamâs arrest. âMuch to the defenseâs surprise and Mr. Schutteâs disgust, the prosecutorâ Mr. Vickery wrote, âsomehow was permitted to bring out the post-arrest investment in Mr. Schutteâs fund on cross-examination in a highly misleading and prejudicial manner.â Reed Brodsky, the prosecutor who drew out testimony on Mr. Rajaratnamâs investment in Mr. Schutteâs fund, offered a different version of events. In court papers filed in 2012, Mr. Brodsky, who is now in private practice, wrote that the government learned of the investment only the weekend before Mr. Schutte was called as a witness by the defense. Mr. Schutte was never charged with any wrongdoing, unlike the more than 70 people who were convicted or pleaded guilty since the governmentâs crackdown on insider trading began with Galleon. Investigators cast a wide net, catching well-known Wall Street executives like Mr. Gupta. Regardless of whether they were prosecuted, âanybody involved was affected by Galleon,â said one former employee who was never charged with wrongdoing but was swept up in the early new reports about the governmentâs investigation. âOther than Leon, nobody is in a better place,â another said.
