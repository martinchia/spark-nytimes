A federal judge has unexpectedly locked up the former Goldman Sachs programmer found guilty of stealing the investment bank’s computer code. The Goldman executive, Sergey Aleynikov, had been on house arrest pending sentencing in a few weeks. But after the government warned he was a flight risk, Judge Denise L. Cote imprisoned Mr. Aleynikov, ruling that there was not “clear and convincing evidence” that he was not likely to flee the United States He is set to be sentenced on March 18. The government is pushing for Mr. Aleynikov to serve between 8 and 10 years. Mr. Aleynikov now sits in a jail cell at the Metropolitan Correction Center in Lower Manhattan. His lawyer, Kevin Marino, has filed an emergency appeal with the federal appeals court. “I ask you to just have a little mercy on him,” said Mr. Marino to the judge during last week’s hearing. “He’s not going anywhere.” In December, a jury found Mr. Aleynikov guilty of stealing Goldman’s computer code for high-frequency trading when he left the bank to join a start-up in 2009. Prosecutors depicted Mr. Aleynikov, a Russian-born immigrant, as a brazen thief who uploaded thousands of lines of source code from the firm. Mr. Marino, the lawyer for Mr. Aleynikov, called the government’s case “a silly prosecution” during the trial. He acknowledged that his client made a mistake in violating Goldman’s confidentiality policies, but insisted that he did not commit a federal crime. Judge Cote’s decision to incarcerate Mr. Aleynikov was prompted by a letter from federal prosecutors. They explained that they were unable to put Mr. Aleynikov on the “no-fly” list, although they did add him to the list of individuals who have their international reservations monitored. After the guilty verdict, Judge Cote had asked the government to explore whether there were watch lists that could ensure Mr. Aleynikov did not board an airplane. Federal prosecutors acknowledged that in the ten weeks since the guilty verdict, Mr. Aleynikov had not violated his bail conditions, which included home detention with electronic monitoring. But they told the judge that they were worried he might leave the country, given “new information about the defendant’s family circumstances.” To buttress its argument, the government said that Mr. Aleynikov is going through a divorce and “has an increasingly distant relationship with his older daughter,” visiting  “his children only on alternate weekends.” The government also said that Mr. Aleynikov’s in-laws have become less supportive, and noted that he remains close to his mother, who is returning to Russia in the coming weeks. Prosecutors also pointed out that his home is for sale. “We are concerned that these family circumstances have reduced the defendant’s ties to the community,” said the letter, which was signed by Joseph Facciponti, an assistant United States Attorney in Manhattan. Mr. Marino made an impassioned plea to let Mr. Aleynikov remain free on bail while he awaits sentencing. He offered that his client, who had already surrendered his passports, would voluntarily place himself on the “no-fly” list. Mr. Marino also explained that his client was trying to sell his home so he could pay off his debts and get his financial affairs in order before sentencing. “It’s just that at a certain level, you look at the gestalt of these things and say, is this right to put this guy in jail now?,” said Mr. Marino during last week’s hearing. “Is it necessary? Is it really?” In her ruling from the bench, Judge Cote agreed with the government and imprisoned Mr. Aleynikov. “The defendant is a dual citizen of Russia,” she said. “We have no extradition agreement with Russia that would permit us to get Mr. Aleynikov back, should he flee to Russia.” Citing Mr. Aleynikov’s separation from his wife, Judge Cote added: “His connections to his family are fraying.” During last week’s hearing, Mr. Marino mocked the government’s argument that his client’s family situation should be a factor in the judge’s determination. He said it “could not be further from the truth” that Mr. Aleynikov has diminished ties to his three young daughters, though his relationship with the oldest, a 7-year-old, is strained. “The governmentâs argument â that a 7-year-oldâs decision to side with her mom in a matrimonial dispute makes her dad a flight risk â really is as silly and sad as it sounds,” Mr. Marino wrote in a court filing. “This is not someone who should be taken away from what little contact he has now over the course of the next month, contact that is tremendously important to him as a human being with all three of his daughters, including the seven-year-old girl who is now having issues with her dad,” said Mr. Marino. Legal experts say that the government’s request was aggressive given that there are already restrictions on Mr. Aleynikov’s travel and he has not violated his bail conditions. Yet they also said it is likely the appeals court will uphold Judge Cote’s ruling. “The change of heart is a little odd, but judges have broad discretion in bail determinations and she is unlikely to be reversed,” said Stephanos Bibas, a criminal law professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a former federal prosecutor.
