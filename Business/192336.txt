Updated, 8:40 p.m. | BHP Billiton said on Tuesday that it planned to spin off several assets into a new global metals and mining company, undoing in large part the 2001 merger that created the mining giant ahead of a boom in commodities. The move heralds the end of a wave of consolidation in the industry, which was driven by Chinaâs voracious demand for minerals, as the commodities market softens and companies concentrate on their most profitable businesses. BHP Billiton said it would continue to focus on its large, long-life iron ore, copper, coal, petroleum and potash operations after the reorganization. The new company is expected to have assets in five countries and will specialize in aluminum, coal, manganese, nickel and silver. A number of the assets to be spun off had been acquired by BHP as part of the merger with Billiton. âWe believe the proposed demerger, if implemented, will accelerate the simplification of the groupâs portfolio, provide investors with choice and unlock value in both companies,â Jacques A. Nasser, BHP Billitonâs chairman, said in a statement. Investors, however, did not react positively to the news. The announced demerger was generally in line with market expectation, and some investors had hoped that the company would also announce a share buyback of about $3 billion, analysts said. Shares of BHP Billiton declined nearly 5 percent, to 19.65 pounds, in London trading. The company first announced in April that it was considering structural changes to its business. Last week, BHP said its preferred option would be to seek a spinoff of some assets. Ahead of the announcement on Tuesday, analysts estimated that the company could carve off as much as $14 billion in assets. BHP Billitonâs chief executive, Andrew Mackenzie, said in a statement that the spinoff would allow the company to âmove toward a simpler portfolioâ and become âa higher-margin, higher-return business.â The spinoff would allow BHP Billiton to reduce costs and improve the productivity of its remaining operations more quickly, he said. 

 
 âOur core portfolio will be perfectly aligned to our strategy and remain diversified by commodity, geography and market,â Mr. Mackenzie said. His remarks came during a presentation to analysts as part of the companyâs announcement of its 2014 fiscal year profit, which rose 23.2 percent, to $13.8 billion, compared with $11.2 billion a year earlier. He added that âwith our broad exposure to steelmaking, energy, copper and, potentially, fertilizers, we are uniquely positioned to respond to changes in commodity demand.â The assets set to remain with BHP Billiton after the spinoff accounted for 96 percent of the companyâs underlying earnings before income tax in the fiscal year that ended June 30. Mr. Mackenzie noted that the company had already been streamlining its portfolio, selling about $6.5 billion in assets over the last two years. As for the new company, which will be based in Australia and will have about 24,000 employees and contractors, Mr. Mackenzie said it would âhave a competitive position across the broad range of commodities.â âFrom Day 1, it will have a dedicated management team and new direction that will position it to increase the value of its asset base and accelerate productivity gains,â he added. David Crawford, who will retire from BHP Billitonâs board in November, is expected to serve as chairman of the new company, and Graham Kerr, BHP Billitonâs chief financial officer, is expected to be chief executive. The spinoff will require regulatory and shareholder approval and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2015. BHP Billitonâs shareholders are expected to receive 100 percent of the shares of the new company. The new company, which has not yet been named, is expected to be listed in Australia with a secondary listing in South Africa. It would probably seek to have American depositary receipts traded in the United States as well.   Advertisement
