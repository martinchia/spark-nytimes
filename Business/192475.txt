Portraits of women entrepreneurs. At the most recent meeting of the She Owns It business group, the owners talked about the pros and cons of various software solutions. Alexandra Mayzler, the owner of Thinking Caps Group, would like to find a software solution to manage tutor scheduling and client information, like progress reports. She is seeking something reliable and easy to use. Plenty of off-the-shelf options are intended for tutoring companies, but she said she was skeptical that they would meet her needs. âA lot of what we do right now is manual and it works just fine, but itâs just very time-consuming,â she said. It would be nice to move beyond storing information in Microsoft Word documents and emailing reports, she added. Ideally, tutors could log in, check their schedules, and file progress reports and their time sheets using one system. For now, the steps are disconnected.  âI thought about hiring somebody and having them design something for us, but ââ âYou donât want to do that,â said Beth Shaw, who owns YogaFit. “That would be really costly.” What about starting with an off-the-shelf option and hiring someone to customize it, asked Susan Parker, who owns Bari Jay. Thatâs what she did at her company. Ms. Mayzler acknowledged that she had not done enough research yet. But she said she was concerned about hiring a contractor who would create or customize a program — and then âgo away,â she said. âThen something breaks, and weâre totally stuck because I canât fix it.â She said she still preferred to write everything down in a notebook. While Google offers some solutions, Ms. Mayzler said she saw drawbacks. âGoogle keeps changing things and their privacy stuff really concerns me,â she said. Besides, she continued, with Google, âIf I have a problem thereâs nobody to really help, itâs like, troubleshoot yourself.â Then again, a Google product would have fewer kinks than something more customized, she said. Ultimately, Ms. Mayzler said she lacked the time to figure it all out. âYou could hire someone to figure it out and make recommendations to you,â Ms. Shaw said. âRight, then I have to find that person, and how do I find a person thatâs actually reliable?â Ms. Mayzler asked, rhetorically. Jessica Johnson, who owns Johnson Security Bureau, suggested an application called Apollo that offers time-tracking and scheduling as well as a mailbox in the cloud for a monthly fee. Ms. Mayzler said she would look into it. She added that she was also extremely âparanoidâ about the customer and tutor information Thinking Caps must maintain, which included the Social Security numbers of staff members for payroll purposes. The possibility that the data could be lost or hacked worried her, she said. âIf you think about every piece of information that you have and every potential step you could take to protect that, it really is enough to drive you crazy,â Ms. Johnson said. Shifting to a web-based platform is âscary and liberating at the same time,â Ms. Parker said. Her company, Bari Jay, is six weeks into the switch she discussed at a previous meeting. For now, Bari Jay is simultaneously running its old and new systems in case the new one âbackfires,â Ms. Parker said. While she is frustrated by the number of things that still need fixing, she said she feels as though, âweâre in decent shape.â âIs it off-the-shelf software?â Ms. Shaw asked. It is existing software that has taken two years to customize, said Ms. Parker, who said she was excited that Bari Jayâs employees could now do certain tasks remotely. For example, she said, âIf we have a snow day, I donât have to worry about people killing themselves, customer service can answer our calls from home.â You can follow Adriana Gardella on Twitter.
