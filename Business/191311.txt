 LOS ANGELES — The Weinstein Company said it planned to release the film “One Chance,” about the British reality-show singer Paul Potts, on Yahoo Screen — a free, advertising-supported streaming site — shortly before putting it in theaters. While Weinstein has lately used a rapid move from theaters to video-on-demand for films like the apocalyptic “Snowpiercer,” from its Radius unit, that streaming model is a paid one. “One Chance,” directed by David Frankel, stars James Corden and had a premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. It was briefly scheduled for release in January, but is now expected to open in the fall after screening on the Yahoo site. “Our partnership with Yahoo has allowed us to adapt and expand our reach to limitless audiences,” David Glasser, Weinstein’s chief operating officer, said of a move that would now expose “One Chance” to millions of potential online viewers before it lands in theaters. A version of this article appears in print on July 22, 2014, on Page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: Weinstein to Release Film on Yahoo’s Streaming Site.
