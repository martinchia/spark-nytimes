The activist doesn’t fall far from the tree. A hedge fund run by a former lieutenant of Carl C. Icahn, the billionaire investor famous for clashing with management, has teamed up with a major real estate developer to push for change at CommonWealth REIT. On Tuesday, Keith Meister, founder of Corvex Management and Mr. Icahn’s protÃ©gÃ©, and Jeff T. Blau, the chief executive of the developer Related Companies, disclosed a 9.8 percent ownership stake in CommonWealth. The investors published a letter they sent to CommonWealth management, along with a 50-page slide presentation that agitates for change at the company, based in Newton, Mass. Citing poor leadership, a board lacking independence and historical underperformance, Mr. Meister and Mr. Blau said that if management was unwilling to engage in discussions about how to improve the company, they would take further action.  The investors specifically took aim at a stock offering that CommonWealth announced on Monday, ordering management to abandon it because it was damaging to existing shareholders and a prime example of a bad management decision. “If the board fails to adequately respond, Corvex and Related are prepared to seek the removal of the board so that it may be replaced with five truly independent trustees,” the investors said. The investors’ stance comes as a slew of prominent hedge fund managers have gone public with complaints about public company management. In the energy sector, the hedge fund Elliott Management has pushed for a shake-up at the Hess Corporation and the investor TPG-Axon is seeking to oust the top executives and board at SandRidge Energy. David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital has attacked Apple for its management decisions, and William A. Ackman has publicly declared the nutrition company Herbalife a fraud. As the longtime right-hand man of Mr. Icahn, Mr. Meister fits squarely within this crew of agitators. Since starting Corvex two years ago, Mr. Meister has disclosed five different activist stakes, including CommonWealth.  He took a seat on the board of the food company Ralcorp Holdings and secured a seat on the board. He agitated for the sale of the company, and ConAgra acquired it last month for $5 billion. Last year, after he took a large position in the security business ADT, the company appointed Mr. Meister to its board. Mr. Meister worked at Icahn Enterprises for seven years before December 2010, when he began Corvex. At Icahn Enterprises, he served on several public company boards, including those of Motorola Mobility and the Federal-Mogul Corporation. Today, Corvex manages about $3 billion of assets. The Related Companies, a prominent property owner perhaps best known for its developments of the 26-acre Hudson Yards site and the Time Warner Center in Manhattan, is not normally in the business of taking activist positions in public companies. Yet several months ago, Mr. Blau, Related’s new chief executive, saw CommonWealth as a very undervalued and badly managed business, and partnered with Mr. Meister to accumulate a large position in the company. Related is making the investment out of its fund business that manages money for outside investors. CommonWealth REIT, which has a market value of about $1.3 billion, owns a large portfolio of 54 million square feet of real estate, mostly office properties in the United States and Australia. The company’s shares are trading at a sharp discount to the value of its property holdings, the filing shows.  Investors in the company, including Corvex and Related, blame a corporate structure that allows its president, Adam D. Portnoy, and his father, Barry M. Portnoy, a director at the company, to get paid lucrative fees for managing the company’s real estate. That, they say, creates an incentive to issue stock and acquire more real estate assets, which increases the company’s property base along with management fees. Instead, the investors want CommonWealth to use cash to buy back the company’s discounted shares. The investors said that, according to public filings, over the last five years CommonWealth has paid out over $336 million in management fees to a company controlled by the Portnoys, a number representing more than 20 percent of the company’s market value. Wall Street analysts appear to agree. In a conference call last year, a Stifel Nicolaus analyst assailed CommonWealth in a comment directed at Adam Portnoy. “Donât take this personally and take it constructively please,” the analyst said, “But when I talk to investors about CommonWealth, the investment strategy, the balance sheet, the operations, thereâs just zero investor confidence out there. The term that most people use is ‘uninvestable.'” Shareholders seemed to support the initiatives suggested by Corvex and Related, who in the filing said that with better management, CommonWealth could hit a target share price of $50. In Tuesday morning trading, shares of CommonWealth spiked more than 35 percent, up $5.60 to $21.45.   Related Companies' presentation on Commonwealth REIT by      Advertisement
