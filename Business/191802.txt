Now that the British government has stripped the business minister, Vince Cable, of his power to oversee the News Corporationâs effort to buy BSkyB, the chances for a deal have greatly approved.  Mr. Cable lost responsibility for media policy on Tuesday after he told undercover reporters from The Daily Telegraph that he had “declared war” on News Corporation’s chief, Rupert Murdoch. The news came the same day that the European Commission approved the media company’s purchase of pay-TV operator BSkyB â a decision that left the British government as the last major hurdle for the acquisition. Mr. Cable, a Liberal Democrat, will be replaced by the culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, a Conservative lawmaker from South West Surrey, who has previously expressed his rather sanguine view of the deal.  Here is an excerpt of an interview Mr. Hunt gave to Broadcast magazine this summer, posted on his own site: “Rather than worry about Rupert Murdoch owning another TV channel, what we should recognize is that he has probably done more to create variety and choice in British TV than any other single person because of his huge investment in setting up Sky TV which, at one point, was losing several million pounds a day. “We would be the poorer and wouldn’t be saying that British TV is the envy of the world if it hadn’t been for him being prepared to take that commercial risk. We need to encourage that kind of investment.” After the removal of Mr. Cable, shares in BSkyB jumped nearly 2 percent, to 743 pence on Wednesday.  “Given that, in our view, Sky is likely to appeal or litigate any adverse opinion into the ground now, we move our probability of takeover to 90 percent,” said Steven Liechti, analyst at Investec Securities.
