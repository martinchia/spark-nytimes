Sara Lee said on Tuesday that it had named an executive to head the planned spinoff of its international beverage business.  Michiel Herkemij, 47, formerly of the Dutch brewing giant Heineken, will be chief executive of “CoffeeCo” — the still unnamed new company that will have brands like Douwe Egberts, Senseo and Pickwick.   Sara Lee announced in January that it would split into separate food and beverage companies after it had rejected two takeover approaches.  Beverages, which generated revenue of $4.6 billion last year, account for a little less than a third of Sara Lee’s overall business. The spinoff is expected to take effect sometime in the first half of next year. As part of its streamlining, Sara Lee announced this month the sale of its North American private-brand refrigerated dough business to Ralcorp for $545 million.  Mr.  Herkemij currently serves as president and chief executive of CuauhtÃ©moc Moctezuma, which was acquired by Heineken as part of its $7.6 billion takeover of Femsa last year. He had previously been chief executive of Heinekenâs Nigerian subsidiary. He will join Sara Lee on Dec. 1. Mr. Herkemij “is the right leader to bring ‘CoffeeCo’ to new heights and unleash the companyâs true potential due to his extensive international experience in Asia, Africa, South America and Europe, his proven ability to manage top-performing teams, and his very strong marketing and sales background,” Jan Bennink, Sara Lee’s chairman, said in a statement.
