Carl C. Icahn hasn’t exactly been quiet about his efforts to persuade Apple of the wisdom of a giant share buyback. Now, he’s on the cover of Time magazine pressing his case. In an article for the magazine — bearing the subheadline “Why Carl Icahn is the Most Important Investor in America” — the veteran activist shareholder said that he had filed a “precatory proposal” with the company to strengthen his cause. That fancily named initiative essentially lets shareholders vote on a nonbinding proposal advocating a big buyback. That Mr. Icahn has gone forward with a relatively mild approach, rather than a full-blown proxy contest, signals that he’s still unwilling to unleash the kind of vitriol that has marked scores of his campaigns over the years. (During his fight over Dell‘s proposed leveraged buyout, the activist asked in one letter, “What’s the difference between Dell and a dictatorship?”) This time, he has kept the tone civil. From the Time article: For his part, Icahn says he doesnât consider his proposal an indictment of Apple CEO Tim Cook, or the companyâs management, per se. âTim Cook is doing a good job with the business,â Icahn tells TIME. âI think heâs good whether he does what I want or not.â But, says Icahn, referring to the companyâs huge cash stockpile, âApple is not a bank.â and: Shareholders, say Icahn, deserve a bigger share. And Cook, he says, has been willing to consider his views. Icahn told TIME: âWeâve discussed a lot of things, and he asked a lot of questions, and really listened.â Icahn says his most recent conversation with Cook was a 20-minute phone call Nov. 21 — which Cookâs assistant initially tried to schedule at 5 a.m. Pacific Time. âThatâs usually when I go to bed! This guyâs tougher to get than the President,â laughs Icahn. And on Twitter, Mr. Icahn admitted that he was no longer seeking a buyback of $150 billion, but some unspecified increase. Gave $AAPL notice weâll be making a precatory proposal to call for vote to increase buyback program, although not at $150 billion level. â Carl Icahn (@Carl_C_Icahn) 4 Dec 13 For its part, Apple has been polite, if noncommittal. A spokesman for the iPhone maker told the magazine that it was reviewing its shareholder buyback program and would announce any changes sometime early next year. Advertisement
