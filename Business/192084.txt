In response to recent Bucks guide on holiday tipping, one reader noted, âI have never seen tipping guidelines for service personnel who disappoint you.â We thought the reader made an astute observation and we, too, wondered what is considered proper tipping etiquette when service — whether from a waiter, hairdresser or doorman — disappoints. To find out what to do when service is bad, we asked Peter Post, an etiquette expert at the Emily Post Institute whom we featured in an Ask an Expert series last year.
 According to Mr. Post, the time to show your disappointment with bad service is not when youâre giving a tip. Instead, you should complain before. âThe time to complain about it is the time when the service is poor,â he said. The tip, Mr. Post said, is part of what makes a waiterâs income livable and is often shared by many people. So, for instance, if you are at a restaurant and service is slow, or the waiter or kitchen messes up your order, Mr. Post recommends talking to the offending person and the manager and expressing your dissatisfaction. Often, youâll even get a free meal or at least a discount as consolation, much more than you would save by cutting the tip. The same philosophy should apply when dealing with service providers like hair stylists or dog walkers, Mr. Post said. Donât wait until a holiday tip to show your dissatisfaction. Instead, he said, let them know if they are disappointing you when the service is bad, and if they donât change their behavior, change service providers before a holiday tip would even be an issue. Still, there may be situations where you have less ability to change service providers or your complaints donât seem to have any impact. That could happen, for instance, in the case of a doorman. In such situations, Mr. Post said, it may be appropriate to cut your tip to less than you give the other doormen or not to give a tip at all, assuming youâve made a good effort to complain about the bad service. What do you think is an appropriate tip for bad service, and why?
