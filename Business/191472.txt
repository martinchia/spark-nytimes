A recent bankruptcy case reminds us how hard it would have been for Lehman Brothers to implement its good bank/bad bank plan to avoid Chapter 11.  And why corporations canât really expect to ditch their troubles by the side of the road, despite what some conspiracy theorists might think. The case involves Kerr-McGeeâs attempt to split itself into an oil and gas business, which was eventually acquired by Anadarko Petroleum, and everything else, which was eventually renamed Tronox.  Lucky Tronox got, among other things, a number of environmental cleanup sites. The split was completed in 2006, and by 2009, Tronox was in Chapter 11. Tronox has confirmed a reorganization plan, but continues to sue Kerr-McGee and Andarko, no doubt with the hope of using some of the proceeds to pay for the plan.   The suit alleges that Kerr-McGee breached fiduciary duties it owed to Tronox’s majority shareholder, that these duties are enforceable not only by shareholders but also by creditors since Tronox was insolvent at the time, and that Kerr-McGree incurred liability as Tronoxâs âsponsorâ during the spin-off. In Judge Allan Gropperâs recent decision in the United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan (a copy is below), all  these claims survived Kerr-McGee’s motion to dismiss. It is uncontested that under Delaware law, the duties of loyalty and care are owed not only by officers and directors, but also by controlling shareholders if the case involves allegations that the controlling shareholders obtained some sort of special benefit.  And while the question of duties to creditors is something of morass, to put it politely, it seems that the current state of Delaware law is that creditors too can enforce the foregoing fiduciary duties when a corporation is insolvent. Thus even if Lehman had been able to pull off the good bank/bad bank scheme in a way that did not constitute a fraudulent transfer â which seems unlikely, given its general inability to finance itself, how it expected to adequately capitalize the âbadâ sub escapes me â it would have faced years of litigation thereafter. All of which suggests that Lehman would have been better served by spending time planning for a controlled entry into Chapter 11.   But boards often have trouble facing reality, especially when they still believe their own credit ratings.
