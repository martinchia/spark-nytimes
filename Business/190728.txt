The government is taking a tough stance against Fabrice Tourre, the former Goldman Sachs executive found liable for civil fraud this year. The Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking $910,000 in fines against Mr. Tourre for his role in packaging and selling a failed mortgage investment, DealBookâs Michael J. de la Merced reports. The agency is also looking for the forfeiture of $175,463 in ill-gotten gains and $62,858.03 in interest. âTourreâs conduct helped cause more than one billion dollars in losses. He was rewarded with the largest bonus he had ever received,â lawyers for the S.E.C. wrote in a court filing on Monday, arguing in favor of the stiff penalty. âSevere misconduct must have consequences, particularly when the consequent financial loss is of such great magnitude.â Mr. Tourreâs lawyers are expected to respond next month, while the judge overseeing the case will ultimately determine how much he must pay. BIG SHIFT IN WALL ST. BONUSES THIS YEAR As bank executives huddle to figure out how to divide this yearâs spoils, an uncomfortable fact is emerging: M.&A. rainmakers and aggressive bond traders are unlikely to be the big winners this year. Instead, as Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column, the money will flow toward those who have worked on initial public offerings, the beneficiaries of stock markets that kept rising. And the bonuses for many finance professionals who do not work at hedge funds or asset managers will be lower over all. âItâs hard for some of my guys to accept, but the money is going to different people this year,â a senior executive of a large bank told Mr. Sorkin. Another senior banker said: âMany of us went into this business in the late 1980s or early 1990s when it was the coolest job in the world. Now being a hedge fund manager or out in Silicon Valley is where the real money is being made.â STEINBERG TRIAL GOES TO JURY The fate of Michael S. Steinberg, a former top official at SAC Capital Advisors accused of insider trading in technology stocks, now rests with the federal jury in his criminal case. Whether he is found guilty will likely hinge on if the jury believes the governmentâs star witness, a former subordinate who has already pleaded guilty to his own insider trading charges, DealBookâs Alexandra Stevenson writes.  Wrapping up his defense on Monday, Mr. Steinbergâs lawyer, Barry H. Berke, called the analyst, Jon Horvath, a liar. âIf you donât believe something a witness says, you can reject his entire testimony,â Mr. Berke told the jury. SURGE IN HERBALIFE SHARES AFTER RE-AUDIT Herbalife shares jumped by nearly 10 percent on Monday after the nutritional supplements maker said it had finished re-auditing its last three yearsâ worth of books with no major changes made, Mr. de la Merced writes. The stock jump again put the hammer on William A. Ackman, who is betting that Herbalife would collapse, asserting that it is an illegal pyramid scheme. But investors have kept pushing up the stock price, making Mr. Ackman pay dearly. Nevertheless, Mr. Ackman is undaunted, with his spokeswoman declaring in a statement: âHerbalife is a pyramid scheme that will be shut down by regulators.â     Â |Â  Contact: @m_delamerced | E-mail    Sign up for the DealBook Newsletter, delivered every morning and afternoon.   Frontier to Buy AT&Tâs Connecticut Wireline Network Â |Â  The Frontier Communications Corporation has agreed to pay $2 billion in cash to acquire AT&Tâs wireline business and fiber network in Connecticut.
