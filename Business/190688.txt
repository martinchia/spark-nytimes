LONDON â The British governmentâs long-awaited sale of its stakes in the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Lloyds Banking Group is inching closer. UK Financial Investments, the organization that manages the holdings on behalf of the British government, has asked investment banks to make their pitches to help sell the stakes in the two lenders, which both received multibillion-dollar bailouts during the financial crisis. The tender offer, released on Thursday, comes as the future of the governmentâs holding in both banks is at a crossroads.  The banks have shed billions of dollars of assets, reduced their exposure to risky assets and, in the case of the Royal Bank of Scotland, slashed its investment banking unit to refocus on its retail operations. British taxpayers own a 39 percent stake in Lloyds and a 82 percent holding in the Royal Bank Scotland. Earlier this month, George Osborne, the countryâs chancellor of the Exchequer, said the government was âactively considering options for share sales in Lloyds,â though he played down a similar offloading of Royal Bank of Scotland shares. Other local lawmakers have called for the breakup of the Royal Bank of Scotland to separate the firm’s toxic assets from its healthy banking operations. By inviting investment banks to help sell the British taxpayersâ stakes in the two lenders, UK Financial Investments has moved the ball forward on the privatizations, though questions remain over how long the eventually share sale will take. The tender, for which pitches must be submitted by July 8, asks investment banks to apply for four roles in the pending process: bookrunner, co-lead manager, capital markets adviser and financial adviser. Last year, Deutsche Bank helped UK Financial Investments to sell its stake in struggling British lender Northern Rock to Richard Bransonâs Virgin Money.  The potential privatization of the banks is likely to be highly contentious, as local politicians and analysts continue to battle over what to do with British taxpayersâ stakes. Some British lawmakers have called for the shares to be sold directly to retail customers to allow them to benefit from any potential increase in the firmsâ future share prices. A similar process in the 1980s led many British taxpayers to buy shares in former state-owned companies like the energy utility British Gas. Lloyds is likely to be the first to be privatized, as its current share price is above the governmentâs breakeven price of 61.20 pence, or 93 cents. Shares in the Royal Bank of Scotland, however, are still trading 33 percent below what the British government says it needs to recoup its investment. On Friday, Lloydsâ shares rose 1.6 percent, to 63.88 pence, in early afternoon trading in London, while the Royal Bank of Scotland’s stock price traded up slightly. The prospect of the British government selling its stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland took a hit earlier this month when its chief executive, Stephen Hester, abruptly announced that he would leave the bank by the end of the year. Mr. Hester had been widely praised for overseeing the bank’s restructuring, though the timing of any potential share sale had become highly politicized ahead of Britainâs general election to be held in 2015.  The bankâs board said they had asked Mr. Hester to step down so that they could appoint a new leader to oversee the privatization process, which could take the rest of the decade to complete.
