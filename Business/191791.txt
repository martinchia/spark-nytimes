Warren E. Buffett is widely regarded as one of the savviest investors on the planet. But it was during the financial crisis that he struck one of his most lucrative deals: a $5 billion investment in Goldman Sachs that has paid out more than $1 billion in dividends so far. And for now, Mr. Buffett will continue to reap those rewards thanks to an unlikely friend: the Federal Reserve. Yet at the same time, the Fed is limiting the Oracle of Omaha’s profits from another investment, Wells Fargo. In his annual letter to investors, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman and chief executive again discussed the firm’s investment in Goldman, made in September 2008 as the financial world was awash with fear. Berkshire’s $5 billion purchase of perpetual preferred shares in Goldman was aimed at allaying fears that even Wall Street’s mightiest investment bank could falter. But Mr. Buffett’s investment came with a heavy cost, as many lifelines do: 10 percent annual dividend payments. That comes out to more than $1 billion thus far — or more than $1.3 million a day. Goldman would dearly love to buy out Mr. Buffett’s financing, since the firm is on much stronger financial footing and alternative sources of capital are available for much cheaper. There’s one problem for the bank, as Mr. Buffett writes: The Fed must approve of any such buyback, and so far no blessing has been given. Still, that profitable ride may soon come to an end, as Mr. Buffett acknowledges. “Goldman Sachs has the right to call our preferred on 30 days notice, but has been held back by the Federal Reserve (bless it!), which unfortunately will likely give Goldman the green light before long,” he writes in the shareholder letter. Berkshire also made a similar $3 billion investment in General Electric in 2008, a deal that also carries a 10 percent annual dividend. Unlike Goldman, however, G.E. can buy back those perpetual preferred shares after three years — meaning in October — albeit at a 10 percent premium. Both the Goldman and G.E. investments are likely to end by year-end, Mr. Buffett writes. But while the Fed has been helping Berkshire in delaying Goldman’s repurchase of the preferred shares, it has been costing Mr. Buffett dividends at another financial institution, Wells Fargo. Through the crisis and its aftermath, the Fed has barred banks from raising their dividend payments, even though some firms survived in better shape than others. Even here, however, Mr. Buffett says that the Fed’s policy made sense at the time. More importantly, he thinks it will end soon, allowing Wells to raise its dividend to a more appropriate level. From the letter: The Federal Reserve, our friend in respect to Goldman Sachs, has frozen dividend levels at major banks, whether strong or weak, during the last two years. Wells Fargo, though consistently prospering throughout the worst of the recession and currently enjoying enormous financial strength and earning power, has therefore been forced to maintain an artificially low payout. (We donât fault the Fed: For various reasons, an across-the-board freeze made sense during the crisis and its immediate aftermath.) At some point, probably soon, the Fedâs restrictions will cease. Wells Fargo can then reinstate the rational dividend policy that its owners deserve. At that time, we would expect our annual dividends from just this one security to increase by several hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Advertisement
