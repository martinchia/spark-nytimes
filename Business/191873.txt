Soros Fund Management, the investment operation of the hedge fund billionaire George Soros, has named Scott Bessent its new chief investment officer. The firm also noted that Mr. Soros’s son Jonathan would be stepping away from day-to-day management of the firm to pursue other interests. The move comes about a month after the fund decided to return money to outside investors and convert itself into a so-called family office, which is a designation that restricts capital to family and employee money and is subject to minimal oversight by regulators. A number of hedge fund titans have in recent years decided to return money to outsiders and designate their investment operations a family office. They include Carl C. Icahn, Stanley Druckenmiller and Chris Shumway, among others. Mr. Bessent replaces Keith Anderson, whose resignation from the post was announced along with the firm’s decision to convert itself from a hedge fund. Mr. Bessent has previously worked for Soros, including a stint as head of London operations and head of global research. Most recently, Mr. Bessent worked at Protege Partners, an investment firm that seeds upstart hedge funds.  Bloomberg first reported the news of the appointment. Jonathan Soros leaves after nine years at the firm as a co-chairman along with his brother Robert. In a letter to employees, Mr. Soros thanked his son for his service. “Jonathan took the reins at the firm, together with Robert Soros, at a turbulent time and has been the principal architect of our transition to a healthy and stable investment operation,” Mr. Soros wrote in the letter.
