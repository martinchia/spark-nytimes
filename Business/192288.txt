 William R. Johnson, a former chief executive of H.J. Heinz, has joined the private equity firm Advent International as an adviser. Mr. Johnson, who stepped down last year after the buyout of Heinz by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital, will be an “operating partner” of Advent, an advisory role, the private equity firm said on Wednesday. He will help it evaluate possible investments in the consumer packaged goods and food industries. Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren E. Buffett, and 3G Capital, a private equity firm backed by Brazilian investors, bought Heinz for $23 billion. Mr. Johnson retired in June 2013, when the deal closed, after spending more than 15 years as chief executive. He first joined Heinz in 1982 as a general manager. Mr. Johnson serves on the boards of Emerson Electric and United Parcel Service. Advent, which was founded in 1984, has made a number of investments in consumer businesses, including the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf and Party City. “Bill is one of the premier executives in the consumer packaged goods industry,” Jeff Case, a managing director at Advent, said in a statement. “Billâs expertise in consumer products and food will complement our extensive experience in the retail space and further strengthen our ability to source new investments and drive value creation in our portfolio.” A version of this article appears in print on 07/03/2014, on page B6 of the NewYork edition with the headline: New Post.
