Updated, 9:51 a.m. | The Blackstone Group generated a higher profit in the first quarter as it reaped gains from selling its holdings. Blackstone, the biggest of the publicly traded private equity firms, said on Thursday that its economic net income â a measure of profit that includes unrealized gains from investments â rose 30 percent to $814 million in the first three months of the year from the same period a year earlier. The earnings amounted to 70 cents a share, beating the estimate of 55 cents by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Private equity firms have been taking advantage of buoyant stock markets to sell their investments and collect performance fees. Blackstone, the first of the big private equity firms to report first-quarter results, said its performance fees were $779 million in the quarter, an increase of 29 percent from a year earlier. The firmâs distributable earnings, a metric that reflects the cash it generates and can give to shareholders, rose 24 percent to $485 million. Still, Blackstone said its investment income, which includes unrealized gains or losses, fell 14 percent in the quarter to $116 million. Its private equity and real estate segments, traditionally strong performers, both reported lower investment income. But performance fees helped make up the difference. In private equity, Blackstone said its economic income more than tripled to $319 million, bolstered by performance fees that were more than five times higher than a year earlier. Among the deals completed in the first quarter, Blackstone sold energy assets in a joint venture to Devon Energy, realizing a gain in its largest buyout fund. It also sold shares in PBF Energy and Nielsen Holdings, which it had already taken public. As it generated cash from these sales and others, Blackstone returned $11.5 billion to investors in its funds in the quarter.  At the same time, Blackstone found opportunities to invest additional capital, striking deals that included an investment in the luxury label Versace. The firm said on Thursday that it had deployed or committed $7.4 billion in the first quarter.  âOur investors benefit from our ability to identify relative value across markets and deploy capital toward ideas with the best risk-reward profile,â Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. “As such, the environment for new investments has remained favorable for us.â One area of weakness was the financial advisory business, where Blackstone reported a $9.8 million loss. In real estate and credit, the firm reported lower economic income than in the previous yearâs quarter. But investors entrusted more money to Blackstone, helping push its assets under management to $272 billion, a 25 percent increase from last year. Blackstone said it now had $48 billion of capital it had yet to invest, known as dry powder. Blackstone prefers to report its profit using the nonstandard metric of economic net income. According to generally accepted accounting principles, Blackstone earned $266 million in the quarter, a 58 percent increase from the period a year earlier. âOver all, we are extremely well-positioned, we think, for the future,â Hamilton E. James, Blackstoneâs president and chief operating officer, said on a conference call.
