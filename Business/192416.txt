 LOS ANGELES — Helloooo, and welcome to Mr. Moviefone’s new gig. Russ Leatherman, who co-founded the Moviefone listing service 25 years ago and served until recently as its vociferous mascot, has teamed with HitFix.com, a fast-growing entertainment news site, to bring his Six-Second Review franchise to video. “Short, snackable, shareable — that’s what video needs to be, especially on mobile devices and social networks,” said Jennifer Sargent, HitFix’s chief executive. HitFix on Tuesday will start distributing the offshoot videos, which last 15 seconds if you include the introduction and an ad. Mr. Leatherman has provided bite-size movie and DVD reviews under the Six Second brand to radio stations since 2010, but the video component is new, as is advertiser sponsorship. “If you can build abs in six seconds, you can review a film in six seconds,” said Mr. Leatherman, who said goodbye last fall to Moviefone, which is now conducting a national contest to find a new corporate pitch-person. HitFix delivers about 90 million monthly video streams. The HitFix network includes screens in airports and retail outlets.
