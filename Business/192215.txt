Asahi Breweries, the largest beer producer in Japan, on Tuesday reported record annual earnings of 53.1 billion yen for 2010 and said it would use some of its cash pile of four billion yen to make deals this year. “Mergers and acquisitions will be one of the measures,” Naoki Izumiya, president of the company, said at a press conference in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg News.   But Mr. Izumiya denied Asahi was planning to pursue a division of Foster’s. “The price is expensive and recently market is looking tough,” he told Reuters, referring to the Australian market. Asahi said annual revenue increased 1.2 percent, to 1.5 trillion yen ($18.2 billion), and operating profit rose more than 15 percent. The company maintained its outlook for sales growth of 2.2 percent for the coming year.  Asahi plans to buy beverage companies in the Asia-Pacific region as part of an effort to increase sales there to one-fifth of its total, Bloomberg News quoted Mr. Izumiya as saying.  The company has been a busy deal-maker. Last year, Asahi said it would take a minority stake in Ting Hsin Holding of China.  It also bought the mineral water division of House Food and struck a deal for P&N Beverages Australia.  In 2009, it purchased Schweppes Australia from Cadbury for 1.2 million Australian dollars, as well as a 20 percent stake in Tsingtao Brewery from Anheuser Busch. Advertisement
