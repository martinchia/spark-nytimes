1:30 p.m. | Updated  The biotechnology company Human Genome Sciences on Thursday adopted a shareholder rights plan, or poison pill, as it sought to fend off a $2.59 billion takeover offer from the drug maker GlaxoSmithKline. The news comes a week after Glaxo, based in London, said it was taking its $13 a share offer for Human Genome Sciences directly to shareholders after first being rejected by the biotechnology company last month. âOur board of directors has concluded unanimously that the Glaxo offer is inadequate and does not reflect the value inherent in Human Genome Sciences,â H. Thomas Watkins, the companyâs chief executive, said in a statement on Thursday. The company adopted the poison pill, which activates when a third party acquires 15 percent of Human Genome Sciences’ stock. It is supposed to prevent any offers or transactions that the board determines are not in the best interest of the companyâs shareholders, according to the statement. Human Genome Sciences, based in Rockville, Md., said Glaxoâs offer of $13 a share was an opportunistic move to capitalize on the companyâs depressed share price, which had fallen more than 70 percent before the British drug maker made its initial approach on April 19.  Since the first offer, stock in Human Genome Sciences has nearly doubled, to $14.25 a share. In early afternoon trading on Thursday, the company’s shares had fallen 1.3 percent. Human Genome Sciences said it was still looking at its strategic options, which might lead to the company being sold. The company, which had asked Glaxo to participate in the discussions, said it was in talks with a number of pharmaceutical and biotech companies about a potential sale, though no decision had been made.  Human Genome Sciences is being advised by Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs. In response, Glaxo said that its offer represented fair value for both companies’ shareholders, and that the tender offer for Human Genome Sciences’ shareholders to sell their stakes in the company would still close on June 7th.
