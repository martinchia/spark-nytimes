The crowd began to buzz just before David Einhorn took the stage on Wednesday at the Ira Sohn Conference. Cellphone screens cast a fluorescent glow in the packed auditorium, as investors eagerly awaited the hedge fund managers latest tip. An image of Bart Simpson standing before a chalkboard was projected onto a large screen with the words “I will not pretend to be David Einhorn on earnings calls.” It was just the sort of inside joke that made everyone in attendance snicker. A few weeks ago, Mr. Einhorn, who is known for scathing analysis of companies, asked a question on the earnings call of Herbalife that helped send the company’s share price down.  But if the packed auditorium was expecting a clear, clean thesis from Mr. Einhorn, they were sorely disappointed. In a meandering presentation, Mr. Einhorn, chairman of Greenlight Capital, covered countries and companies all over the globe (short Japan, bearish on China, stoked about Norway), spending a minute or two on each, and even pitched something called GO-UPS. He did not even mention Herbalife. The money manager spent more time provoking laughter from his audience with funny images and clever jokes, even taking friendly jabs at colleagues like Daniel S. Loeb, another hedge fund manager, and not-too-friendly digs at foes, like Green Mountain Coffee. Mr. Einhorn did express excitement for Cairn Energy, a Scotland-based company with global reach. He said there was huge upside, as the share price was trading at a 20 percent discount to the company’s asset value. He mentioned Facebook obliquely, only to note that two of Japan’s largest social networks, DeNA and Gree, were not strong performers. He also spent some time on Amazon, wondering why, even as revenue has ballooned in recent years, the net income of the company had not moved in tandem. He then presented a new offering, posting a slide of a sale page on Amazon offering a minority stake in the Mets for $200 million —  a joke about his failed bid to buy a piece of the team. A note below the price noted that the “item was never really for sale.” He then called Amazon a riddle, seemingly unwilling to take it down or bring it up, and then took a shot at Dick’s Sporting Goods. He briefly mentioned Martin Marietta Materials, whose  stock plunged sharply on Wednesday after he recommended shorting the companyâs shares, and quickly moved on. Mr. Einhorn delved into Apple, a favored company of his, saying he thought it remained undervalued. He added that suggestions that hedge funds were crowding the trade were unfounded. He even suggested that Apple could have a $1 trillion market cap one day. Finally, in the nearly half-hour whirlwind, Mr. Einhorn pitched something that doesn’t yet exist: GO-UPS, which, according to one of the last of his 137 slides, are Greenlight Opportunistic Use of Preferreds, a strategy that involves buying preferred shares of companies. There was no time for details as his allotted time wound down. But at the end, Mr. Einhorn directed audience members to his firm’s Web site for more information on GO-UPS. Advertisement
