The efforts of Irving H. Picard, the trustee tasked with recovering assets for victims of Bernard L. Madoffâs enormous Ponzi scheme, faces an important test on Thursday.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is considering an appeal by a group of investors who argue that Mr. Picardâs way of calculating losses deprives them of the opportunity to recover assets. At issue: the so-called net investment method, which the trustee used to deny the claims of those believed to have profited from the fraud.  If the investors win, the total amount of legitimate claims for losses from the Ponzi scheme could increase to approximately $65 billion from about $20 billion. Early on, Mr. Picard took the position that an investor could not make a claim based on the brokerage statements supplied by Mr. Madoff because those numbers were fictitious. Mr. Picard has used this argument as the basis for numerous lawsuits against investors. Heâs hoping to recoup the false profits and use the money to repay other victims.  The case involves the Securities Investors Protection Act, the federal law that governs the liquidation of Mr. Madoffâs investment firm. The appeal focuses on a provision, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 78lll(11), which allows claims by customers for the ânet equityâ they had in the failed firm at the time of its collapse.  That term is defined as âthe sum which would have been owed by the [firm] to such customer if the [firm] had liquidated, by sale or purchase on the filing date, all securities positions of such customer.â  Itâs rare for a Ponzi scheme to run for such an extended period â and typically only a handful of innocent investors, if that, receive more than they put into the scheme. So this issue hasnât come up very often.  Mr. Madoffâs scam lasted for years and ensnared scores of investors who made numerous withdrawals. So Mr. Picard had to determine which claims were valid and which would be denied.  As Mr. Madoff never actually bought the securities listed on the account statements, there was nothing to be liquidated to determine losses. Instead, Mr. Picard interpreted ânet equityâ as the total cash a customer deposited into the firm.   Only those who invested more than they withdrew â the ânet losersâ â could recover the amount of their loss. Those who took out more than they invested â the ânet winnersâ â were left with no claim, even though their accounts statements showed large balances.   The net winners challenged Mr. Picardâs interpretation in Federal Bankruptcy Court in New York. These investors include Sterling Equities Associates, the investment vehicle for Saul Katz and Fred Wilpon, owners of the New York Mets. But the court sided with Mr. Picard. The ruling allowed him to pursue clawback lawsuits against the net winners like the estate of Jeffrey Picower, which settled for $7.2 billion. Mr. Picard is also looking to get back $1.5 million against the former general counsel of the Securities and Exchange Commission related to an account held by his motherâs estate.   The trustee has gone even further in his claims against Mr. Katz and Mr. Wilpon. Mr. Picard is seeking $300 million in profit plus an additional $700 million. The extra amount is for the Madoff profits used to fund other ventures, including the Mets. Those claims are dependent on Mr. Picardâs interpretation of ânet equityâ being upheld. A brief filed by Sterling Equities, Mr. Katz and Mr. Wilpon’s investment vehicle, in the Second Circuit argues that the amount listed on the last account statement issued by Mr. Madoffâs firm is the proper basis for calculating ânet equity.â By that argument, Mr. Katz and Mr. Wilpon would not be net winners â provided the total on the last statement doesnât exceeded what they invested. This interpretation of ânet equityâ would result in the amount of legitimate claims for losses from the Ponzi scheme increasing to approximately $65 billion from about $20 billion. And if the Mets owners have valid claims for losses from the Ponzi scheme, then there would be no basis for Mr. Picard to claim the additional $700 million in benefits he said the Metsâ owners reaped. One hint about where the Second Circuit may come out is an 2006 opinion of In re New Times Securities Services, Inc. Itâs another case involving a Ponzi scheme in which customers sought to rely on statements listing nonexistent securities as the basis for their claims.   The Appeals Court explained that it âdeclined to base the recovery on the rosy account statements telling customers how well the imaginary securities were doing, because treating the fictitious paper profits as within the ambit of the customersâ âlegitimate expectationsâ would lead to the absurdity of âdupedâ investors reaping windfalls as a result of fraudulent promises made on fake securities.â The author of that 2006 opinion was Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs, who is one of the three judges on the panel hearing the Madoff-related appeal.  If he views the earlier opinion as controlling in cases involving fictitious account statements, then Mr. Picardâs position will in all likelihood be vindicated. And if the Court of Appeals upholds the Bankruptcy Court, I think it is unlikely the Supreme Court would get involved in the case. The interpretation of ânet equityâ arises infrequently. And it is a narrow question of statutory construction that the Supreme Court usually does not deal with, especially if two lower courts already agreed on the matter. The Second Circuit is not the only place where Mr. Picardâs interpretation of ânet equityâ is being questioned.  Representative Scott Garrett of New Jersey introduced a bill (H.R. 757) that would base the definition of ânet equityâ on the last account statement an investor received. If enacted, this would undermine Mr. Picardâs clawback suits against investors who withdrew more than they put into Mr. Madoffâs Ponzi scheme.   The proposed law would also prohibit a trustee from seeking to recover âany property transferredâ to a customer of a securities firm before it failed â unless the customer knew the firm âwas involved in fraudulent activity.â  If applied to the liquidation of Mr. Madoffâs firm, lawsuits like those against the owners of the Mets would disappear.  Whether Congress will side with investors like Mr. Katz and Mr. Wilpon remains to be seen. Madoff Trustee Appeal Brief  Madoff Appellants Brief  Advertisement
