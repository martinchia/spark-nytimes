LONDON — AndrÃ© Esteves, the chief executive of the Brazilian bank BTG Pactual, was fined 350,000 euros ($457,000)  by the Italian financial regulator on Monday for insider trading. The news comes as BTG Pactual, a Brazilian investment banking powerhouse, is planning to raise as much as $2.24 billion in an initial public offering. Italian authorities also said that Mr. Esteves, who owns almost one-fourth of BTG Pactual, would not be able to hold board positions in Italy for six months.  The fine and other legal actions relate to the purchase of shares in an Italian meat company by Mr. Esteves in 2007. Authorities said the purchase was based on insider information about the company, Cremonini, entering into a joint venture with a Brazilian rival, JBS. The trades were conducted on Mr. Estevesâs personal trading account when he was working at UBS, the Italian regulator said in a statement.  Mr. Esteves sold BTG Pactual to the Swiss bank for $3.1 billion in 2006. He, along with other partners, bought the Brazilian bank back from UBS in 2009 for $2.5 billion. BTG Pactual has become a symbol of Brazilâs growing economic muscle. The bankâs I.P.O. has been eagerly awaited after several years of limited activity in the country’s capital markets.  A successful offering is likely to mean more deals coming from BTG Pactual itself. The bank has been engaged in aggressive deal-making, spending more than $1.5 billion in acquisitions since last October.  It would be also be a sign of investor appetite for Brazil. If the high end of the I.P.O. price range is met, it would value the company at roughly $20 billion, well over three times its book value. BTG Pactual is itself leading the book-building, and Bradesco BBI, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citibank, BB Investimentos, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, UBS, XP Investimentos and BES Investimento are also participating.
