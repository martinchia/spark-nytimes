DERIVATIVES RULE SET TO CHANGE   |  Regulators and large banks are expected to agree this weekend on a change to derivatives that is intended to curb the damage caused by the crash of a large bank, DealBookâs Peter Eavis writes. Many in the industry view the change as evidence that banks and regulators are substantially reducing the threat that large banks pose to the financial system and the wider economy. But while consumer advocates say that they support the change, they also contend that it does not do enough to dislodge the privileged, and potentially precarious, position that they say derivatives still occupy in the financial system. The ability of failures in the $700 trillion derivatives market to cause serious financial pain became apparent when Lehman Brothers, a big derivatives trader, collapsed. Under derivatives contracts, Lehmanâs trading partners had the right to immediately terminate their derivatives trades when the company declared bankruptcy. As a result, Lehmanâs derivatives trades had to be unwound quickly and chaotically, causing huge new losses for the company and disruption in the wider market. Since then, regulators have specifically wanted a brief delay before derivatives contracts could be unilaterally terminated after a bank collapsed. Such a delay could give the regulatory authorities time to sell the failing company or rapidly restructure the business.  Banks and their legal representatives say changes to the derivatives contracts could go a long way toward ending the too-big-to-fail problem, or the threat that some banks are so big that the government would be forced to bail them out to shield the wider economy. Without the change, they say, the government would have a much harder time winding down a big bank in an orderly fashion. Still, some critics of the banking industry say more must be done. Even after the change, derivatives will enjoy superior rights. The new provision would still allow a derivative to be terminated early if the entity directly on the other side of a derivatives trade went into a bankruptcy proceeding like Chapter 11. 

WHITE HOUSE ALARMED BY JPMORGAN BREACH  |  President Obama and his top national security advisers began receiving periodic briefings on the huge cyberattack at JPMorgan Chase and other financial companies this summer, DealBook reports. But administration officials say no one could tell the president what he most wanted to know: the motive of the attack. âThe question kept coming back, âIs this plain old theft, or is Putin retaliating?ââ one senior official said. More than three months after the first attacks were found, the source is still unclear and there is no evidence that any money was taken from any institution.
In all, the authorities believe that the hackers may have tried to infiltrate about a dozen financial institutions, said one of the people briefed on the matter. Fidelity Investments and E*Trade are among those institutions that law enforcement officials believe were victimized in some way by the attacks. While Deutsche Bank and Bank of America scanned their systems, the people said, they did not find any evidence that the hackers had tried to get in. At least five other banks â ADP, Bank of the West, Citigroup, HSBC and Regions Financial â found that one of the same web addresses used to penetrate JPMorgan had tried to get into their systems. The F.B.I. has begun a criminal inquiry into the attacks, and the Secret Service has also been involved.  
Questions are now being asked about whether financial institutions should be obligated to report such attacks. Under federal and state law, JPMorgan did not have to alert customers about the breach because the bank determined that only contact information was breached. A number of state attorneys general have opened investigations into the breach, and there are talks about whether to expand a law that requires companies to alert consumers in a timely fashion if their financial information was taken to include nonfinancial information as well. The breach is under investigation by Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, according to a person briefed on the matter.



CHINESE RETURN TO THE WALDORF  |  Forty years after Deng Xiaoping, the vice premier and eventual paramount leader of China, stayed at the Waldorf Astoria during his first visit to the United States, an obscure Chinese insurance company, Anbang Insurance, is buying the hotel with plans to restore the 83-year-old Art Deco building to its original splendor, David Barboza writes in DealBook. The company, which started just a decade ago, has managed to build up the capital and connections to broker the largest deal ever by a Chinese investor for an American building, agreeing to pay $1.95 billion for the 47-story tower owned by Hilton Worldwide Holdings.
The record purchase reflects the growing global influence of Chinaâs business elite. Today, private companies, along with the state-owned giants, are behind a surge in overseas investments. The broad push is being led by Chinaâs richest and most powerful companies like the Alibaba Group, but younger companies like Anbang Insurance, with deep pockets, mysterious owners and significant political influence, are increasingly jumping into the fray. Anbang is controlled, in part, by the members of Chinaâs ruling class, relatives of some of the Communist revolutionary leaders who took control of the country in 1949, among them Mr. Dengâs grandson-in-law.
Authorities in Beijing have encouraged companies to look abroad to improve their capabilities and acquire new technologies. As growth flags at home, overseas investments also offer the opportunity for Chinese companies to earn hefty returns. âWhile global companies have welcomed the flood of money, the deal-making has also been greeted by skepticism. Given the overarching influence of the Chinese government on private business, such deals have raised concerns at times,â Mr. Barboza writes. âThe Chinese push into the global markets has quickly evolved in the past decade from investing largely in mines and building materials to buying up luxury villas, French vineyards and world-class hotels.â The Waldorf Astoria purchase is Anbangâs first significant foray into the United States.

GEITHNER DEFENDS A.I.G. BAILOUT  |  The federal government firmly pushed back on Wednesday against the notion that its 2008 bailout of the insurance giant American International Group was beyond the powers of the countryâs central bank, Aaron M. Kessler writes in DealBook. Former Treasury Secretary Timothy F.
