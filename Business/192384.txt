Warren Buffett and Larry Van Tuyl discuss Berkshire Hathawayâs deal to buy the nationâs largest privately-owned auto dealership. Updated, 5:29 p.m. |  Warren E. Buffett already owns planes and trains, so why not a car dealership as well? Mr. Buffett’s holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, said on Thursday that it would buy the Van Tuyl Group, the country’s fifth-biggest auto dealership by sales and the biggest that is privately held.  Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it is unlikely to make a significant dent in Berkshire’s war chest for acquisitions, which amounted to $55.5 billion in cash as of June 30.  The acquisition is the latest move by Mr. Buffett into transportation, adding to businesses like NetJets, the private jet company, and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad operator. Now Mr. Buffett is adding the Van Tuyl Group, founded by Cecil Van Tuyl in 1955 as a single Chevrolet dealership in Kansas City, Kan. The company has grown to 78 dealerships across the country, with nearly $8 billion in revenue last year, according to Automotive News. That puts it behind publicly traded auto dealers like AutoNation, which reported $17.5 billion in revenue, and the Penske Automotive Group, with $14.7 billion in revenue. When the acquisition closes, the Van Tuyl Group â to be renamed Berkshire Hathaway Automotive â will continue to be led by Cecil Van Tuyl’s son, Larry, and Jeff Rachor. In an interview, Larry Van Tuyl said that he first sought out an audience with Mr. Buffett around eight years ago to explore a potential sale of the business. At the time, the Berkshire chief was not interested. But as the billionaire continued to study the auto dealership business, he grew more interested. Among the principle attractions of the Van Tuyl Group is that individual dealer proprietors receive a minority interest in the business, giving them incentives to run the most effective business possible, according to Brad Eichler, the co-head of investment banking at Stephens and an adviser to the car dealership.  The Van Tuyl Group also has a broader-than-usual array of businesses, including insurance and auto auctions in addition to retail sales. In addition, the company owns the real estate underlying its various dealer operations.  Around four years ago, Van Tuyl Group hired Mr. Eichler and his team to more closely study strategic options, including a potential sale of the company. But for Larry Van Tuyl, the most preferable buyer was Mr. Buffett.  “Heâs a very charismatic, charming, straight talking super guy,” Larry Van Tuyl said. He later added, “Mr. Buffett allows you to run the business the way you always have been.” Over numerous meetings at Berkshire’s headquarters in Omaha — discussed over Mr. Buffett’s preferred beverage, Coca-Cola — the two eventually came to an agreement. The deal will most likely not be the last one Mr. Buffett strikes in the sector. “I fully expect we’ll buy a lot more dealerships over time,” he said on CNBC. The investment banking firm Stephens and the law firm DLA Piper advised the Van Tuyl Group, while Munger, Tolles & Olson provided counsel to Berkshire.
