Across the country, there is a booming business in lending to poor people with bad credit who need cars to get to work. But this market is âas much about Wall Streetâs perpetual demand for high returns as it is about used cars,â DealBookâs Michael Corkery and Jessica Silver-Greenberg report. âAn influx of investor money is making more loans possible, but all that money may also be enabling excessive risk-taking that could have repercussions throughout the financial system.â As it did with mortgages, Wall Street is bundling together thousands of subprime auto loans and selling them to investors. Led by companies like Santander Consumer; GM Financial, General Motorsâ lending unit; and Exeter Finance, an arm of the Blackstone Group, such securitizations have grown 302 percent, to $20.2 billion since 2010, according to Thomson Reuters IFR Markets. Subprime securitizations increased 28 percent from 2013. In a time of low interest rates, investors are drawn to the relatively high returns of such securities, which ratings firms have nevertheless deemed as safe as some Treasury securities. âNow questions are being raised about whether this hot Wall Street market is contributing to a broad loosening of credit standards across the subprime auto industry,â Mr. Corkery and Ms. Silver-Greenberg write. The intense demand for subprime auto securities may also be fueling a rise in loans that contain falsified income or employment information. The Justice Department in Washington is coordinating an investigation among prosecutorsâ offices across the country into whether such faulty information ended up in securitization deals, according to people briefed on the inquiries.  SNOW DAY  |  The streets of Manhattan were quiet early Tuesday morning, silenced by the snowstorm
 that bore down on the Northeast region overnight. Many Wall Street workers left their offices early on Monday or chose to work from home. One private equity firm in midtown Manhattan allowed everyone to leave by 3:30 p.m., with the promise that they would be available to work remotely. State and local governments delayed at least $1.3 billion of bond sales, including a $1 billion general obligation deal from Pennsylvania, because of the storm. Stock exchanges were expected to stay open on Tuesday. New York City seemed to have been spared the brunt of the storm, but Long Island, Cape Cod and New England were battered by snow and high winds.
As of Tuesday morning, driving bans were still in effect across New York City, New Jersey and Connecticut. Schools in New York City and New Jersey will be closed on Tuesday. A list of whatâs closed and whatâs open in the region is available here.  PAY RATIO RULE STALLS  |  Almost five years ago, a provision was passed as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform act to try to quantify the ratio between the pay of chief executives at successful companies and the pay of their median workers. But a fierce debate over the disclosure requirement has delayed adoption of that section of the law, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook Column. Corporate America has resisted the rule as a politically motivated gimmick. And indeed, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has said that disclosing the pay ratio would âshame companies into lowering C.E.O. pay.â The Securities and Exchange Commission has so far avoided ruling on how to put the requirement in place. And when the law is put into effect, it appears it will be âwatered down and made so complicated as to be worthless,â Mr. Sorkin writes. âWith all the wiggle room that is expected to be allowed, companies may devise ratio numbers that are largely irrelevant. Investors, who actually could benefit, even if only marginally, from knowing the ratio will probably have an impossible time interpreting what the ratio shows.â âThatâs not to say the S.E.C. shouldnât force the disclosure of the ratio. It should, and soon. After all, it is a law and until and unless Congress decides to change the law, it should be enforced,â Mr. Sorkin adds. âThe big question will be in how it is used â or potentially misused â and how it may change corporate America.â  ON THE AGENDA  |  The Federal Open Market Committee convenes its January meeting.

But suggest the comparison to Ms. Morrissey, a 48-year-old money manager, and she smiles politely and insists she is doing her own thing, Jenny Anderson writes in DealBook. Four years ago, Ms. Morrissey founded the 30% Club, an organization that seeks to increase the representation of women on boards to that number. Unlike approaches others have taken, Ms. Morrissey -â petite, charismatic and impeccably stylish â has directed her focus on Britainâs most powerful men. âWorking behind the scenes, she has persuaded 120 of the countryâs top chairmen that they want what she wants: more diverse boards that will produce better company returns,â Ms. Anderson writes. âThe approach has produced some remarkable results. Since 2010, the percentage of women on Britainâs top boards has nearly doubled, to 23 percent, while in the United States, the figure has crept up a few percentage points to 17 percent.â She adds: âThat Ms. Morrissey is credited with spearheading those results while raising nine children -â ages 5 through 23 -â could have made her the target of ire in a country that does not always celebrate success. Or it might have fueled the debate about whether a woman can or cannot have it all. It has done neither.â    |  Contact: @melbournecoal | E-mail  Dentons to Merge With Dacheng of China to Create Worldâs Largest Law Firm  |  The new firm, with more than 6,500 lawyers in more than 50 countries, aims to take advantage of Chinaâs growing economic heft and the increasing number of deals being done overseas by its companies.
