LONDON â The Swiss bank UBS said on Monday that it planned to buy back 1.75 billion euros, or about $2.37 billion, in bonds as part of an effort to reduce the size of its balance sheet and its future interest expense. The tender offer relates to five subordinated bonds in Swiss francs, euros or pounds, and six senior unsecured bonds in francs, euros, Italian lira or pounds. The tender offer is set to expire on Dec. 13. âThis transaction is consistent with our proactive approach to reducing our balance sheet and future interest expense while maintaining our strong liquidity, funding and capital position,â UBS said. In February, UBS announced plans to buy back 5 billion francs, or about $5.6 billion, of its bonds as part of a continuing cost-cutting effort. The bank, Switzerland’s largest, has been under pressure from regulators to increase the amount of cash it has available to address legal and compliance issues. UBS said on Monday that it expected to incur a small loss on the latest buyback, but believed that would be offset by a decrease in its future interest expense. The transaction is expected to reduce its capital ratio by 0.2 to 0.5 percent. Shares of UBS rose slightly, to 17.32 francs, in afternoon trading on Monday.  Advertisement
