Economists are scrambling to understand why Americans are so pessimistic about the economy. As I describe in an article in Wednesday’s paper, a leading theory blames the funk on the collapse in housing prices, which has erased a vast amount of wealth and convinced many Americans that they will never recover financially. A new paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston makes an important refinement in this theory. The authors report that even in areas like Orlando, where housing prices have fallen most sharply, the loss of confidence is not pervasive. The people who are most glum are the ones who say that they or someone close to them have “lost a lot of money in the real estate market.” Those people, hit hardest by the crisis, have lost faith in the value of home ownership. But the rest of the population has not. They still want to own homes. And there’s another wrinkle. Even among those who lost of a lot of money, the reaction varies. Younger people reported a loss of confidence, but the effect diminished with age. Respondents older than 58 said that they now viewed housing as an even better investment in the aftermath of the crash. The authors, Anat Bracha and Julian Jamison, both are researchers at the Boston Fed’s Center for Behavioral Economics. They conducted the study by adding questions to the July and August editions of the Michigan consumer survey, which is based on interviews with 2,000 Americans each month. Restricted in the number of questions they could pose, the authors did not differentiate between people who lost a lot of money and those who were affected by such a loss by someone close to them. Nor did they attempt to quantify the extent of losses, relying instead on the judgment of the respondents. The result shows at a minimum that for people who considered the crisis a big deal, a frequent consequence is a loss of faith in home ownership. Why are older homeowners more likely to retain their confidence? The authors speculate that their long-held beliefs may be less malleable. Another possibility is that they are less interested in the investment potential of their homes, and more inclined to evaluate their homes primarily as places to live.
