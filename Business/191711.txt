 The stock market drifted between small gains and losses on Thursday, with the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index barely rising to a nominal all-time high, its second in two days. Investors looked beyond the day’s economic data and focused instead on corporate news from companies like Coach, Pier 1 Imports and Kroger. “Right now we’re in a situation where they’re pretty boring markets, just a slow, easy grind,” said Chris Gaffney, a senior market strategist at EverBank Wealth Management. The S.&P. 500 rose 2.50 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,956.98. The Dow Jones industrial average added 14.84 points, or 0.1 percent, to 16,906.62. But the Nasdaq composite index slipped 3.51 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,362.84. Advertisement The string of record highs has the S.&P. 500 running well ahead of its 50-day moving average. That suggests it could be ready for a pullback, said Jim Russell, senior equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. He still expects the market to move higher in coming months.

            Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals yesterday.         16,925 Previous close 16,906.62 16,900 16,875 16,850 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m. Despite its upward bent, the market has been mostly registering small moves, reflecting a cautious mood on the part of many investors heading into summer, as well as lingering concern over the possible fallout from the crisis in Iraq and questions over the resiliency of the American economy. The economy shrank at an annual rate of 1 percent in the first quarter, weighed down by a severe winter that slowed business activity. Many analysts anticipate growth will have rebounded strongly in the second quarter. “We know the economy is showing signs of improvement, and we’ve seen that trajectory over the past two or three months,” Mr. Russell said. “To move the equity market to a higher level we need to see anecdotal evidence that company earnings are starting to increase.”  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The market will get a sense of that next month, when the next round of corporate earnings begins. Until then, the next key market mover will most likely be the June employment report, due out the first week of July. Among the stocks on the move, Coach was the biggest loser in the S.&P. after the luxury goods company said it would shutter about 70 underperforming stores in a bid to regain ground lost to competitors. Its stock fell $3.50, or 8.9 percent, to $35.69. Stock in Pier 1 Imports tumbled $2.40, or 13.1 percent, to $15.86 after the furniture retailer’s quarterly profit fell short of Wall Street expectations. In contrast, Kroger shares rose $2.39, or 5.1 percent, to $49.66 after the supermarket operator raised its earnings forecast for the year. In the bond market, interest rates moved higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.62 percent from 2.59 percent late Wednesday, while its price dropped 8/32, to 98 31/32.
