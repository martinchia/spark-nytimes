Googleâs Schmidt Sees âBubbleâ  Google has made 87 acquisitions worth $8.4 billion in the last 10 years, but the recent high valuations placed on some high-profile Internet companies has Eric Schmidt scratching his head. âThere are clear signs of a bubble,”  Mr. Schmidt told the Swiss magazine Bilanz. âBut valuations are what they are.â Reuters (For those DealBook readers who read German â or who perhaps those who will work at the New York Stock Exchange â hereâs a link to Bilanz.) The Twitter Talk Speaking of sky-high Internet valuations, Felix Salmon has issues with some of the talk questioning how Twitter can possibly be worth $10 billion. Some 12 percent of people on the Internet use Twitter, compared with 62 percent for Facebook, according to a Pew Research Center survey. âIf Twitter is 20 percent the size of Facebook, and Facebook is worth $50 billion, then Twitter can be worth $10 billion, no?,â  Mr. Salmon notes. âThe point here is that Twitter is becoming central to how people communicate with each other â a key part of the new social architecture.â Reuters Market Making Myth  âA big problem in taking about market making versus position trading is that, Goldman piety to the contrary, the two are closely linked,â says Yves Smith. She points to a recent slide-show presentation by Goldman Sachs that, she says, âgives reason to question that much has changed on Wall Street regarding the role of position taking, now taxpayer supported, in firm profits.â Naked Capitalism  Money Changes Everything Simon Johnson points to a study by Sanjai Bhagat and Brian Bolton as evidence bolstering the view that Wall Street compensation practices fueled excessive risk-taking that led to the financial crisis.  The study looked at the compensation of the executives of the top 14 financial institutions in the United States from 2000 to 2008.  The crucial finding, Mr. Johnson says, quoting the study, is that  chief executives are â30 times more likely to be involved in a sell trade compared with an open-market buy tradeâ of their own bankâs stock and âthe dollar value of sales of stock by bank C.E.O.âs of their own bankâs stock is about 100 times the dollar value of open market buys.â Economix A VC Exits  Emily Melton has left the venture capital firm Mayfield, Dan Primack reports.
