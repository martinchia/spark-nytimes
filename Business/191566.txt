Every year, the world’s elites flock to the World Economic Forum to either solve the world’s economic problems, drink flights of 100-point Parker wines or both, simultaneously. And every year, non-elites mistake Davos, the quaint Swiss villa where the forum is held, with Davros, the evil arch-nemesis character in the British sci-fi television series “Doctor Who.” Davros, says the BBC, creates a class of mutants called the Daleks to “ensure the survival of his race and, ultimately, their mastery over all of creation.” This year, some in the Twittersphere still couldn’t get it right. @devonsaysrelax devon Each time I read about the “Davos Conference” I mistakingly read it as “Davros Conference” which makes me think: “DOCTOR WHO CONFERENCE.” Thu Jan 26 19:47:35  via devon @GaryInToronto Gareth! Davos sounds a lot like Davros so I keep wondering why the Daleks are meeting in Switzerland #fb Fri Jan 27 0:22:50  via Gareth! @jennyangliss Jenny Angliss Every time they talk about #Davos I think they’re saying #Davros. He’d sort the economy out by giving them a hard stare and zapping them. Thu Jan 26 21:03:36  via Jenny Angliss Still, despite being misunderstood by sci-fi nerds the world over, the event in Davos â the one in Switzerland â is proceeding at a brisk, impressive clip this week. In the last 24 hours, Timothy F. Geithner told Davos-goers that 2 percent to three percent growth in the United States would be in the realm of possibility. Also in the realm of possibility: an armistice between Occupy Davos and the WEF, after the WEF founder, Klaus Schwab, offered to meet with the protestors on Saturday. On camera, Lawrence H. Summers talked on CNBC about getting the economy back on track and Sean Parker told DealBook’s Andrew Ross Sorkin that an Facebook I.P.O. could be the biggest public offering in history. Brian T. Moynihan, the chief executive of Bank of America, told Bloomberg TV that, contra James P. Gorman of Morgan Stanley, he would not tell his employees to leave if they were unhappy over subpar bonuses. “Our employees know what they’re contributed and how they’re paid,” Mr. Moynihan said. “I just stay away from that.” And while Bloomberg’s Christine Harper reported that big-name bankers seem more cautious this year, Henry Blodget of Business Insider caught two moguls dishing on their private jet plans. As for the Twitter cadre of reporters, industry bigwigs and hangers-on whose every Davos dispatch enraptures us? Sadly, it seems that the endless parties and world-solving sessions of the last three days have worn them down. @DeirdreHipwell Deirdre Hipwell Davos Day Three Everyone starting to look rumpled and “tired” (aka hungover)…Ed Miliband walked past in exceedlngly creased suit tut tut Fri Jan 27 8:06:23  via Deirdre Hipwell @amoren Ahmet M Oren Two parties and dinner done.

Eric Schmidt & Steve Cohen were there. I smoked a cigar and feel a tad worse for wear. #Davos Fri Jan 27 10:58:12  via Clare O’Connor Stay strong, brave Davosians. Only two more days! Advertisement
