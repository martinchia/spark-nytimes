International Coal Ventures of India has no plans to link up with the Tata Group, should Tata attempt to counter Rio Tinto’s takeover bid for the coal producer Riversdale Mining, the countryâs steel minister, Virbhadra Singh, told Dow Jones Newswires on Monday. “This is a company formed by various public sector companies,” Mr. Singh said in the interview, referring to International Coal. “So, as it stands, it cannot take in a nonpublic sector company as a partner.” There was speculation that International Coal, a consortium that includes five state-run mining companies, would try to partner with the Tata Group to challenge Rio Tintoâs bid of 3.9 billion Australian dollars ($3.9 billion), which was announced last week.  Tata Steel is Riversdaleâs largest shareholder, and it recently raised its stake in the coal miner to 24.2 percent from 21.7. On Thursday, International Coal Ventures said it had hired Citibank to advise on a possible counteroffer. The battle for Riversdale, which has rich coal reserves in Mozambique, is heating up. On Thursday, Rio Tinto raised its offer for Riversdale by 6 percent, to 16 Australian dollars a share. Although Riverdaleâs board backed the bid, the stock has continued to trade above the offer price as investors anticipate a higher bid.  In addition to International Coal Ventures, Anglo American and Tata Steel are also reported to be potential bidders. On Monday, a Tata Steel executive told reporters in India that the company had not determined whether it would make a bid for Riversdale, according to Reuters. Advertisement
