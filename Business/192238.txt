Mentor Graphics pushed investors on Tuesday to vote against a proposal by its largest shareholder, Carl C. Icahn.  Mr. Icahn, who owns nearly 12 percent of the company, announced plans in February to nominate three directors to the Mentor Graphics board and threatened a proxy fight, saying the company should be put up for sale. A few weeks later, he said he was ready to offer $17 a share for Mentor Graphics in an effort to flush out potentially higher takeover bids. Shares of the company, which specializes in electronic design automation, closed at $15.28 on Monday. On Tuesday, the board of directors took an aggressive stance against Mr. Icahn in two regulatory filings, “strongly” urging shareholders to reject Mr. Icahn’s proposals as well as any others not recommended or already put in place by the board.  “Your vote will be especially important at this year’s annual meeting of shareholders,” the board said in the statement. “The Icahn Entities are attempting to replace your directors, who have supported Mentorâs successful strategy, with nominees who have, in our opinion, preconceived notions of what is right for you and who do not have the collective knowledge, skill and experience of your current board of directors.”  As part of its effort, the company highlighted its recent results. Revenue in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31 rose 49 percent, to $914.8 million, the company noted. It also posted profit of 25 cents a share, compared with a loss of 23 cents a share in the previous fiscal year. The stock was up 70 percent in the 12 months through Feb. 18, the day before Mr. Icahn announced his takeover bid.  “Your company is achieving outstanding results because we have consistently followed a strategy of maintaining rigorous control of costs and balancing investment over time with short term performance,” Mentor Graphics said. “This strategy is working. We are confident it is the right strategy to further enhance shareholder value.” In a separate regulatory filing, the board revealed that it had changed its bylaws in a direct response to the hostile overtures of Mr. Icahn. Among other moves, the company opted to set the minimum size of the board at five directors and to limit the ability to “alter the frequency” of elections. Before, the company could “change the number, term and qualification of directors at its discretion.” Advertisement
