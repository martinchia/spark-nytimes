In a rare move for bankers, Oswald Gruebel is giving up his bonus, again.  Mr. Gruebel, the chief executive of UBS, the giant Swiss bank, revealed Friday that he would forgo his bonus for the second year in a row, even though the lender returned to profitability.  Mr. Gruebel âwants to make further progress toward achieving the long-term goals set out in the firm’s strategy and therefore create further value for shareholders, as expressed in the firm’s share price,â the bank said. âThe fact that the share price did not increase in 2010 has led to Mr Gruebel’s decision.â UBS shares rose 6.17 percent, to $16.47 in 2010. During the year, the stock breached $18 briefly and fell as low as $12.54. The bank said that Mr. Gruebel was contractually entitled to a bonus in 2010, given the companyâs financial performance. But he opted only to receive his base salary of 3 million Swiss francs, the same level as last year. The bank reported last month that it had earned net profit of 7.2 billion Swiss francs last year, up from 2.7 billion Swiss francs in 2009. UBS said at the time that it was reducing its bonus pool by 10 percent to 4.3 billion francs. Like many banks, UBS is conflicted over compensation. The bank is under pressure from the Swiss government and public over pay practices after receiving a bailout from Bern in 2008. But it is also struggling to keep top employees. Advertisement
