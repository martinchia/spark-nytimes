What small-business owners think. As he explains in a small-business guide we have just published, Clint Smith, co-founder and chief executive of Emma, a Web-based marketing and communications firm, had a moment of realization three years ago when his team attended the annual South by Southwest Music and Media conference in Austin, Tex. Suddenly, Mr. Smith knew that Emma had to re-think its platform and its products. Started in 2002 and based in Nashville, Emma had grown quickly. By 2010, it had 90 full-time employees and a client roster of 30,000. It had passed $10 million in sales, but the company’s hardware system had been built before the cloud even existed, and it was showing signs of strain. âIt became fairly obvious that we had to do something,â Mr. Smith said. But how do you change everything while continuing to service your clients? Please read the guide to see how Emma managed to cope. And then tell us if you have experienced anything similar and how you handled it. You're the Boss offers an insider's perspective on small-business ownership.
