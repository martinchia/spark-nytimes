LONDON â The London Stock Exchange said on Thursday that it was on track to complete its acquisition of Russell Investments, the owner of the Russell 2000 stock market index, before the end of the year. In June, the exchange agreed to acquire Russell Investments for $2.7 billion in cash as part of a push into the United States. Shareholders approved the deal in September. The L.S.E. said on Thursday that it had received approval from the competition authorities to proceed with the Russell acquisition, and that it expected to complete the deal âwithin the next few weeks.â âFollowing completion, the all-important U.S. market will represent around one-third of our revenues,â Xavier Rolet, the chief executive of the London Stock Exchange, said in a news release. âThe group remains well positioned to develop across a wide range of businesses and markets.â The announcement came as the stock exchange said operating profit rose 14 percent to 172.3 million pounds, or about $273.5 million, in the first half of its financial year, which ended Sept. 30. That compared with Â£151 million in the period a year earlier. Revenue in its primary market business, from initial public offerings, increased 21 percent in the first half, primarily driven by strong I.P.O. activity in the first quarter. L.S.E.-owned markets in Britain and Italy had 126 new offerings in the first half of the year, compared with 79 in the period a year earlier. The offerings on L.S.E. markets raised Â£27.5 billion in the first half. Over all, revenue from the exchange’s capital markets business rose 13 percent to Â£164.6 million in the first six months of its fiscal year. The London exchange said it has a âgood pipeline of companiesâ interested in listing their shares, despite volatile conditions in the capital markets that contributed to a slowdown this year in initial public offerings. One positive sign of a return of the I.P.O. market came on Thursday, when Virgin Money, the British financial services company, listed its shares on the London exchange. Advertisement
