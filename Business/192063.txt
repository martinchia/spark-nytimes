I probably could have written an entire column on the question of whether Costco or Amazon.com’s Subscribe & Save program is the more environmentally friendly choice. Instead, I gave it a brief mention in my column this weekend.  So here’s where you come in. How would you attempt to break down the analysis? Is an Amazon subscription greener, since the company has no stores where it has to keep the lights and the heat on? Or is it better to drive to Costco a few times each year to stock up, thus avoiding all the cardboard boxes that often come with Amazon purchases? Doug Herrington, vice president of consumables at Amazon, tried to frame it this way: It’s the difference between your several-thousand-pound vehicle lumbering up the road to a warehouse store vs. letting your small package carpool with others on a U.P.S. truck.  But you know what he wants you to think. So which choice do you think is greener?
