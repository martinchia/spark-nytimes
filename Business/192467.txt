Citigroup announced on Wednesday that Duncan P. Hennes, a longtime financial executive, would join its board.  In 2006, Mr. Hennes co-founded Atrevida Partners, an investment advisory firm based in Rye, N.Y., that specializes in alternative assets. He will serve on the risk management and finance committees of the boards of both Citigroup and Citibank.  A former treasurer of Bankers Trust, Mr. Hennes, 56,  also served as chief executive of George Soros’s hedge fund company, Soros Fund Management, from 1999 until 2001. After that, he, along with Eugene Ludwig, helped found the Promontory Financial Group, the bank consulting firm. He continues to serve on Promontory’s advisory board. While at Bankers Trust, Mr. Hennes represented the bank in the consortium that rescued and took over Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, when the hedge fund nearly collapsed. He was elected chairman of the consortium’s board. Mr. Hennes is a certified public accountant and has an M.B.A. from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. âMr. Hennes has broad experience in financial services with notable expertise in securities markets and risk management,” Citigroup’s chairman, Michael E. O’Neill, said in a statement. ” We look forward to the insight he will bring to the board.” A version of this article appears in print on 12/12/2013, on page B5 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Citi's Board.
