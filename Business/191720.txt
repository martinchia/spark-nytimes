HONG KONG–Short-sellers have a number of tools at  their disposal when seeking to profit  from a drop in a target companyâs share  price. But Friday, Muddy Waters Research,  the short-seller founded by Carson C.  Block, introduced an unusual twist in its  battle against the Singapore agricultural commodity company Olam International: an offer to pay for Olam to get its  debt rated by Standard & Poorâs.  ââWe hereby make a bona fide offer to  pay for Olam to have one of its public  debt issues rated by S.&P.,ââ Muddy Waters said in a statement published on its  Web site and circulated via e-mail.  The latest volley from Muddy Waters,  the short-seller based in the United  States and Hong Kong, followed another week of testy exchanges between  Muddy Waters and Olam.  The war of words started Nov. 19,  when Mr. Block, in a speech in London,  questioned Olamâs accounting and the  sustainability of its debt load. Olam responded by temporarily halting trading  in its shares and filing a defamation lawsuit in Singapore High Court against  Muddy Waters and Mr. Block. Last Monday, the short-seller published a 135-page report that likened  Olam to Enron, an American company that  went bankrupt in 2001, saying the Singapore company was ââlikely to failââ and  questioning the bookkeeping on its acquisition of a flour milling business in  Nigeria, among other issues.  Two days later,  Olam responded with  a 45-page report of its own that dismissed the findings of Muddy Waters as  ââfalse and misleading.ââ Olam said it  faced no risk of insolvency and elaborated at length on the valuation and performance of its many trading and operating businesses around the world. It said  the short-seller was trying to ââdistract and create panicââ among its shareholders and bondholders, something it  called ââa strategy of shouting fire in a  crowded room.ââ In its statement Friday, Muddy Waters  said Olamâs allegations were defamatory. ââThe shares we have shorted are a  fraction of the number of shares short,ââ  the statement said. ââWe are not working  in concert with a group of hedge funds to  try to drive the stock price down.ââ Muddy Waters added that its offer to  pay for the debt rating would expire on Wednesday.  Representatives for Olam did not immediately respond on Friday to requests for comment. Advertisement
