MF Global is in bankruptcy court again on Friday, one day after the failed brokerage’s chief executive, Jon S. Corzine, testified before a congressional panel about the girm’s demise.  Lawyers for James W. Giddens, the trustee winding down MF Global’s trading unit are seeking court permission to return an additional $2.1 billion in customer money. Should that be approved, Mr. Giddens will have returned to clients about two-thirds of their accounts.
