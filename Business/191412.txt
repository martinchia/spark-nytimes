Western Digital has secured antitrust approval  from the European Commission for its $4.3 billion acquisition  of Hitachi‘s hard drive unit, after agreeing to sell some production assets. Under the terms of its agreement with the regulator, Western Digital agreed to sell assets like a factory and patents related to the manufacture of 3.5-inch hard drives. The deal with HitachiÂ will not close until Western Digital finds a buyer for the assets. In its finding, the European Commission said the concessions would ensure that the merger would not harm competition in the hard drive market. Without the concessions, the market for 3.5-inch hard drives would be dominated by Western Digital and Seagate Technology, which recently acquired Samsung’s hard drive unit.  “The proposed divestiture will ensure that competition in the industry is fully restored before the merger is implemented,” JoaquÃ­n Almunia, the commission’s top competition official, said in a statement.
