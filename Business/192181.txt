Valeant Phamaraceuticals International, Canada’s biggest drug maker, said on Thursday that Cephalon shareholders have until May 12 to accept its offer of $73 a share in cash. Valeant announced last month that it was taking its $5.7 billion offer directly to shareholders after being rebuffed several times by Cephalon.  In a letter to Cephalon shareholders, J. Michael Pearson, the chief executive of Valeant, said that his company’s offer represented a 29 percent premium to Cephalon’s 30-day trading average.  “And we are prepared to increase it modestly,” he said, if Valeant is permitted to examine Cephalon’s books and find greater value.  Cephalon has contended that Valeant’s offer “significantly undervalues the company,” especially the potential value from its drugs in pain, oncology, immunology and regenerative medicine.  In making the case for Valeant’s offer, Mr. Pearson added: If we do not receive consents from holders of greater than 50 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock by May 12, 2011, we intend to withdraw our offer and pursue other opportunities.
 In a statement, Cephalon said that its shareholders had “no obligation to respond to this deadline.”  “Valeant has no duty to act in the best interests of Cephalon’s shareholders, but rather for Valeant shareholders and their interests â such as buying Cephalon at the lowest possible price,” Cephalon said.
