HONG KONG â Shares in the Tianhe Chemicals Group rose on Friday in their trading debut in Hong Kong after the company raised about $650 million last week in an initial public offering. Tianhe became enmeshed in a bribery investigation this year into the hiring practices of Wall Street banks, after JPMorgan removed itself from a potentially lucrative underwriting role in the company’s share sale. The bank, one of several being investigated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission over whether the practice of hiring the children of China’s political and business elite was directly linked to winning deals, previously employed the daughter of Tianhe’s chairman. The woman, Wei Jiao, also known as Joyce Wei, subsequently moved last October to UBS, which was also acting as an underwriter on Tianhe’s I.P.O. UBS placed two bankers on suspension in February during an internal investigation into the hiring of Ms. Wei and its role in the deal. One of those bankers has since left the bank, which retained its underwriting role. Tianhe, which makes lubricant additives, previously sought to raise as much as $1 billion. Instead, the I.P.O. raised 5.07 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $654 million, after it priced its shares last week At 1.80 Hong Kong dollars — near the bottom of the marketed range of 1.75 Hong Kong dollars to 2.25 Hong Kong dollars apiece. In its first day of trading, the stock rose as high as 1.89 Hong Kong dollars on Friday morning, a gain of 5 percent. In addition to UBS, the other three lead underwriters on the I.P.O. are Morgan Stanley, whose Asian private equity business invested $300 million in Tianhe two years ago; Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit; and Goldman Sachs.
