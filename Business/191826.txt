8:45 p.m. | Updated   A former executive at a research firm pleaded guilty on Tuesday to illegally passing secret information about public companies to hedge fund clients in exchange for money, representing another victory for the government in its pursuit of insider trading on Wall Street. The executive, Don Ching Trang Chu, was the first defendant charged by federal prosecutors in the latest round of its insider trading investigation, which has focused on the expert network industry. Expert networks, which connect investors like hedge funds with executives at publicly traded companies for a fee, have come under intense scrutiny from regulators examining whether consultants have illegally disclosed nonpublic information to clients. Mr. Chuâs arrest in November, which came on the heels of several raids at hedge funds, was the beginning of what has been a months-long effort to ferret out wrongdoing in the expert network industry. At the time, Mr. Chu, 57, was an executive at Primary Global Research specializing in the technology industry. He was described on the companyâs Web site as a âbridge to Asia experts and data sources.â Mr. Chuâs sentencing is set for Sept. 7 in Federal District Court in Manhattan. He faces up to 25 years in prison from his conviction for securities fraud. So far, the government has charged 13 people associated with expert network firms; including Mr. Chu, nine have pleaded guilty. Mr. Chu read a brief statement in court late Tuesday, admitting that he connected hedge fund clients with consultants who disclosed important confidential information. âI understood that the P.G.R. clients intended to use that information in connection with the purchase or sale of securities by the hedge funds for which they worked,â he said. In addition to ensnaring consultants and hedge fund managers, the investigation has brought down firms as well. Several hedge funds, including Level Global Investors, shut down in the wake of federal raids after investors demanded their money back. Primary Global has since shuttered its office, although a spokesman has said the firm has not closed down. The investigation has also ensnared several hedge fund managers as the focus has shifted from the expert networks to their hedge fund clients. A number of managers have already pleaded guilty, including two former employees of the prominent hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors. One of those employees, Noah Freeman, testified this week as a government witness at the trial of Winifred Jiau, another former employee of Primary Global, who was charged with passing illegal tips to a number of investors, including Mr. Freeman. Mr. Chu was accused of arranging to pass along private information about such companies as Broadcom and Atheros to his hedge fund clients, who used the illicit tips to make money. Among those clients was Richard C.B. Lee, another former employee of SAC and the founder of Spherix Capital, a California-based hedge fund, who began cooperating with authorities in their investigation in 2009. In the summer of 2009, Mr. Chu arranged a call between Mr. Lee and an employee of Advanced Micro Devices. During the call, the executive dished up a range of financial data ahead of the companyâs earnings, including revenue and gross margin numbers. The following month, in August, Mr. Lee and Mr. Chu met in person. Mr. Lee told him that the numbers that the technology company employee had given him were âspot onâ and wondered whether Mr. Chu was ever ânervous,â according to the original complaint filed against Mr. Chu. Later, Mr. Chu admitted that he was and said he did not like conducting business in the United States.  He said that in Asia regulators “canât do too much,â the complaint says.  Advertisement
