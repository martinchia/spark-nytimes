With the collapse in oil prices weighing on the energy sector, the Carlyle Group suffered declines in its energy investments in the fourth quarter of 2014. Carlyle, the big private equity firm in Washington, said on Friday that a group of its energy funds fell 17 percent in the quarter as publicly traded investments in that portfolio declined. The sharp movement in oil prices â which peaked last June and continued falling through the last part of 2014 â has put pressure on a range of companies in the energy sector. Some private equity firms, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, have recorded losses on their investments, while others, like the Blackstone Group, are seeking to profit on the turmoil. For Carlyle, which reported a 7 percent increase in its private equity funds in the fourth quarter, the struggles of its energy holdings contributed to an overall appreciation of just 1 percent during the period. The hardest hit segment, known as legacy energy, includes funds that were raised by another firm, Riverstone Holdings;  Carlyle owns a stake in these funds. That portfolio includes shares of USA Compression, a compression service provider, which were down 32 percent in the quarter; and shares of Northern Blizzard Resources, a Canadian oil company that lost half its value in the quarter. In addition, Carlyle reported a quarterly decline of 8 percent in its natural resources segment, which includes investments related to energy and power. Carlyle noted, however, that its ownership stakes in its various strategies vary. For example, it generally owns a larger interest in its private equity funds than it does in its energy funds, making it less vulnerable to declines in energy. The funds included in the report, known as âcarry funds,â are ones that have appreciated enough for Carlyle to start collecting profit from them. Advertisement
