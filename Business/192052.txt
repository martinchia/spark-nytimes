 Boeing said on Friday that it had discovered tiny cracks in the wings of about 40 Dreamliners currently in production. It was the latest setback for the advanced airliner, though the plane maker said it was confident the problem did not involve any of the 787s in service. Boeing said it was recently informed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which makes the carbon composite wings in Japan, that a change in their manufacturing process caused hairline cracks in a limited number of shear ties on a wing rib. Fixing each plane could take one to two weeks, the company said, and might result in some delivery delays. Still, the plane maker expects to meet its overall delivery goals for 2014, said a Boeing spokesman, Marc Birtel. Boeing has been ramping up production and now assembles 10 787s a month at two factories, in Everett, Wash., and in North Charleston, S.C. It plans to deliver 110 787s this year. “We understand the issue, what must be done to correct it, and are completing inspections of potentially affected airplanes,” the company said. “We are addressing affected airplanes as required.” The problem does not affect any of the 123 787s delivered since 2011, the company said. Boeing has outsourced much of the manufacturing of the 787s. Japanese companies account for about a third of the total. The plane, which relies heavily on advanced technology and lightweight carbon composite materials, has suffered from a series of malfunctions and mishaps, including two incidents involving its lithium-ion batteries that led to the fleet’s grounding for three months early last year.
