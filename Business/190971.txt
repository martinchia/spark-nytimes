LONDON â HSBC said on Thursday that its chairman for Europe, Alexander Andrew Flockhart, who is known as Sandy, has decided to retire after 37 years at the bank. Mr. Flockhart, 60, will step down as an executive director at the end of April but will stay on HSBCâs board as a nonexecutive director, the bank said in a statement. He joined HSBC in 1974 as a graduate trainee. A year later, he moved to the United Arab Emirates, and later served as senior executive in Mexico, Thailand, Malaysia, the United States and Qatar. He was also previously chief executive of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.  “He retires at a point in time when commercial banking, the business with which he has been most associated, is the largest profit contributor to the group,â Douglas Flint, HSBCâs chairman, said in a statement. âThe board and I are extremely pleased that Sandy has agreed to stay on as a nonexecutive director so that we will be able to continue to draw on his depth of experience.” Mr. Flockhart will receive a directorâs fee of Â£95,000 ($102,800) a year. His initial appointment as nonexecutive director is for one year, after which he is subject to election by shareholders. Advertisement
