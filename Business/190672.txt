Dr. Joel S. Ross took the witness stand for a second day at the insider trading trial of Mathew Martoma, a former hedge fund manager at SAC Capital Advisors. During his testimony, Dr. Ross told the jury of seven men and five women how Mr. Martoma knew so much detail about a confidential presentation on a clinical drug trial that Dr. Ross had attended, âit was like he was in the room with me,â Alexandra Stevenson reports in DealBook. The presentation detailed results of a clinical trial for an Alzheimerâs drug, which were not made public until the following day. The shares of the companies developing the drug, Elan and Wyeth, fell sharply when news of the disappointing outcome surfaced. The government contends that Mr. Martomaâs advance knowledge of the clinical trialâs failure helped SAC avoid losses and generate profits of $276 million for the firm. Mr. Martomaâs lawyers tried to cast doubt on Dr. Rossâs motives, questioning whether the doctor had suffered financially because of Mr. Martomaâs indictment. Dr. Ross answered that he had lost business after his name became associated with Mr. Martomaâs.

YAHOO FIRES NO. 2 EXECUTIVE Â |Â  Marissa Mayer, the chief executive of Yahoo, fired Henrique de Castro, her No. 2 executive, on Wednesday, only slightly more than a year after she had lured him from Google to help her transform the once-robust company, Vindu Goel reports in The New York Times.
