The planned initial public offering of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth, has Wall Street buzzing. But investing in the tech behemoth carries a number of risks. The prospectus for the I.P.O., which was filed on Tuesday, contains 38 pages outlining many of the risks that the company is disclosing to would-be investors. Such disclosures are fairly standard, intended to insulate companies from shareholder lawsuits if the investments go sour. But others are particular to Alibaba and reflect a different set of corporate governance standards than those at many American firms. Among the many risks listed, prospective investors are warned about the Chinese government, Alibaba’s corporate structure and even the threat of a natural disaster. A few of the notable risk factors outlined include: * Because it is a foreign company, Alibaba plans to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements under the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. For example, the company said it was not required to have a majority of its board be independent, to have a compensation committee made up of independent directors or to adopt and disclose a code of ethics for directors and officers. * Alibaba also said that it did not have to file reports and financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission “as frequently or as promptly” as American companies. “As a result, our shareholders may be afforded less protection than they would under the Exchange Act rules applicable to domestic U.S. companies,” the prospectus said. The e-commerce company has seized investor and public interest to an extent that is unusual for a company that does much of its business in China. * The company notes that the “Alibaba Partnership,” which includes members of management, will have the right to nominate a majority of the company’s directors. And two major shareholders, SoftBank and Yahoo, are expected to agree to vote their shares in favor of the partnership’s nominees at each annual meeting. “This governance structure and contractual arrangement will limit your ability to influence corporate matters, including any matters determined at the board level,” the prospectus said. * The company conducts business through complex investment vehicles known as variable interest entities, which allow it to accept money from foreign investors through offshore entities. The practice is common in China, Alibaba said, but the government “may not agree that these arrangements comply” with “licensing, registration or other regulatory requirements, with existing policies or with requirements or policies that may be adopted in the future.” * The variable interest entities could also introduce other complications, including conflicts of interest among board members. Jack Ma, the executive chairman, is the majority owner of a large number of these vehicles, the prospectus said. “Conflicts of interests may arise due to dual roles both as directors and executive officers of the variable interest entities and as directors of our company, and may also arise due to dual roles both as variable interest entity equity holders and as directors of our company,” it said. * Investors may be buying shares in the United States yet may have to answer to the taxman in China. If Alibaba is deemed a “resident enterprise” in China, then dividends or gains on its common shares would be subject to taxation by Chinese authorities, the prospectus said. * Alibaba relies on Alipay, its payment processing affiliate, which handled 78.6 percent of the gross merchandise volume in its retail markets in China last year. But Alipay is subject to regulatory risks, Alibaba said. “Regulators and third parties in China have been increasing their focus on online and mobile payment services, such as those provided by Alipay, and recent regulatory and other developments could reduce the convenience or utility of Alipay usersâ accounts,” the prospectus said. * Any investor in Alibaba is putting faith in China’s Internet infrastructure, which is tightly controlled by the country’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. “We may not have access to alternative networks in the event of disruptions, failures or other problems with Chinaâs Internet infrastructure,” the prospectus said. “In addition, the Internet infrastructure in China may not support the demands associated with continued growth in Internet usage.” * Alibaba said it could be scrutinized under an anti-monopoly law in China that took effect in 2008. Two enforcement agencies regulating monopolies “have in recent years strengthened enforcement actions, including levying significant fines, with respect to cartel activity as well as abusive behavior of companies having market dominance,” the prospectus said. * The company is heavily exposed to any economic slowdown in China. The Chinese government, the prospectus said, “has in recent years implemented a number of measures to control the rate of economic growth.” * Alibaba said that audits by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which prepared the audit report included in the prospectus, are not subject to full inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board because Alibaba does most of its business in China. Being deprived of these inspections may cause shareholders to “lose confidence in our reported financial information and procedures and the quality of our financial statements,â the company said.
