Morgan Stanley has sold its mortgage servicing company, a deal that will net the Wall Street firm $59.3 million in cash. The Ocwen Financial Corporation, which bought the unit, Saxon Mortgage Services, has also agreed to pay Morgan Stanley $1.4 billion for servicing outstanding receivables.   Morgan Stanley bought Saxon in 2006 for more than $700 million when the mortgage boom was in the full force. This market has all but dried up and Morgan Stanley and other firms have been selling these divisions in recent years.  In June, Ocwen, which is based in West Palm Beach, Fla.,  bought Goldman Sachsâ€™ mortgage unit, Litton Loan Servicing, for $263.7 million Saxon agreed earlier this year to pay $2.35 million  to resolve allegations that it wrongly foreclosed on several members of the military from 2006 to June 2009.
