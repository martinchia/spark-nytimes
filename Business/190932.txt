The Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Tuesday closed the chapter on another part of the financial crisis, selling mortgage bonds with a face value of about $6 billion to Credit Suisse. The sale effectively signals the end of Maiden Lane II, one of two investment vehicles the New York Fed set up to house risky investments the government had acquired from the American International Group.  The sale Tuesday will pay down a $19.5 billion loan from the government backing Maiden Lane II, and will generate about $2.8 billion in proceeds for taxpayers, according to the New York Fed. The regulator did not disclose other details about the sale. âThe completion of the sale of the Maiden Lane II portfolio has resulted in significant gains for the public and marks an important milestone in the wind-down of the extraordinary interventions necessitated by the financial crisis,â William C. Dudley, the New York Fed’s president, said in a statement. The New York Fed purchased the securities as part of A.I.G.’s $182 billion government bailout in 2008, creating two investment vehicles named after the street that runs behind the bank’s headquarters in lower Manhattan. Maiden Lane II consisted of about $20.5 billion worth of bonds tied to subprime mortgages that had rapidly soured as the housing market collapsed. A.I.G., sensing that the bonds were poised for a rebound in value, made a $15.7 billion bid for the entire portfolio last year. But the New York Fed rebuffed the offer and instead sought to auction off the investments. Though it found some acceptable bids last year, the New York Fed tried again last month after receiving an unsolicited bid from Goldman Sachs. Credit Suisse won that auction, buying securities with a face value of about $7 billion. A.I.G. later purchased some Maiden Lane II bonds worth about $2 billion. The auction on Tuesday was prompted by an unsolicited offer by Morgan Stanley, and drew in Credit Suisse, Barclays Capital, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the Royal Bank of Scotland as other bidders.
