When eBay announced on Tuesday that it would spin off PayPal as a separate public company, the news sent ripples through the payments industry. Here would be a way for investors to bet on a revolution, one that would upend the traditional payments system now seen by many as cumbersome and expensive. A closer look at PayPalâs numbers, however, suggest that the old order is far from done, DealBookâs Peter Eavis writes. Sure, PayPal processed $180 billion in payments last year, but technology investors may be yearning for more progress. One analyst said that while PayPal had stronger growth than companies like Visa and MasterCard, it had weaker profit margins. The cost of expanding its network has also saddled PayPal with proportionately higher expenses than established payment companies. And a potential competitive threat from Apple Pay, a technology that could make it easier to pay for things with an iPhone, has also dimmed PayPalâs prospects. Still, PayPalâs business has one big advantage over credit card companies, and even Apple Pay. Transactions through PayPal have far lower processing fees, making them more attractive for merchants, who pay the fees. The challenge for PayPal now is finding ways to exploit these lower fees. And even that may not be enough to draw customers away from the traditional payments system. PayPalâs success may depend on producing a technology that is easier to use than a credit card or debit card, Mr. Eavis writes. And Apple Pay, with its iPhone fingerprint authorization, may catch on quickly, making it harder for PayPal to compete. âIn other words, PayPal may be the only big disrupter in this battle,â Mr. Eavis writes. âThat is sure to get investors intrigued when its stock starts to trade. But it is precisely the thing that could make it a risky bet.â  WINNERS IN PAYPALâS SPINOFF  |  Who came out ahead in eBayâs planned spinoff of PayPal? Carl C. Icahn certainly has little complaint. Indeed, eBayâs decision was one that Mr. Icahn had advocated all along. On Tuesday, Mr. Icahn publicly praised eBayâs move, even if he could not help but add that he believed the decision came âa little laterâ than it should have, Michael J. de la Merced writes. And Mr. Icahn isnât the only billionaire with a stake in eBayâs fate. Third Point, the hedge fund run by Daniel S. Loeb, has also amassed a position in the companyâs shares. Mr. Loeb is pleased with the PayPal decision, according to a person briefed on the matter. Goldman Sachs emerged a winner as well. The bank, which leads the Thomson Reuters list of spinoff advisers, was among the advisers to eBay on its proposed breakup. By most of the relevant ways to slice the data, Goldman ends up on top when it comes to the business of breaking up companies.  DARDENâS STICKY SITUATION  |  For almost a year, Darden Restaurants, the owner of Olive Garden and Red Lobster, has paid a steep price for refusing to meet the demands of two activist investors, Starboard Value and the Barington Capital Group, Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor column. Clarence Otis Jr., Dardenâs chief executive and chairman, announced in July that he was resigning, eight of Dardenâs directors have agreed to step down, and the four remaining board members are trying desperately to keep their seats. How did the Darden board allow the situation to get to this point? Much can be traced to Dardenâs decision to spin off Red Lobster, but not Olive Garden, as a stand-alone company. Though Starboard had initially proposed spinning off Olive Garden, Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakhouse into a company separate from Dardenâs higher-growth chains like Capital Grille, shareholders protested Dardenâs maneuver. But before the shareholder meeting on the spinoff, Dardenâs board agreed abruptly in May to sell Red Lobster for $2.1 billion to Golden Gate Capital. Starboard complained that the deal was at a fire sale price, eventually prompting the investor to try to replace Dardenâs directors. Dardenâs board has been on the appeasement trail ever since. âWe will most likely never know what caused the board to take this inexplicable path,â Mr. Davidoff Solomon writes. âAbsent a last-minute, face-saving compromise, the likelihood of a full-scale ouster raises the glaring question: Why would the board pointlessly and perhaps foolishly invite its own demise?â   ON THE AGENDA  |  The ADP private payroll report is out at 8:15 a.m. Gallupâs job creation index is released at 8:30 a.m. The Markit purchasing managersâ manufacturing index comes out at 9:45 a.m. The ISM manufacturing composite index is released at 10 a.m. Data on construction spending is out at 10 a.m.  2 ACCUSED OF INSIDER TRADING ON HERBALIFE  |  Herbalife is back in the spotlight. On Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused two friends of possessing confidential information about plans by the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management to attack Herbalife, DealBookâs Ben Protess and Alexandra Stevenson write. The case against the two men, Filip Szymik and Jordan Peixoto, puts a twist on the typical investigation into leaks of confidential information. It also sets an aggressive tone not only for a broader investigation surrounding Herbalife, but also in how the S.E.C. pursues insider trading. Problems began for Mr. Szymik in 2012, when he learned from his roommate, a junior employee at William A. Ackmanâs hedge fund, that Mr. Ackman was planning to announce a bearish view of Herbalife. Mr. Szymik then shared this insight with Mr. Peixoto, another friend, who placed his own bet against Herbalife. When Mr. Ackman announced a $1 billion bet against Herbalife, a move that sent the companyâs stock plummeting, Mr. Peixoto reaped $47,100 in illicit profits. Mr. Szymik has settled the case, but Mr. Peixoto has not. Mr. Peixotoâs lawyer argued that âthis is another instance of the S.E.C. going too far and penalizing somebody for conduct that is not a violation of the law.â Of all the angles the government has pursued in the long-running Herbalife investigation, the case against Mr. Szymik and Mr. Peixoto was the least expected, Mr. Protess and Ms. Stevenson write. But it was the first, and could be the only one, to be filed in a drawn-out conflict that has captivated Wall Street. The case does not read like the average insider trading action, either. Most important, legal experts say that the S.E.C. has never before filed a case citing an activist hedge fundâs bet as an insider secret.    |  Contact: @melbournecoal | E-mail  Sign up for the DealBook Newsletter, delivered every morning and afternoon.   Johnson & Johnson to Buy Biotech Company Alios BioPharma  |  The $1.75 billion deal for Alios BioPharma, which is working on treatments for viral diseases, is the first acquisition in some time for Johnson & Johnson.
