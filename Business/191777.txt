Moelis & Company said on Tuesday that it had hired Alexandra Oldroyd as a London-based managing director and specialist in food and beverage companies. The hiring is the latest by the boutique investment bank as it seeks to expand globally. The firm has had an especially keen desire to expand its offices in Europe and the Middle East. Ms. Oldroyd was most recently at Barclays Capital, where she was an analyst covering European beverage companies. She previously worked at Morgan Stanley and SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale. She will work alongside Benoit Renon, a managing director in Moelis’s European consumer team. “With nearly two decades of experience in the consumer industry, Alex has established an impressive global portfolio of senior relationships across the sector,” Mark Aedy, Moelis’s head of European, Middle Eastern and Asian banking, said in a statement. “She brings deep institutional knowledge and strategic insights to the consumer practice, which will enhance our consumer franchise globally.” Advertisement
