 CITIGROUP FAILS FED STRESS TEST  |  For the second time in three years, the Federal Reserve rejected Citigroupâs plans to manage its capital, an embarrassing blow that could derail the plans of Michael Corbat, the bankâs chief executive, to rehabilitate the bank, Michael Corkery writes in DealBook. Citigroup was the only one of the nationâs top five banks that failed to persuade the Fed to bless its plans for shareholder payouts. The Fed did not give many details behind its rejection in a report released on Wednesday, but did cite concerns about the bankâs financial projections for its sprawling operations. It also denied the bankâs plan to increase dividends and repurchase stock. The Fedâs rebuke was particularly notable not only because most of Citigroupâs large peers had their plans accepted, but also because the bankâs capital cushion â a key measure of a bankâs strength â comfortably exceeded the regulatory minimum.  The Fedâs decision is already stirring calls to break up Citiâs far-flung business, echoing concerns voiced by investors and analysts after the discovery of a $400 million fraud in the Citigroupâs Mexican unit last month. The Fedâs action is also prompting calls for changes at the top of the bankâs management. In addition to Citigroup, the Fed rejected the capital plans of the American units of three international banks: HSBC, Santander of Spain and the Royal Bank of Scotland, which operates under the Citizens Bank brand in the United States.  The Fed approved the capital plans of 25 other banks,  including those of Bank of America, which  announced a dividend increase for the first time since 2009. The bank also agreed on Wednesday to pay $6.3 billion to settle a lawsuit arising out of troubled mortgage-backed securities it put together and sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before the financial crisis, Matthew Goldstein writes in DealBook. The conclusion came on the same day as Bank of America and its former chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, reached a deal to resolve another lawsuit arising from the financial crisis.  

 KING CHIEF LOOKS AHEAD AFTER DISAPPOINTING STOCK DEBUT  |  Though his companyâs stock slumped nearly 16 percent on its first day of public trading, Riccardo Zacconi, the chief executive and co-founder of King Digital Entertainment â which makes the popular game Candy Crush Saga â remained confident about his companyâs long-term value. But the drop in Kingâs stock, which closed at $19 a share, nevertheless disappointed investors, William Alden writes in DealBook. Kingâs performance was the worst first-day performance of an initial public offering so far this year. 
With the popularity of Candy Crush already on the decline, King has insisted that its other games are gaining users. But the big question for investors now is whether the company, which derives 78 percent of its total gross bookings from a single game, is more than a one-hit wonder. Kingâs future growth depends on its ability to build on its Candy Crush success. For his part, Mr. Zacconi said he was ânot focused on the short term,â and was “looking forward to getting back to work in the studio.“



LAW FIRMS PRESSED TO TIGHTEN CYBER SECURITY  |  As global concerns about hacker threats rise, a growing number of corporate clients, including Wall Street banks, are demanding that their law firms take more steps to guard against online intrusions that could compromise sensitive information, Matthew Goldstein writes in DealBook. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation began organizing meetings with top law firms in 2011 to highlight the problem of computer security, but companies are now taking the issue into their own hands, pressing outside law firms to prove that their computer systems are employing top-tier technologies to detect and deter online attacks. Others are asking law firms to stop putting files on portable thumb drives, emailing them to nonsecure iPads or working on computers linked to a shared network in countries like China and Russia where hacking is prevalent.
Mr. Goldstein writes: âCompanies are prodding law firms on security at a time of overall rising concern about hacker attacks like the information breach at Target last year, when the retailer said at least 40 million credit and debit card accounts were compromised. Financial regulators are also requiring banks to make sure that vendors they rely on, like law firms, are vigilant when it comes to dealing with hackers and other online intruders.â 



ON THE AGENDA  |  The pending home sales index for February is out at 10 a.m. Sandra Pianalto, the president of the Cleveland Fed, speaks at 8:30 a.m. in Dayton, Ohio. Charles L. Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed, gives a speech at 9:30 p.m. in Hong Kong. Microsoft is expected to formally unveil an iPad version of Office, the companyâs suite of software programs, in San Francisco. Benjamin M. Lawsky, New Yorkâs top banking regulator, is on CNBC at 11 a.m. The N.C.A.A. menâs basketball tournament Sweet Sixteen round begins. President Obama meets with Pope Francis at the Vatican.



REVERSE MORTGAGES MAY STING HEIRS  |  Across the country, a growing number of baby boomers are learning that their parentsâ reverse mortgages are now threatening their own inheritances, Jessica Silver-Greenberg writes in DealBook. These reverse mortgages â which allow homeowners 62 and older to borrow money against the value of their homes that do not need to be paid back until they move out or die â were supposed to help their elderly parents stay in their houses. But, as it turns out, these same loans can come up with a harsh sting for their heirs.
Under federal rules, survivors are supposed to be offered the option to settle the loan for a percentage of the full amount. But instead, reverse mortgage companies are increasingly threatening to foreclose unless heirs pay the mortgages in full. Some lenders are moving to foreclose just weeks after the borrower dies, and heirs say they are plunged into a bureaucratic mess as they try to get lenders to provide them with details about how to keep their families homes. For their part, reverse mortgage lenders argue that they are abiding by federal rules, saying their goal is to avert foreclosures. Used correctly, they say, these loans can help older homeowners get cash to pay for retirement.
Ms. Silver-Greenberg writes: âThere is no data on how many heirs are facing foreclosure because of reverse mortgages. But interviews with elder care advocates, the housing counselors and heirs, suggest that it is a growing problem already affecting an estimated tens of thousands of people. And it is one that threatens to ensnare future generations, as older Americans increasingly turn to their homes for cash.â
