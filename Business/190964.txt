The battle for Great Wolf Resorts isn’t over yet. Apollo Global Management agreed on Wednesday to raise its bid for Great Wolf, an operator of indoor water parks, to $7 a share, or $234 million, matching a bid by KSL Capital Partners. Great Wolf said that it had accepted the revised bid, leaving the fate of the bidding war to KSL. During a year in which merger activity appears to materialize in fits and starts, the prospects of a prolonged bidding fight have entranced many in the deal community. It is particularly rare to see two private equity firms battle each other over a target so publicly, given the general reluctance of buyout shops to top another announced deal. Wednesday’s announcement appears to show Apollo’s commitment to winning control of Great Wolf, after having lost out on an effort to buy another amusement park operator in 2009. Shareholders of that company, Cedar Fair, rejected the buyout firm’s $2.4 billion bid as too low. Apollo and KSL have been dueling over Great Wolf for the last two weeks. Both were finalists to buy the park company late last year. Each has raised its offer at least once. Late on Sunday, Great Wolf declared that KSL’s bid of $7 a share was the superior proposal, giving Apollo until Wednesday evening to decide whether it wanted to match it or walk away. Under the terms of Wednesday’s amended merger agreement, the termination fee and expense reimbursements that Apollo could receive if Great Wolf accepts a rival offer have risen yet again, to $9.33 million.
