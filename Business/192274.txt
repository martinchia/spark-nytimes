UNIVISION OWNERS SAID TO WEIGH A SALE  |  The owners of Univision Communications, the biggest Spanish-language broadcaster in the United States, are said to have held preliminary talks about a potential sale with media companies in recent weeks, including CBS, Time Warner and Viacom, DealBookâs Michael J. de la Merced writes. The talks were at a very early stage and no sales process is underway at the moment. Should Univisionâs owners â a consortium led by the billionaire Haim Saban â pursue a sale, they will probably expect bids to top at least $20 billion. 

A RESURGENCE IN HOSTILE ACTIVITY  |  Hostile deal-making is back, David Gelles writes in DealBook. Some of this yearâs largest takeover bids were unsolicited, including Pfizerâs $119 billion proposal to acquire AstraZeneca and Valeant Pharmaceuticalsâ continuing $53 billion hostile effort to take over Allergan. Whatâs more, several bidding wars have broken out over targets â including, most recently, Hillshire Brands â that never put themselves up for sale. 
Even excluding Pfizerâs withdrawn bid for AstraZeneca, nearly $100 billion in hostile offers have been made, accounting for 7 percent of global offer volume. That is the highest amount since the deal boom of 2007. One factor driving the increase in hostile activity is greater confidence in the boardroom. With the favorable economic environment, executives are more willing to pursue acquisitions. Targets, however, are similarly bullish, making it easy to reject suitors. 
Changes in corporate governance, too, have made it easier for shareholders to vote out an entire slate of directors at once. Poison pills, which prevent outside shareholders from attaining large positions, are less common. And the concentration of big company stock in the hands of a small number of institutional investors has made it easier for bidders to win shareholder support. Still, constraints on hostile deal-making remain, including the commitment of resources and the tough regulatory environment.



BETTING ON EMERGING MARKETS  |  Like many money managers, Justin M. Leverenz, who runs the United Statesâ largest emerging markets mutual fund at Oppenheimer Funds, is betting on unpredictable markets, Landon Thomas Jr. writes in DealBook. But few share his bullish attitude toward Turkey, in large part because of its polarizing leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and the economyâs dependence on volatile investment flows.
But Mr. Leverenz is convinced that, over the long term, Mr. Erdoganâs radical reform ambitions will transform Turkey, reflecting his broader credo that emerging nations like China, Brazil, Russia and India are experiencing economic and social change that wonât be reversed. His philosophy appears to be working. Since 2009, assets in Mr. Leverenzâs developing markets fund have soared to $41 billion, from a low of $3.9 billion. Since 2010, Mr. Leverenzâs fund is up 27 percent, outpacing more than 90 percent of his peers.
In a nod to regulatory worries over the explosion in fund assets, Oppenheimer closed Mr. Leverenzâs fund to new investors last year. Even so, Mr. Leverenzâs fund can still attract as much as $600 million a month from existing investors. Putting the money to work is one of his biggest challenges, he said, which is why he is pushing himself harder to uncover companies that both meet his exacting investment criteria and that are large enough to make a difference in his fund.

SYCAMORE TAKES AIM AT EXPRESS  |  The investment firm Sycamore Partners disclosed on Thursday that it had acquired a 9.9 percent stake in Express, the fashionable retailer that has hit a slump of late, and is interested in buying the rest of the company, DealBookâs Michael J. de la Merced writes. In a regulatory filing, Sycamore said that it had sent a letter to the Express board, seeking to conduct due diligence to help draft a formal proposal to buy the retailer. The investment firm said that it had paid $106.2 million to buy its stake.
The unsolicited approach is the latest acquisition attempt by Sycamore, which has fashioned itself as a specialist in retailers. Among the companies that the firm has purchased are the Jones Group, Talbots and Hot Topic. It also supported the spinoff of Kurt Geiger, a British seller of trendy shoes and accessories, from the Jones Group.
