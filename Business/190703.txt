Morrison & Foerster said on Monday that Howard Morris, a former co-chief executive of SNR Denton, was joining the law firm as head of the bankruptcy and restructuring group in London.  His practice will focus on cross-border and Pan-European transactions and insolvency proceedings. “The addition of Howard comes at a crucial time with significant levels of corporate debt still to be restructured across the U.K. and more widely in Europe,” Gary Lee, chairman of Morrison & Foersterâs business restructuring and insolvency group, said in a statement. Mr. Morris became a co-chief executive of SNR Denton in 2010, when the law firm was created by the merger of Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal of the United States and Denton Wilde Sapte of Britain. He left SNR Denton in September after having been with the firm or its predecessors since 1991.  A graduate of Queen Mary College, University of London in 1978, Mr. Morris qualified as a barrister in 1979 and as a solicitor in 1990. Advertisement
