Hedge funds were pretty much flat in November, although which side of zero will depend on which index you look at.  Two indexes show they went up, while a third points to a slight tick down in November, after weathering fears of Europeâ€™s sovereign credit risk and a decline in the stock market. The Dow Jones Credit Suisse Hedge Fund Index fell  0.28 percent following a nearly 2 percent gain last month, leaving the index up 7.72 percent so far this year, according to a release on Wednesday. The Henessee Hedge Fund Index, meanwhile, lifted an estimated 0.32 percent, and the Hedge Fund Research Index picked up 0.26 percent in November. All three indexes show annual gains of about 7 percent across a broad array of strategies in the industry, with equity strategies offering some of the largest gains. Advertisement
