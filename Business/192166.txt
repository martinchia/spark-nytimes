 The cost of meats, fish and eggs led last month to the biggest increase in food prices in nearly two and a half years, according to government data. An index that tracks those foods rose 1.2 percent in February and has climbed 4 percent over the last 12 months. The increases were acute for items served at breakfast. For instance, the price of lean pork in the futures market is at record levels and is up 52 percent since the start of the year, to $1.31 a pound. Traders are apparently concerned about a deadly virus — porcine epidemic diarrhea — in the United States hog population. The result could be higher prices for bacon, which were already rising after farmers cut production because of higher feed costs. The average price of a pound of sliced bacon was $5.46 in February, up from $4.83 a year earlier and $3.62 five years ago, government data shows. Coffee futures have surged 57 percent this year and this month rose above $2 a pound for the first time in two years. Coffee-growing regions of southern Brazil, the world’s largest coffee producer, have been hit by drought, and analysts say Brazil’s crop could shrink by about 20 percent this year. Orange juice futures are up, too; they climbed as high as $1.57 a pound March 6, their highest price in two years. A version of this brief appears in print on March 22, 2014, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Breakfast Items Lead a Big Jump in Food Prices.
