A third Allergan shareholder has come forward to insist that the Botox maker not agree to an all-cash acquisition that would thwart a takeover offer before a special meeting scheduled for Dec. 18.  Jackson Square Partners, which represents investors holding more than $1 billion in Allergan shares, on Saturday sent a letter to company’s board in which it questioned Allergan’s strategy and called on it to engage in deal talks with Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Pershing Square Capital Management, which are waging a hostile takeover effort. Jackson Square expressed dismay that Valeant had not engaged in deal talks with Valeant or Actavis, which had also expressed interest in a deal, and questioned why the company did not buy back its own shares when they were trading much lower last year. Jackson Square also questioned Allergan’s reported efforts to speedily acquire Salix Pharmaceuticals in an all-cash deal, which would not require shareholder approval and would most likely thwart interest by Valeant and Pershing Square and Actavis. “This approach appears to be intended to not only pre-empt shareholder approval, but also eliminate interest from the various bidders for the company,” Jackson Square said.  In its letter, Jackson Square said that Allergan “management has defended this stance by claiming that shareholder feedback has been strongly in favor of an acquisition, preferably to be completed prior to the special meeting on December 18.”   But the investor said it did not believe that claim. “That a large majority of Allergan shareholders would support such a strategy is hard to fathom, and doesn’t reflect our understanding of the situation,” Jackson Square said.  “If there are investors who feel this way, however, we want to be very clear: we are not among them,” the letter continued. “Completing an acquisition prior to the special meeting will all but eliminate Allergan’s alternatives for creating value. Limiting options is not in shareholders’ interests. We strongly urge you to fully engage all available paths, thereby ensuring value maximization.” Indeed, a review of Allergan’s investor base raises questions about how many investors could support management’s plans to strike an all-cash deal before the special meeting.  Investors holding more than 35 percent of Allergan shares have called for the special meeting, at which they will have a chance to remove a majority of the board. Pershing Square is the largest holder of Allergan shares, with nearly 10 percent. Investors with at least 25 percent of shares also support the special meeting. T. Rowe Price and Pentwater Capital Management, which together hold nearly 7 percent of shares, on Friday also called on Allergan to refrain from any deal making before the shareholder meeting. Hedge funds and other investors have bought up another substantial block of Allergan shares. Index funds, which are not likely to support a deal, are substantial holders as well. And retail and small institutional shareholders, a fragmented group, own a substantial block as well. That breakdown, with an absence of many large shareholders who have not already come out against an all-cash acquisition of Salix, is why Jackson Square says it is unlikely that a majority of shareholders support the Salix deal. Allergan responded to the growing investor protest on Friday. “We appreciate the perspectives of our stockholders,” Allergan said in a statement late on Friday. “The Allergan board has a longstanding track record of consistently acting in the best interests of Allerganâs stockholders and delivering superior performance as prudent stewards of capital. We recognize that what matters is value, and Allerganâs board remains confident in the companyâs ability to deliver significantly more value than Valeantâs grossly inadequate offer.” Advertisement
