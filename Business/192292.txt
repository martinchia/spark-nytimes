How small businesses use big data. At RJMetrics, data is king. Weâve built our business around the belief that data-driven decisions are better decisions, and weâve made it our mission to inspire and empower data driven people. But having such a deep love affair with data can be a dangerous game. The truth is that, even for companies like ours, using data is not always the best path. In fact, sometimes data can do more harm than good. Here are three situations in which Iâve learned to second-guess the data-driven approach. When the cost is too high. When building a business, time and energy will often be in short supply. This means you wonât always have the luxury of making a fully informed decision. Since collecting and analyzing data consumes resources, itâs important to weigh the benefits of a data-driven decision against its costs. If the data-driven path will cost more than the value of its potential upside, donât bother. Iâve seen this come up quite often when companies run A/B tests to optimize a website. In these cases, data is often proposed as a way to convert tough subjective decisions into seemingly objective ones. âAt long last,â says the indecisive, analytical entrepreneur, âwe can quantify whether a green button is better than the blue button by testing which color leads to more clicks! Hooray for data!â Unfortunately, the costs of running these tests can be wildly disproportionate to the relative improvements they reveal. Using A/B tests to make decisions about small details steals time from tests about much bigger, more important questions. As it turns out, testing the color of the button is foolish if you havenât tested whether the button should be there at all. In most cases, your best move is to pick a color, move on, and invest your precious resources on more meaningful issues. When I started my first web business back in 2006, I made plenty of mistakes in this area. I foolishly spent more time testing the stock photography on my homepage than I did testing the business model. Not surprisingly, the company didnât make it. When the results won’t change your mind.
 Last year, we redesigned our website. The change was part of a major rebranding that was built from the ground-up to communicate our companyâs mission, values, and place in the market. It provided a unified vision for how we thought about the world and what we were here to do. When it was time to launch, my co-founder asked a logical question: Why donât we test it against the old site to make sure it actually converts better? The costs of running such a test would be significant, including delaying the launch and creating an inconsistent experience for our prospects. But this was definitely a huge change, and didnât I just say that those are the ones that are worth testing? Ultimately, we decided not to run the side-by-side test. The reason was simple: There were no realistic outcomes that could have led us to throw out the new design. We didnât make these changes as an exercise in conversion-rate optimization. We made them as an expression of our identity, one that would lay the groundwork for how we communicate as a business. Rather than run a test that would not change our behavior, we put those resources to work testing the messaging and conversion funnel of our new design. Within days, the new siteâs conversion rates were setting company records. We never looked back. When following the data means betraying your vision. Sometimes you need to prioritize the big picture over the optimization of a single metric. These hard calls need to be made in order to stay true to your values. They serve a greater purpose than you can quantify in any single metric or analysis. When RJMetrics launched, we were self-financed and we survived month-to-month. One data point mattered above all else: cash. However, we also had a vision of building an amazing software company. We set out to build a product that would change the way thousands of businesses make decisions. It wasnât long before offers started rolling in that tested our loyalty to this vision. When our product was in its infancy, we got plenty of requests to do custom, manual data analysis. These jobs didnât require our software at all, which meant they were a distraction from our core vision. But they paid big money! If we were optimizing for cash, the data led us to a clear decision: take as many of these jobs as possible and book the revenue. Rather than let cash lead us astray, however, we took on these contracts only if the client agreed to let us use our software to do the analysis. Because the product was still being built, this required far more work than simply doing the analyses by hand. We spent more time and made less money, but we stayed true to our vision. As a result, the product got better, we got clients we could use as references, and we moved one step closer to where we are today. I owe a lot to data, and almost every important decision I make is influenced by it. Some decisions, however, are better left to your brain (or your gut). Hereâs to choosing wisely. Robert J.
