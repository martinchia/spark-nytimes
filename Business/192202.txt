Carl C. Icahn is again rolling up his sleeves and stepping into the ring. Mr. Icahn has announced plans on Tuesday to nominate at least three directors to the board of Mentor Graphics, according toÂ a regulatoryÂ filing.Â  The activist investor, who owns 16.1 million Mentor Graphics shares (or 14.7 percent of the company) has threatened to wage a proxy fight to protest the software maker’s decision to move up its annual shareholder meeting by six weeks. Under Mentor Graphics’ bylaws, the new date gave shareholders just 10 days to submit alternative board slates. “We, at that time, called the company and stated that, in light of  our  prior friendly discussions, we viewed the announcement as a hostile and unprovoked  defensive tactic intended to impede shareholder rights,” Mr. Icahn said in the filing. “This company should be acquired, or at the very least, be put up for sale,” Mr. Icahn said on CNBC on Tuesday.  Mentor Graphics has a market value of $1.6 billion.   Mr. Icahn is not the only investor to have bristled at Mentor Graphics’ revised schedule. The activist hedge fund Casablanca Capital announced this week that it may also mount a proxy fight. In a letter to Mentor Graphics’ board, the founder of Casablanca Capital, Donald G. Drapkin, said he planned to run an alternate slate of directors. âYour highly questionable actions, however, have virtually eliminated time for any such discussions and have left us with no choice but to nominate an alternative slate of directors for the annual meeting who we know would willingly engage in open and constructive dialogue with shareholders,â he said in the letter. Casablanca Capital owns 5.5 percent of Mentor Graphics. Advertisement
