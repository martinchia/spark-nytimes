After staking $1 billion on the collapse of the nutritional supplement company Herbalife, William A. Ackmanâs activist hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, has been lobbying aggressively to bring it down, Michael S. Schmidt, Eric Lipton and Alexandra Stevenson write in The New York Times. Others have criticized the business practices of Herbalife, which sells vitamins and other supplements through independent distributors, but Mr. Ackmanâs attack is âunprecedented in its scale,â they write. For its part, Herbalife continues to strongly deny his accusations that the company is a pyramid scheme. An investigation by The New York Times found that Mr. Ackmanâs team had helped organize protests, news conferences and letter-writing campaigns across the United States to pressure state and federal regulators to investigate Herbalife, although several people who signed the letters say they do not remember sending them. His team has also paid civil rights organizations at least $130,000 to collect names of the people who claimed they were victimized by Herbalife. In response, Herbalife has mobilized its own army of lobbyists to defend the company against Mr. Ackmanâs charges. Mr. Ackman has persuaded a number of elected officials, including a New York State senator, to join his cause, arguing that he is trying to protect Hispanics, who he says are most frequently the victims of Herbalifeâs scheme. Mr. Schmidt, Mr. Lipton and Ms. Stevenson write: âMr. Ackmanâs efforts illustrate how Washington is increasingly becoming a battleground of Wall Streetâs financial titans, whose interest in influencing public policy is driven primarily by a desire for profit â part of an expanding practice in the nationâs capital, with corporations, law firms and lobbying practices establishing political intelligence units to gather news they can trade on.â  MORE TROUBLE FOR CREDIT SUISSE Â |Â  New documents made public on Friday point to mortgage lapses at Credit Suisse as the housing bubble inflated before the financial crisis, Gretchen Morgenson writes in The New York Times. The documents suggest that top officials at the bank routinely put pressure on subordinates to override due diligence standards and accept questionable loans that were then bundled into mortgage investments. “The documents are noteworthy because Credit Suisse, unlike many other major banks, has refused to settle large lawsuits stemming from the mortgage crisis. The bank has long maintained that its operations were held to a high standard and that the mortgage investments it sold lost value largely because of the broad housing collapse, rather than its practices,â Ms. Morgenson writes, adding, âThe previously confidential documents raise questions about the bankâs decision to fight, rather than settle, cases filed by plaintiffs including the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the New York attorney general.â The release of the documents, which include emails and other internal communications, is the latest in a string of difficulties for the Swiss bank. In February, United States senators questioned the bank over its role in helping American citizens hide money overseas and avoid taxes. And last year, a former mortgage trader was found guilty of hiding more than $100 million in mortgage bond losses at the bank by inflating the bondsâ value as the housing market collapsed.  JOBS DATA SHOWS SIGNS OF A THAW Â |Â  Things may be looking up in the jobs market. Fridayâs jobs report showed that the American economy created more jobs in February than in either of the previous two months, suggesting that the labor market might be waking up from a winter slowdown, Nelson D. Schwartz writes in The New York Times. And while analysts warned that the report was not a cause for celebration quite yet, it did ease fears of another prolonged slowdown. Employers hired 175,000 workers in February, still well short of the pace needed to return the economy to full employment. And while the unemployment rate rose slightly, to 6.7 percent, some economists were nevertheless encouraged because they viewed the uptick as a sign that more Americans were seeing signs of improving job opportunities and returning to the labor force.

A BLOW TO LENDERS IN ROYAL BANK OF CANADA RULING Â |Â  A Delaware judge ruled earlier this month against the Royal Bank of Canada over the lenderâs advice in the 2011 buyout of Rural/Metro Corporation, an ambulance operator, a decision that might have broad consequences for Wall Streetâs deal makers, Reuters writes. The judge said R.B.C. Capital Markets was negligent in its duty to shareholders when it failed to disclose conflicts of interest in the $438 million deal. R.B.C. bankers had pushed for a quick sale to the private equity firm Warburg Pincus at the same time as they were trying to provide financing to the firm to fund the buyout and other transactions. The decision is a blow to banks, which are increasingly facing lawsuits for their roles in mergers.   BANKERS SWAP FEES FOR DEAL CREDIT Â |Â  Bloomberg News reports that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs gave up millions of dollars in fees last month to get credit on a big deal they did not work on. Instead, the investment banks asked for credit in league tables, which are rankings of advisers on mergers and acquisitions maintained by Bloomberg and Dealogic, for working on the $25 billion sale last month of Forest Laboratories to Actavis. âThe trade highlights the importance of league tables to investment banks â which use them to pitch for new business â and the lengths to which banks will go to climb the rankings,â Bloomberg News writes. The banksâ previous contracts with Forest had a clause that entitled them to fees even if the company was sold by another bank.
