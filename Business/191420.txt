In fact, the net percentage of companies that say they have already increased their employment in the last three months â that is, the percent saying they increased their staff minus the percent saying they decreased it â was positive for the first time in nearly four years. You can read the whole post here. You're the Boss offers an insider's perspective on small-business ownership.
