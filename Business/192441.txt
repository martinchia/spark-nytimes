Maybe Bill Gates should follow Steven Ballmer out of Microsoft.  Allowing Microsoft to buy Nokiaâs smartphone business as he exits will saddle Mr. Ballmer’s successor  with a flawed strategy. Mr. Gates, the companyâs founder and chairman, bears some responsibility for this and other missteps. With less than 5 percent of the shares â scarcely more than Mr. Ballmer owns â Mr. Gates matters more to his charitable foundation than to Microsoft these days. In a sense, itâs sacrilegious to suggest that Mr. Gates and the software behemoth he started part ways. He understands technology like few others and has demonstrated the acumen to create a huge business, now worth some $270 billion. With about $12.4 billion of stock, he is also still the biggest single shareholder and, given the long personal association, he surely cares about Microsoftâs future. Yet his many talents donât include effectiveness as chairman. Under his leadership, Microsoftâs board left Mr. Ballmer in place too long. Now that Mr. Ballmer is to retire as chief executive within a year, Mr. Gates doesnât have a replacement ready, an important task for any chairman.  The board let Mr. Ballmer waste money by chasing consumer markets and hardware, with the companyâs online services business losing $12 billion over the last three years alone. Directors also just sanctioned the purchase of Nokiaâs smartphone operations for $7.2 billion, locking Mr. Ballmerâs successor into manufacturing devices â hardly a Microsoft strength these days. True, in the last decade of Mr. Ballmerâs 13-year tenure the maturing company has returned more than $180 billion to investors, far more than any of its technology peers. Profit has also risen sharply. Despite this and Mr. Ballmerâs passion, evident at Microsoftâs annual investor meeting last week, shareholders just donât seem to believe in the companyâs strategy, developed with Mr. Ballmer and Mr. Gates in charge.  Over 10 years, Microsoft shares are barely higher. By comparison, with the odd exception like Hewlett-Packard, the likes of Apple, Google, Oracle and IBM have recorded big gains. The Nasdaq index has roughly doubled. Mr. Gatesâs primary interest also arguably lies elsewhere these days. He stopped working full time at Microsoft five years ago. The $38 billion endowment of his charitable foundation dwarfs his Microsoft holding. Improving education and preventing disease worldwide may also seem more compelling these days than deciding whether a sprawling company should build tablet computers. Mr. Ballmerâs belated departure offers Mr. Gates a window of opportunity. The world might be better off with his full attention on the foundation â and so would Microsoftâs investors.
