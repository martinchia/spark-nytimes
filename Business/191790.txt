When it comes to merger advising, Goldman Sachs is like a venerable sports franchise that has stumbled early in the season.  Thomson Reuters’ preliminary M.&A. advising league table for the first quarter shows Goldman in 10th place for deals in the United States. Last year, Goldman took the crown for both the United States and the world. Morgan Stanley, Goldman’s traditional rival, is at the top for the first quarter. But possibly more galling to Goldman is that much smaller advisory firms — Evercore Partners (No 3.), Lazard (No. 8)  and Rothschild  (No. 9) — are also above it in the league table. The biggest United States deal so far this year that Goldman gets credit for is the proposed $10 billion NYSE Euronext-Deutsche BÃ¶rse merger — and in that instance Goldman was not even the primary adviser but among the financial firms that provided “further financial advice.”  Megan Davies of Reuters notes that “while deal rankings can move around dramatically each quarter, it is still embarrassing for Wall Street’s premier bank to have fallen in the pecking order.” Indeed the reaction is something akin to what would be heard if the New York Yankees were six games under .500 come late May. Early in the season, yes, but still.  The main reasons for Goldman’s underperformance are clear. As DealBook previously reported, Goldman was absent from AT&T’s $39 billion deal for T-Mobile, having advised another wireless company, Sprint Nextel.  The other big deal that bolstered the ranking of many Wall Street firms this year, Reuters says, was the huge restructuring of American International Group. Goldman was absent from that as well, not surprisingly given their relationship during the financial crisis. (Although the firm was selected to be among the lead underwriters in the first sale of the government’s share holdings in A.I.G.) Interestingly, the Thomson Reuters data also show Goldman No. 1 in the only ranking that really matters in the end: deal fees.   Goldman, with a leading 7.2 percent share of the United States M.&A. market, is looking to pull in some $257 million in deal fees, estimates Freeman & Company for Thomson Reuters, slightly more than the amount calculated for Morgan Stanley, at No. 2.
