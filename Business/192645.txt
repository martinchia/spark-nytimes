 The Blackstone Group has devised a novel definition of “skin in the game” — Â other peopleâs money.  To improve its returns, the buyout and debt management firm is taking advantage of newly relaxed rules on how much risk needs to be retained in securitizations. Its structure looks acceptable, but regulators and investors should still watch for sharp practice from future copycats. European skin-in-the-game rules were introduced to prevent a repetition of the 2008 mortgage crisis, which saw lenders make dud loans and flip them to bond markets. Creators of assets that are securitized now have to keep 5 percent of the risk. That hampered the issuance in Europe of collateralized loan obligations, a kind of investment vehicle funded through securitized debt. Few of the asset managers who oversee the vehicles can finance one euro for every 20 they manage. The European Banking Authority tweaked the rules last December so that asset managers could avoid retaining the risk in the C.L.O. â so long as another entity does, and that entity originates half the C.L.O.âs loans. Blackstone is among the first to notice. It has set up an originator to make loans and repackage them as C.L.O.s â managed by Blackstone, naturally. The twist is that the skin in the game will mostly come from public equity markets. It looks like a robust model: the company is a long-term lender; investors benefit from an independent and experienced board, and the shareholders themselves donât look like yield-hungry hotheads. One of them is the Church of England. Moreover, it is debatable how appropriate the skin-in-the-game guidelines are for C.L.O.s anyway, where managers are incentivized through long-dated fees and do not get paid upfront for making bad loans. The bigger question is whether the purpose-built origination vehicles that look set to spring up will all meet the spirit as well as the letter of the retention rules. The danger is a return to pre-2008 structures where investors do not properly understand the risks, or where the funds no longer qualify for risk retention. If the regulators get an inkling this is happening, they may tighten the rules again. Neil Unmack is a columnist at Reuters Breakingviews.
