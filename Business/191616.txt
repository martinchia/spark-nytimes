J.P. Morgan Chase has agreed to pay $110 million to settle a class-action suit challenging the way it charged debit card fees to customers who spent more than what was in their accounts. âWe are pleased to have reached an agreement in principle,â said a Chase spokesman, Patrick Linehan. The tentative settlement, which must receive court approval, was reported Friday by the American Banker. Bank of America agreed last year to pay $410 million to settle the suit, filed against more than a dozen banks in Federal  District Court for the Southern District of Florida. At issue in the suit is the manner in which banks traditionally processed customer transactions. By processing payments in the order from largest to smallest, banks can maximize the amount of overdraft fees charged, if a customer spends more than is available in the account. The practice resulted in outcry over the so-called â$38 dollar cup of coffee,â in which a customer overdraws his or her account by buying a $3 beverage with a debit card and is hit with a $35 overdraft fee. Chase, like other banks, has moved away from that processing practice and now pays debit transactions in the order in which they occur. In addition, federal rules now require banks to get customersâ permission to receive overdraft protection, which allows them to overspend, but pay a fee. Even with the changes, a recent study found that overdraft fees are still quite high. Have you ever paid a hefty overdraft fee for a relatively small purchase?
