	Attention recent college graduates — as well as parents who covered those big tuition bills. You may not want to hear this, but a study released on Wednesday found that entry-level wages for students who graduated from college in 2010 was lower than a decade earlier, after adjusting for inflation.   	The study was done by Heidi Shierholz, a labor market economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research and policy center. She found that after gains in the 1980s and 1990s, entry-level hourly wages for college-educated men (without advanced degrees) were $21.77 in 2010, down 4.5 percent from $22.75 in 2000. For college-educated women, entry-level wages were $18.43 in 2010, the study found, down 5.2 percent from $19.38 10 years earlier. (The figures are in 2010 dollars.) 	Ms. Shierholz said in an interview, âWeâre seeing increased demand for college grads, but the fact that we see these declining wages suggests that demand is being more than met by the increased supply of college grads.â  	She said that in the decade after 2000, the business cycle was tough on workers and wages across the board, except for those at the very top.  âThese young people coming out of college get swooped up in the bottom part of the wage distribution that really suffered during the whole decade after 2000,â she said. Her study concluded on a pessimistic note: âWith unemployment expected to remain above 8 percent well into 2014, it will likely be many years before young college graduates â or any workers â see substantial wage growth.â Floyd Norris, the chief financial correspondent of The New York Times, covers the world of finance and  economics.
