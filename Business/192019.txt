The hedge fund manager John A. Paulson has donated more than Â£2.5 million to the London School of Economics and Political Science to foster research on Europe in the post-crisis financial world. There is certainly a lot to study. Europe’s sovereign debt crisis remains a concern for investors worldwide, and the future remains challenging for the euro, the single currency in the world’s largest trading bloc.  The donation will establish a position dedicated to scholarship in finance, policy and the European Union. “I am honored to partner with the London School of Economics to support critical research needed to ensure a stable and enduring European financial system,” Mr. Paulson said in a statement. His firm, Paulson & Company, manages about $36 billion in assets, making it among the largest hedge fund firms in the world. The firm netted about $5 billion in paper gains in 2010, thanks in large part to a concentrated bet on the value of gold. So far this year, Paulson funds have caught the downside of gold price movements, at least for the month of January, as prices fell. Advertisement
