Berkshire Hathaway, the holding company led by Warren E. Buffett, has agreed to buy the remaining shares of Wesco Financial Corporation, one of its largest subsidiaries, for $547.6 million in stock and cash, the companies announced Monday. The ties between the companies run deep. The relationship started in the early 1970s when Berkshire indirectly invested roughly $30 million in Wesco; Berkshire has owned an 80.1 percent share since 1983. Wesco, which is based Pasadena, Calif., is run by Charles T. Munger, Berkshireâs vice chairman and Mr. Buffettâs longtime business partner. In many ways, Wesco is a small version of Berkshire. While it focuses mainly on insurance, Wesco operates other businesses, including a furniture rental company and a steel service center. Mr. Munger, like Mr. Buffett, is known for his folksy investment wisdom, which he doles out at the annual meetings of Berkshire and Wesco and has collected in a book, âPoor Charlieâs Almanack.â âThis book is something of a publishing miracle â never advertised, yet year after year selling many thousands of copies from its Internet site,â Mr. Buffett wrote of Mr. Mungerâs book in his letter to Berkshire shareholders last year. The deal would mean an end to Wescoâs highly anticipated yearly meeting. But Mr. Munger, 87, promises to hold an âAfternoon With Charlieâ if the deal is consummated by early June, according to the deal announcement. The event would give investors in both companies a chance to ask him âabout business, economics and life,â albeit not about Wesco, the announcement said. The deal has been expected for months. Berkshire announced its plans to buy the remaining 19.9 percent of Wescoâs common stock in September. At the time, Wescoâs board formed a committee of independent directors, which concluded that the purchase was fair and in the best interests of shareholders. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter. Advertisement
