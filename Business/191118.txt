LONDON â The San Francisco health care services firm McKesson Corporation said on Thursday that it had agreed to acquire a controlling stake in Celesio of Germany and will start a tender offer for its remaining shares in a deal valued at $8.3 billion. The deal would create one of the worldâs largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and providers of logistics and services in the health care sector, with annual revenue of more than $150 billion and about 81,500 employees worldwide. The combined company would operate in 20 countries.  âThe health care industry is evolving rapidly, marked by convergence between segments and increased globalization,â said John H. Hammergren, McKessonâs chairman and chief executive. âWith today’s announcement, we will bring together the strengths and expertise of each company to address global health care challenges.â After completing the transaction, McKesson and Celesio will maintain their own brands and continue to support customers through existing channels. Celesioâs operations will be incorporated into McKesson’s distribution solutions unit. Both companies act as distributors providing generic, branded and over-the-counter drugs to pharmacy chains, independent pharmacists and institutions, such as hospitals. Celesio also operates Lloyds, a British pharmacy chain. The deal would likely help both companies in terms of their purchasing power, but, despite the size of the combined firm, likely wouldn’t result in much change in drug prices for consumers. Pharmaceutical pricing is heavily regulated in many of the countries where the combined entity would operate, so there is little wiggle room to alter pricing. However, some of their customers may be able to achieve wholesale cost savings at pharmacies on over-the-counter products, which may or may not be passed on to the consumer. The deal is subject to regulatory approval by German financial authorities, as well as competition regulators in three countries: Austria, Ireland and Slovenia. However, their footprints have little overlap and are expected to complement each other, so regulatory approval isnât expected to be an issue. McKesson is primarily in North America, while Celesio has strong footholds in Europe and Brazil. As part of the deal, McKesson would acquire a 50.01 percent stake in Celesio from Franz Haniel & Cie., the firmâs majority shareholder. The share purchase has been approved by McKessonâs board and Franz Haniel & Cie.âs supervisory board. It then intends to begin a tender offer to acquire Celesioâs remaining outstanding shares for 23 euros, or $31.76, a share, 39 percent above the three-month average weighted price before Oct. 8, when market speculation began that Celesio might be acquired. The company also plans to start a simultaneous tender offer for Celesioâs outstanding convertible bonds. The offers are expected during McKessonâs fiscal third quarter, which ends Dec. 31. âThis transaction is about growth,â said Marion Helmes, Celesioâs chief financial officer, “it positions our operations for success and brings benefits for all Celesio stakeholders. This combination allows two market leaders with complementary geographic footprints to work together in an increasingly global market segment.â McKesson expects to assume operational control of Celesio during its fiscal year 2015, which begins in April. The transaction will be financed by cash and a bridge financing loan, McKesson said.  Analysts were generally positive on the deal, saying it could lead to increased efficiencies and cost savings. McKesson is the largest of three wholesale distributors that account for 85 percent of the American drug market, according to Modern Distribution Management, a trade publication focused on the wholesale industry. Its main competitors in the United States are Cardinal Health and Amerisource Bergen. Celesio, one of Europeâs largest wholesalers, primarily competes in Europe with Alliance Boots and Phoenix Pharmahandel.
