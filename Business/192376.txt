 WASHINGTON —  Sales of existing homes rebounded slightly in April, but the pace of buying remained slower than last year’s. The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.65 million, up 1.3 percent from March. Home purchases dropped 6.8 percent in the last 12 months. Much of the April gains were concentrated in the volatile condominium market, which grew by 7.3 percent. Sales of single-family homes rose just 0.5 percent last month. Home sales continue to be significantly slower than the 2013 pace, when 5.1 million used homes were sold. That is well below sales of 5.5 million that are consistent with a healthy housing market.

Would-be buyers also wrestled with higher prices and rising interest rates in the last 12 months, causing the real estate market to lose some momentum from last year.

The market has a 5.9-month supply of homes, up from 5.2 months a year ago.

Prices continued to increase, yet the limited demand appears to have eased the pace of growth. Median prices rose 5.2 percent to $201,700 in April, the slowest growth rate since March 2012, the Realtors group said.

In another measure of economic health, the number of people seeking unemployment benefits jumped last week, but remained at a low level that suggests hiring will remain steady.

Initial jobless claims rose 28,000 to a seasonally adjusted 326,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The increase occurred two weeks after jobless claims fell to their lowest level since May 2007. The four-week average of jobless claims, a less volatile measure, dipped 1,000, to 322,500. The average reached a seven-year low of 312,000 last month. Jobless claims are a proxy for layoffs, so the low levels suggest companies are cutting fewer jobs. The Conference Board’s index of leading indicators, which is intended to predict overall economic activity, posted a solid gain last month, providing further evidence of stronger growth after the severe winter hindered activity. On Thursday, the board reported that the index increased 0.4 percent in April, after an upwardly revised 1 percent gain in March.
