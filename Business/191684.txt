Coupang, a fast-growing e-commerce company in South Korea, has raised $300 million of additional financing to aid its expansion plans. The latest financing round, coming after a $100 million round this spring, was led by BlackRock Private Equity Partners and includes participation from the Wellington Management Company, Coupang said on Wednesday. The backing from those institutional investors â BlackRock is the worldâs largest asset manager â underscores Coupangâs maturity and its ambitions to one day be a publicly traded company. For now, however, Coupang is content staying private. While Bom Kim, the chief executive, declined to disclose the companyâs valuation, he said it was higher than the roughly $1 billion price tag the company achieved in its previous financing round. He also said the company now had about $500 million of cash in the bank. âStaying private, but being able to take on strategic investments from companies like BlackRock, is the best of both worlds,â Mr. Kim said. âThese are public market investors who do invest for the long term.” Coupang, based in Seoul, calls itself the Amazon of Korea. In addition to selling its own inventory, the company allows third-party merchants to sell through its site. While it competes in Korea with eBay and a site called 11th Street, Coupang says its competitive edge stems from its focus on ordering through mobile devices and from its delivery network. Like Amazon, Coupang has built its own warehouses, called fulfillment centers. But it has gone a step beyond Amazon by also employing its own delivery workers, whom it calls âCoupang men.â (Mr. Kim said the fleet includes some women as well.) These workers, who try to build relationships with customers by doing things like leaving handwritten notes, can often deliver packages on the day they are ordered. Mr. Kim, 36, who started Coupang in late 2010 after dropping out of Harvard Business School, said the company was now generating gross sales â the total value of goods passing through the site â of $2.2 billion on an annualized basis. He said roughly one in three people in South Korea had downloaded the company’s app. A version of this article appears in print on 12/11/2014, on page B10 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Successful Fund-Raising.
