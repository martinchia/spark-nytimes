The J. Crew Group and its two new private equity owners agreed on Thursday to pay $16 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit over the retailer’s $3 billion leveraged buyout, according to a filing in Delaware’s Court of Chancery. The payout is higher than the $10 million offered in an earlier settlement with the investors, which include several municipal pension funds. That pact fell apart in February, weeks before the company’s other shareholders voted to approve J. Crew’s sale to TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners. Despite the failure of that earlier settlement, J. Crew and its buyers agreed to honor some of the terms of that agreement, including extending a “go-shop” period that allowed the retailer to seek alternative bids and preventing its chief executive, Millard S. Drexler, from voting his holdings in favor of the TPG deal. TPG and Leonard Green had also agreed to lower the deal’s breakup fee and to waive their matching rights if a higher bid emerged.  But lawyers for the shareholders were irate that J. Crew had already scheduled a March 1 shareholder meeting to vote on the TPG deal, arguing that the move could stifle the hunt for other bidders. Those investors sought to walk away from the settlement. After the deal closed on March 7, J. Crew and the shareholders continued wrangling in court, with the retailer seeking to enforce the terms of the original settlement. Months of negotiations later, the two sides agreed that J. Crew and the buyout firms would pay an additional $6 million.
