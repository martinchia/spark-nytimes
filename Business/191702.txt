The proposed merger of OneWest Bank and the CIT Group faces a new and somewhat rare regulatory hurdle. Federal banking regulators have scheduled a public hearing for later this month to collect information as part of their review of OneWestâs performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said on Friday. The regulators are also gathering information about the âneeds of the communitiesâ that will be affected by the merged bank. For months, the California Reinvestment Coalition, a nonprofit group, has been calling for a public hearing about the merger after raising concerns about OneWestâs foreclosures practices. “Weâre hopeful this hearing wonât be a dog and pony show followed by a rubber-stamp approval of the merger,” Kevin Stein, associate director of the coalition, said in a statement. Formerly known as IndyMac bank, an aggressive subprime mortgage lender, OneWest was acquired by a group of private equity and hedge fund investors after it collapsed in 2008. As part of that acquisition, the Federal Insurance Deposit Corporation agreed to share many of the bankâs losses that were largely driven by IndyMacâs risky mortgage lending. In July, CIT said it would acquire OneWest, paying $3.4 billion in cash and stock. A commercial lender that was felled by its own problems during the financial crisis and rehabilitated under the helm of the longtime Wall Street executive John Thain, CIT covets OneWestâs large base of deposits. The last hearing that the Fed held about a bank merger involved ING and Capitol One in 2011.   The hearing on the OneWest-CIT merger is scheduled for Feb. 26 at the Fed’s offices in Los Angeles. Representatives for the banks could not be immediately reached. Advertisement
