Updated, 3:26 p.m. |  Two of Allergan’s largest shareholders have broken their silence to insist that the company not strike any deals before a scheduled special meeting in December.  The unusual statements came on Friday from T-Rowe Price, Allergan’s third-largest shareholder with 5.4 percent of the stock, and Pentwater Capital Management, its 12th-largest shareholder, with about 1.3 percent of the stock.  Both investors called on Allergan to refrain from agreeing to acquire another company before the meeting, scheduled for Dec. 18., at which shareholders will have a chance to vote out a majority of the board.  The statements were in response to reports that Allergan was in talks with Salix Pharmaceuticals about an all-cash deal that would likely scuttle the pending $53 billion offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals and William A. Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management.  Allergan, the maker of Botox, has also been approached by Actavis, a bigger Irish drug company, which is interested in buying the company.  Some shareholders, however, are uncomfortable with the idea that Allergan could block the Valeant and Pershing Square bid with an all-cash deal.  “Over the past several months, we have been watching with growing concern the corporate governance practices of the Allergan board,” Bill Benintende, a T. Rowe Price spokesman, said in a statement, speaking for all of the institutional investor’s funds.  T. Rowe went on to say that the Allergan board had a “special duty” to “refrain from approving any significant, irreversible commitments by the company between now and then unless shareholders are offered the opportunity to vote on them.”   Apparently referring to the talks with Salix, T. Rowe said, “this should apply even in the event of all-cash acquisitions that do not ordinarily require a shareholder vote.” T. Rowe has substantially increased its stake in Allergan in recent months. Its stake of 5.3 percent, worth more than $2.8 billion, was up sharply from the 2.5 percent of shares it owned at the end of March.  Earlier on Friday, Pentwater became the first Allergan shareholder to call on the company to refrain from striking any deals before the special meeting.  âWe have watched for the past several months as Allerganâs board has continued to refuse to meet with Valeant to explore its premium bid for Allergan,â Matthew C. Halbower, Pentwaterâs chief executive, wrote in a letter to the Allergan board.  Mr. Halbower said that between the refusal to engage with Valeant, and the interest from Actavis, shareholders should get a chance to vote on the company’s leadership before any significant deals were struck.  âDespite receiving two premium bids, Allerganâs board has refused to engage with either bidder,” Mr. Halbower said. “This type of shareholder destructive action has led over 35 percent of Allerganâs shareholders to request a special meeting to remove Allerganâs current directors.â Mr. Halbower went on to say that Allerganâs board had become âincreasingly hostile toward its own shareholders,â and expressed dismay at reports that Allergan was in talks with Salix. âPentwater does not understand how Allerganâs directors could possibly conclude it is an appropriate exercise of their fiduciary duty to embark on such a large-scale acquisition without first engaging with Valeant and Actavis,â Mr. Halbower said. âThis is especially the case given that, in less than three months, Allergan shareholders will vote on whether to remove six of Allerganâs directors.â In closing, Mr. Halbower stressed that âPentwater is strongly opposed to the board of Allergan agreeing to any significant acquisition that does not allow shareholders to vote on the transaction.â The statements from T. Rowe and Pentwater were the most explicit thus far from Allergan shareholders, who have watched from the sidelines for months as the company waged a war of words with Valeant and Mr. Ackman.  Allergan did not respond to requests for comment.  Advertisement
