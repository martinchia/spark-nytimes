The struggles of a business trying to survive. I have two risky projects underway at the moment. The first is to replace our website because it has an unworkable administrative portal and doesnât display well on mobile devices. The second is related to how we price our conference tables. We are custom builders, and we offer a wide variety of sizes, shapes, materials and features. My sales guys, Don Wuest and Nate Rossman, work with each client to come up with something that is appropriate for their situation, and in the course of arriving at the final design, we generally end up presenting a number of options. Each option needs to have its own price, which we generate with an Excel spreadsheet that we have been using for seven years. The spreadsheet was brought to us by a salesman we hired in 2007. Before then, we had no good way to generate prices â we really did pull numbers out of the air and hope for the best. As we got deeper into selling tables over the Internet, it became apparent that this was not a viable strategy. Enter our sales hire, who offered to teach us how to price custom work.  He brought a spreadsheet that had been designed to price millwork â doors, paneling, stuff like that â for the New York market. He and my then-partnerâs daughter, Sasha, who is an information technology genius, worked for six months to adapt the spreadsheet to our requirements. And they did a good job, all things considered. We moved from a non-system to something that kicked out numbers that had a reasonable relationship to the proposed design. It accounted for changes in size, changes in material and a bunch of other options our clients consider. And it made it easy to create a series of quotes showing how the price would change with various design options. The spreadsheet uses algorithms to estimate the number of hours that will be required to draw, build, finish and pack a table. It also makes a rough estimate of the amount of materials in the table and uses prices for those materials to come up with an amount that we should charge. Over the years, we have priced hundreds of jobs with this system. But while it’s easy to use, it does have a number of flaws: 1) None of the material prices have been updated since 2007. There are hundreds of items, and the task of contacting vendors for current pricing is too much for me. And I have nobody else to do it. I have spot-checked a few prices lately, and they have been lower than they were when first recorded â the recession was good for something, I guess. 2) The logic behind theÂ algorithms that generate the estimated hours is driven mostly by the size of the table, not its complexity. As we expand the types of tables we make, this becomes increasingly problematic. 3) Our products and production methods have changed drastically since the spreadsheet was created. The algorithms are based on a product that no longer exists. 4) As our product evolves, the mismatch between what the spreadsheet thinks we are doing and what we are actually doing forces the salesmen to make a bunch of judgment calls when quoting a price. That means we are heading back to where we started: no real system for pricing. You might think it would be easy to go back and check how we actually performed against the spreadsheet estimates and then make appropriate modifications. And, of course, I have tried to do this. Our custom FileMaker database, also written by Sasha, tracks the materials we bought for each job and the hours everyone put into it. Unfortunately, a close look at all of that data leaves me baffled. The materials records show only what was purchased for the job â not how much was actually used or how much was left over from another job. Also, there is no connection between FileMaker and QuickBooks, so I canât easily crosscheck the records against the bills we paid, which means there is no way to tell whether the records are accurate. And the records for labor hours are suspect, too. Sometimes we use fewer hours than we estimated (good for us) and sometimes we use more (bad for us). This can happen because the salespeople make a poor estimate, because the algorithms in the spreadsheet are off for the product we made, because the workers experience unusual conditions (broken machines, illness), because we experiment with a different way to build a table â or because the workers simply enter the wrong data. It’s easy for them to be confused when one contract calls for several pieces to be built. I have often read advice from people on how to price goods and services, and the advice always assumes that operations can be performed in such a way that statistically relevant conclusions can be drawn â that every product is the result of repeatable, measurable steps that can be matched to a cost with a high degree of precision. In a small company like mine, I have found the opposite to be true. We have a record-keeping system that was cobbled together, we have data of uncertain quality, and we have a complex and constantly evolving manufacturing environment that never allows us to repeat anything often enough to draw conclusions. Itâs a mess. And I cannot afford to shut down operations and run experiments to get better data. I donât have the resources. For the last three years, I have been attempting to get around this problem by checking to see how, in aggregate, our performance matches our estimates. I have a spreadsheet devoted to this, and I update it every Monday. It looks at the sum of the hours that our estimates generated for all of the jobs we have worked since the start of the year, and it compares that figure to the total hours the workers have entered into the database. In other words, it is a reflection of both the quality of the pricing model and our performance on the shop floor. Hereâs a chart that shows our results: The chart shows these sums expressed as a percentage: the difference between the estimate and the actual hours divided by the sum of the estimated hours. The horizontal axis contains 52 weeks. As you can see, our performance was steady in 2012 â we used about 5.5 percent fewer labor hours than we got paid for over the course of the year. In 2013, we started poorly, because we had made some new hires, and the time spent training them pushed us behind our estimates. But our performance got better as those workers became more efficient. We ended up right where we were in 2012 â about 5.5 percent under estimate. I was struck by how closely our results in the last half of 2013 matched those in 2012. Now look at 2014. We started the year by introducing an innovation that eliminated a number of manufacturing steps, and we also changed the location of two machines to free up a space that was getting jammed with work in progress. And we assigned one of the manufacturing steps that we need to perform on every job to a single worker, so that he was doing just that one, difficult task all day. We did not, as far as I know, change the pricing model â although Don and Nate may have tossed some extra hours into their estimates without telling me. As you can see, something caused a big change in our trends. Suddenly, we were building jobs much, much faster than estimated. At the end of January, I came to the conclusion that our pricing spreadsheet was so broken that I had better get started on a replacement. This has proved to be a daunting task. I have been spending one to three hours on it every day, and I have not finished. My first problem was to understand how the spreadsheet works. I am not an Excel expert, and Sasha isnât around anymore. It took me weeks to pick apart the code, cell by cell. And then I had to consider whether the assumptions that it was making were reasonable â and whether I could come up with a better alternative. Ultimately, the real question is: Should I be doing this? After all, the current sheet is throwing out prices that cover our costs and then some â they are generating a healthy profit. On the other hand, I worry about operating with a model that is drifting further from reality. Because the estimates predict that it will take us much longer to complete a job than it really does, we can no longer use those estimates to assess our backlog and our availability to take on new jobs. And our high prices make it difficult for us to do business in situations where we sell to a middleman. I would like to expand my market by working with more furniture dealers, but this is keeping me from figuring out whether we can afford to offer wholesale prices. I am confident that my revision of the spreadsheet will generate better labor and material estimates. But I wonât be able to test it without using it, and that means running the risk that the initial set of calculations that I write could be wrong. It will take months to roll the new prices all of the way through our system. If it turns out that my formulas underestimate the time we need, we would no longer be collecting enough money to cover our costs, and we could get into serious trouble. Right now, I am sitting on a cash reserve of more than $250,000. It could be used to help see us through the initial rollout of a new pricing model. But I donât have to do this. I can just continue to use the old model â at least until we get the new website up and running. Which will bring its own risks. What would you do if you were me? Would you roll the dice?
