I am just back from presenting a paper at the European Law and Economics Association annual meeting, held this year in Hamburg, Germany.  And of course the topic on everyoneâs lips at every coffee break, lunch and paper session was the Greece-French-Bank-Generalized-Euro-Zone Panic of 2011. There was general agreement among the conference participants about what needed to be done: Creditors must take a haircut; Greece must accept some austerity; Greece must also be bailed out, because it was unreasonable to expect the Greeks to accept too much more austerity; and some banks will also have to be bailed out.  The latter might involve some partial nationalization ( or E.U.-ization?) of the subject banks, along the lines of the United States government stakes in General Motors, American International Group, etc. There was also general agreement that the politicians would never do any of these things â save, perhaps for the more austerity thing â because they are scared.  Only when they realized that the public was not fooled, and understood what needed to be done, would the politicians act.  We can hope that this last step does not take too long.  A depressing state of affairs, but at least the Europeans seem to agree on what the situation calls for.  The United States has not yet reached even that degree of consensus.  Of course, perhaps we have more time to dally than the Europeans do. The notion that Greece, and maybe some other sovereign debtors, may need to impose haircuts on their creditors will inevitably bring to the surface the old debate about whether some sort of bankruptcy mechanism for nations.   The casual reader will be surprised to learn there is no such mechanism, given the media’s penchant for referring to a looming Greek âbankruptcy,â or even the need for Greece to âdeclareâ bankruptcy. (It’s worth noting that bankruptcy does not mean insolvency, at least in modern usage.  Indeed, outside of the United States,  bankruptcy usually refers only to personal bankruptcy.) Although Iâve had my dalliances with the idea of a bankruptcy process for sovereign entities, it does need to be asked if worrying about a bankruptcy process is not simply a waste of time.  Much of what can be achieved through a bankruptcy process can also be achieved in the sovereign context by a bailout that comes with conditions attached.  And much of the rest â like the âautomatic stayâ â is simply irrelevant, because of the distinct nature of sovereign entities. And while the European Union might like the idea of tying itself to the mast, and thus pre-announcing a policy for a future debt crisis, in the sovereign context each case is new. That is, the rule the sovereign announced last time for this kind of situation can always be changed if the sovereign thinks it’s the right thing to do this time around.   So, while it is possible to  spend a lot time talking about a sovereign bankruptcy system, Iâm not sure itâs worth the effort.  As an academic, it is a conversation Iâd love to have, but I suspect that real-world actors have better things to do with their time. Advertisement
