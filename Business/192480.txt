The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science will be awarded early Monday morning New York time (1 p.m. Swedish time, at the earliest). Every year predictions are made, and the actual winners are not always among the betting pool favorites. (And besides, there are also fewer prominent betting pools available this year.) Still, some of the names I’m hearing floated as contenders this year include Jean Tirole, Bengt Holmstrom, Oliver Hart, Robert Barro, Paul Romer, Avinash Dixit, Angus Deaton, Lars Peter Hansen, William Baumol, Robert Shiller, Richard Thaler, Andrei Shleifer, William Nordhaus, Douglas Diamond, Alan Krueger, David Card, Joshua Angrist, Jerry Hausman and Eugene Fama. Here’s one analysis from Thomson Reuters based on citation counts; another from Hubert Fromlet, visiting professor of international economics at Linnaeus University in Sweden, as reported by Bloomberg Businessweek; and another roundup from Brenda Cronin of The Wall Street Journal. Last year’s winners were Alvin E. Roth and Lloyd S. Shapley, cited for their work on “the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design.” Whom are you betting on this year?
