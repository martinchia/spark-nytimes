LONDON â The private equity firm CVC Capital Partners is in talks to buy some of the Campbell Soup Companyâs operations in Europe.  Under the terms of the deal, CVC would acquire a number of brands in France, Germany, Sweden and Belgium, as well as four factories in Europe, according to a company statement. Campbell Soup would retain its businesses in Britain and Denmark. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, though Campbell Soup said the combined revenue from the European businesses being sold was $530 million for the 12 months ended April 30. Campbell Soup said it expected the deal to be completed by the first quarter of 2014. The sale of some of its European operations comes after a number of acquisitions by Campbell Soup, as it looks for new markets. Last year, Campbell Soup bought Bolthouse Farms from the private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners for $1.55 billion in Campbell’s largest deal to date. Allen & Overy advised Campbell Soup on the deal, while Leopold Capital Partners, Barclays, Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton and Ernst & Young advised CVC Capital Partners. Advertisement
