Most of the Wall Street chatter surrounding initial public offerings revolves around the trendy Internet companies like Zynga and Groupon that recently listed their shares.  But those I.P.O.’s look downright unfashionable compared with Michael Kors Holdings, the fashion company named after its celebrity designer.  Michael Kors‘s shares rose as much as 26 percent on Tuesday after the company released its first earnings report as a publicly traded company.  It priced its I.P.O. two months ago at $20 a share; on Tuesday afternoon, the stock was trading as high as $42. The company has a market value of about $8 billion.  Despite the wobbly economy, luxury brands continue to perform well. Both Ralph Lauren and Coach have announced strong earnings in recent weeks. With a more than 100 percent gain — or a double, in Wall Street parlance — Michael Kors is second-most successful debut of last year’s 125 I.P.O.s, behind the technology company InvenSense. Both Zynga and Groupon are trading below their I.P.O. price. (LinkedIn, the professional-networking Web site, has been the most successful of the Internet I.P.O.’s, up about 95 percent since it began trading.)  “Michael Kors has strong and expanding global recognition as a brand that embodies the jet-set lifestyle that consumers aspire to,” John Idol, its chief executive, said on a conference call. “We believe that we are well positioned to continue to build our global luxury lifestyle brand, and that we have a tremendous opportunity for growth.”  The company’s rapid growth was reflected in Tuesday’s third-quarter earnings results. Revenue increased about 68 percent from a year earlier to $374 million. Its gross profit jumped about 75 percent to $220 million. The company also opened 28 new retail stores during the quarter; as of year-end 2011, it has 231 stores worldwide.  The designer Michael Kors, who grew up on Long Island, started his brand in 1981 as a high-end luxury collection, competing with couture brands like Chanel and Gucci. Beginning in 2004, the company started Michael, an “accessible luxury” segment that now fuels much of its growth and accounts for about 90 percent of its revenue. During meetings with investors to market the company’s I.P.O., Mr. Idol, the chief executive, referred to the brand as “HermÃ¨s for Staten Island.”  Mr. Kors, 52, is the public face of the company, with a regular appearances on the reality-TV show “Project Runway.” The I.P.O. has made him a very rich man. He sold about $120 million worth of stock in the I.P.O. and maintains a roughly 9 percent stake in the company that, at Wednesday’s share price, is worth about $700 million.  Michael Kors’s earnings results well exceeded the estimate of Wall Street analysts, who have been largely breathless in their praise of the company. All of the large banks starting coverage of Michael Kors late last month issued either “buy” or “overweight” ratings on the stock. “Get aboard this jet-set growth story,” a Jeffries analyst said. And J.P. Morgan said the company had a “long ‘runway’ for growth.”  On Tuesday, Nomura’s analyst called the quarter a “blowout” and stretched to find anything negative.  “Jewelry category was so strong that they ran out of product during holiday,” wrote Paul Lejuez, the Nomura analyst. “O.K., maybe that really isn’t a negative (we needed something).” The company’s valuation is rich. At $42 a share, Michael Kors has already surpassed the price targets of most Wall Street banks, which were generally in the low 30s. And the company now trades at a steep valuation of about 55 times its 2012 earnings estimate, more than double the average valuation of other global luxury brands. It is a busy couple of days for Mr. Kors. On Wednesday, he unveils his fall 2012 collection at New York Fashion Week. Advertisement
