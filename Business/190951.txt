LONDON â The private equity firm Vista Equity Partners agreed on Monday to buy the British software company Misys for Â£1.27 billion, or $2 billion.  The announcement comes after merger talks between Misys and a Swiss rival, Temenos, collapsed last week. Vista said it planned to combine the British company, which makes software to help financial institutions run their risk-management and other back-office operations, with Turaz, one of its existing companies that makes trade and risk-management software. The private equity firm said it was offering shareholders 350 pence for each of their Misys shares, 6.2 percent above the company’s closing share price on Friday. âThrough our deep experience with enterprise software companies, we believe that Misys has an attractive future that we plan to invest in and grow,â Vista Equity’s chief executive, Robert F. Smith, said in a statement. âWith the combination of Misys and Turaz, we are creating the global leader in core banking, treasury management, capital markets and enterprise risk management software.â The deal brings to a close the long-running saga to buy Misys. Last year, the British company rejected a bid by Fidelity National Information Services, a banking and payments technology company. Both companies could not agree to a price for the proposed takeover. Since then, the global financial crisis has taken its toll on Misys, which relies on the worldâs banks for the majority of its revenue. On Monday, the software company said revenue for the three months ended Feb. 29 had fallen 12 percent, to Â£89 million, compared with the period a year earlier. Barclays and JPMorgan Chase advised Misys on the deal, while Goldman Sachs advised Vista. Advertisement
