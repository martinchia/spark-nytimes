The Blackstone Group, which took the Hilton hotel group public on Thursday, has increased the value of its investment by nearly $10 billion through a combination of lucky timing, smart financial engineering and disciplined management. In the topsy-turvy world of private equity math, however, that huge gain might at first glance look like a multibillion-dollar loss, DealBookâs David Gelles writes. After all, the initial market capitalization of Hilton Worldwide Holdings on Thursday was $20 billion, compared with the headline-grabbing price of $26 billion that Blackstone paid when it took Hilton private in 2007. In buying the hotel company, Blackstone contributed about $5.5 billion of cash to the deal and borrowed about $20.5 billion from big banks. Over the next couple of years, the private equity firm used profits from Hilton to pay down that debt, opting against paying itself special dividends. When the financial crisis hit, Blackstone wrote down the value of its investment by more than half, causing the value of the banksâ debt to plummet. In 2009, it looked as if the Hilton deal could turn out to be a disaster. But Blackstone approached its lenders in 2010 and offered to restructure the deal, buying back some of the bank debt at a discount. Some lenders received just 35 cents on the dollar, while other lenders converted their debt into preferred equity. Blackstone agreed to inject more capital into the business, bringing its total equity investment to around $6.5 billion. Between its regular debt servicing, the restructuring in 2010 and proceeds from the initial public offering, Hilton will have about $12 billion in debt, down from $20.5 billion at the time of the buyout. âTheyâve accomplished a lot through leverage,â said Robert M. La Forgia, the chief financial officer of Hilton at the time of its sale, who now runs Apertor, a hospitality consultant firm. âThey almost lost the company, and might have without the debt restructuring.â A separate Blackstone I.P.O. paid some rather adorable dividends on Thursday. About a dozen kindergartners, and a few high-powered financiers, gathered at the firmâs Midtown Manhattan headquarters to get up close with eight animal ambassadors from Sea World, the theme park operator that the firm took public this year, DealBookâs Michael J. de la Merced reports. Among the dignitaries the group greeted were Pete and Penny, Magellanic penguins brought in from Sea Worldâs Orlando, Fla., park, in addition to Sophia and King, Eurasian eagle owls that hailed from Tampa, Fla., and San Diego. Shivers and Journey, Siberian huskies from Tampa, were also in attendance.  A FRESH MORTGAGE PENALTY FOR BANK OF AMERICA Â |Â âThe fallout from the bursting of the housing bubble continues to plague Wall Street,â Matthew Goldstein reports in DealBook. âBank of America agreed on Thursday to pay the Securities and Exchange Commission a $131.8 million penalty to settle an investigation linked to the structuring and sale of two complex mortgage securities that its Merrill Lynch division sold to investors. “The settlement arises from a series of collateralized debt obligations that Merrill Lynch cobbled together and marketed. The hedge fund Magnetar Capital, based in Evanston, Ill., had a role in helping pick some of the mortgage securities in the C.D.O.âs. The S.E.C., in an administrative order, accused Merrill Lynch of misleading investors by failing to disclose Magnetarâs role in influencing the selection of the underlying securities in the C.D.O.âs. Merrill Lynch also failed to disclose that the hedge fund had not only invested in the deal but was also shorting, or betting against, its performance in some instances, the S.E.C. said.â  ON THE AGENDA Â |Â  The producer price index for November is released at 8:30 a.m. Peter R.

The size of the financing round dwarfs the previous largest fund-raising effort by a Bitcoin company, Circle Internet Financial, which raised $9 million in October from investment firms including Accel Partners. âItâs hard to overstate the excitement of a certain segment of the technology community,â Chris Dixon, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz who will join Coinbaseâs board, said on Thursday. âEvery day somebody comes in and says, âBitcoin is going to be as big as the Internet.ââ       Â |Â  Contact: @williamalden | E-mail    Sign up for the DealBook Newsletter, delivered every morning and afternoon.   A.I.G.
