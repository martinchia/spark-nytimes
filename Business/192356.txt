LONDON â The private equity firm Pacific Equity Partners said on Tuesday that it was selling the Peters Food Group, one of Australiaâs oldest food brands, to R&R Ice Cream. The deal will combine the Peters ice cream brands, including Drumstick, Connoisseur and Peters Original, with R&Râs stable of brands, including manufacturing products for brands owned by Mondelez International and NestlÃ©.  Founded in 1985, R&R is the largest maker of store-branded ice cream in Europe and the second-largest maker of ice cream in Europe. The company has annual revenue of 681 million euros, or about $930 million. Terms of the deal were not announced. âWe are delighted to have come to an agreement with Peters and PEP,â Ibrahim Najafi, the R&R chief executive for Europe, said in a statement. âPeters is an iconic Australian business and the leader in the Australian ice cream manufacturing market; it will be an exciting complement to R&Râs European presence.â Pacific Equity Partners acquired Peters from NestlÃ© in August 2012. The company has annual revenue of roughly 269 million Australian dollars, or about $249 million. âWe are pleased that a company of R&Râs pedigree will help drive the future of the Petersâ business alongside the existing skilled and committed Australian management team,â said Tony Duthie, a Pacific Equity Partners managing director. Pacific Equity Partners was advised by Morgan Stanley and the law firm Allens. R&R was advised by Rothschild and the law firm Allen & Overy. Advertisement
