The CME Group said on Thursday that it had increased its offer to acquire the GFI Group, a New York brokerage and clearing house, as it tries to stave off a competing hostile bid by BGC Partners. In a news release, CME, which operates the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade and the New York Mercantile Exchange, said GFI shareholders would receive $5.60 a share in cash and stock under the latest revised offer. That is up from $5.25 a share in cash and CME stock proposed last month and 80 percent above GFI’s closing price before the first bid was announced in July. Shares of GFI rose 2 percent, to $5.56, in early trading in New York on Thursday. If it wins the bidding competition, CME plans to sell GFIâs wholesale brokerage business to a group led by GFIâs management. As part of the revised bid, the management consortium has agreed to pay about $282 million in cash, up from its previous offer of $254 million, CME said. The group would also assume $77 million of unvested compensation and other liabilities. The revised offer comes a day after BGC Partners, which is headed by Howard W. Lutnick, the chairman and chief executive of the investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, raised its own bid to $5.60 a share in cash.  On Thursday, CME said the terms of the revised transaction had been approved by GFIâs board, which continued to recommend that shareholders approve the deal. The deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval. A shareholder meeting is set for Jan. 27. If approved by shareholders, CME says it expects the transaction to close shortly thereafter.
