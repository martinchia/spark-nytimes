On Sept. 11, 2001, Britt Newhouse was the president of the Americas operations of Guy Carpenter & Company, a reinsurance intermediary and a subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan. Of the 295 Marsh employees who died in the attacks on Sept. 11, 29 were Guy Carpenter employees. Today, Mr. Newhouse is Guy Carpenterâs chairman. As told to Kevin Roose. I was there at 7:30 that morning. I had parked my car in Jersey City, by Exchange Place, and had come in on the PATH train. My office was on the 52nd floor, facing north over the plaza.   It was still the end of the summer, so I didnât have a suit on. I had on a pair of slacks and a collared shirt. I was answering e-mails in my office, cleaning up work from the night before, when the first plane hit. My first reaction was that there had been a steam explosion, or a gas tank. I didnât imagine it was up top.  It was the week of a major reinsurance convention, so the majority of the senior people in the office were overseas or out of the office. I was the C.E.O. of the Americas at that point, so I was the senior person in the office.  We waited 10 minutes and then decided to close the office. To be honest, we didnât need to tell people to leave. Weâd been in the tower in 1993, so our people were sensitized to the possibility of something bad happening.  As the office emptied out, I moved out to the switchboard in the main lobby and started answering the phones in the lobby, telling people, âWeâre closing the office. Go home.â There was one other employee and two secretaries still on the floor, and I said, âCome on, letâs go.â  Then the second plane hit. I donât remember the sound at all. I donât remember any noise. But I remember the fireball coming around and feeling like the building was going to topple. It swayed, like whoaaa, and then swayed back again. And the fireball disappeared.  I went into my office and grabbed my laptop and took it down. I guess I figured I wouldnât have it back for a while. Then the secretaries, the other guy and I went into the stairwell, and immediately it was totally full. We were all marching in cadence, and it was getting hotter and hotter and hotter as we went, like a giant toaster. Most people were afraid we would be consumed.  When we got downstairs, there were single-person escalators that took you down to the ground level. I went outside, and I stood in the Trinity Church yard looking at the buildings. The north tower looked like a round cave, with a dragon inside it, breathing fire. I could see people jumping. I debated with the people I was with, âUptown? Or to the river?â And I said, âIâm going to the river.â I walked to the river and got on a ferry. I didnât know where the boat was going. Taylor Collins was with me. He was a southern gentleman who wore a three-piece suit that day. He must’ve been hot. We didnât talk much. We were standing on the deck of the boat when the building came down. We thought they were explosions, but the building was pancaking. Everyone at home ran out to the driveway when I got out of the car. We embraced, and everyone was crying. I hadnât been able to call anyone to tell them I was alive.  The next morning, a car picked me up at 6:30 took me to Greenwich, Conn., where the senior management regrouped and tried to ascertain whom we had lost. We assumed weâd lost more than 300 people.  The company did an incredible job getting back to business and taking care of our families who had lost their loved ones. We raised a lot of money, but itâs never enough. My family and I were the lucky ones. And you wonder, sometimes, why me? I could have stayed another 10 or 15 minutes. My view is, Iâm incredibly fortunate to be alive. Iâm a little worried that trumpeting my survival or my experience somehow diminishes the real experience, the people who lost their families or were trapped in the fire.  Was it emotional? Yeah, it was emotional. But I guess you feel a responsibility to put the business back in place. And you want for the people who did get out, for them to survive and have a job. Thereâs no choice. You canât just stay home. Advertisement
