LONDON â The Royal Bank of Scotland said on Friday that it overstated its capital ratio in a recent European-wide stress test to examine its ability to survive a potential financial crisis or severe economic downturn. The bank, which is 81 percent owned by the British government after a bailout during the financial crisis, said that it did not properly recognize certain tax credits on theoretical losses as part of a stress test by the European Banking Authority.  As a result, R.B.S., based in Edinburgh, said that its âfully loadedâ common equity Tier 1 capital ratio in 2016 should have been 5.7 percent under an “adverse scenario,” essentially a future financial crisis, as part of the test, instead of the 6.7 percent that was reported. The capital ratio is an important measure of the bankâs ability to weather financial disturbances.  The new number is still above the minimum threshold set by the authority. âThis revised result was above the post-stress minimum ratio requirement of 5.5 percent used in the 2014 E.B.A. stress test for the adverse scenario,â the bank said in a statement. The error was identified as part of a review by the Bank of England after last month’s announcement of the stress test results and R.B.S. was asked to examine the issue more closely. The Bank of England notified the authority of the error on Friday and the results were immediately revised, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Friday. Shares of R.B.S. declined less than 1 percent, to Â£3.76, in late afternoon trading on Friday in London. In October, the authority and the European Central Bank announced the results of parallel reviews of the health of banks in the event of a future financial shock. The E.C.B. test, known as an asset quality review, focused on 130 banks in the 18-member euro currency bloc, while the authority’s test included additional banks in Britain, Sweden and other European Union countries outside the eurozone. The revision by R.B.S. related only to the stress test and didnât affect its reported common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.8 percent at the end of the third quarter, the bank said.  In its stress test, the authority identified 14 banks that fell short of the capital requirements and would need to add additional capital in case of a potential economic downturn in the future.  None of those banks were in Britain, and several had already undertaken efforts to bolster their capital before the results were announced. The Prudential Regulation Authority, a British financial watchdog, is expected to announce the results of its own stress test of British banks in mid-December. By JACK EWING The European Central Bank said of the 130 banks it reviewed, only 13 lacked sufficient capital to withstand a severe crisis. But some analysts question the rigor of the exam.
