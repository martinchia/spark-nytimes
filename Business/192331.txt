The company spent 100 million euros ($137 million) on store development and other projects last year and said it achieved growth for all brands —from couture label Armani Prive to AJ Armani Jeans —and in all markets. Though sales growth slowed from 16 percent in the previous year, the 2013 result was against the backdrop of a sector-wide deceleration as demand cooled in China and some parts of Europe struggled to pull out of recession. Armani outpaced its larger Italian rival Gucci at constant exchange rates, posting 8.3 percent growth against Gucci’s 2.2 percent, though it lagged behind Prada’s 13.3 percent. European operations performed well over all, with Britain and France leading the way, Armani said, helping the group lift full-year revenue to a record 2.19 billion euros, against 2.09 billion euros in 2012. The company also said it had bought the remaining 50 percent of fast-fashion line A/X Armani Exchange to take full ownership and total control over the brand and how it fits into the group’s portfolio. “The success of a brand lies in its ability to unite creativity and sales,” Giorgio Armani, the hands-on designer and group president who founded the company in 1975, said in a statement. Operating profit (EBIT) rose 18 percent to 401 million euros and the company had available cash of 700 million euros at the end of the year. The 100 million euros it invested in 2013 also included measures to improve supply chain efficiency. Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
