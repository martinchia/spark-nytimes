Annie’s Inc. apparently expects to reap a bounty in its initial public offering: The pasta maker has raised the price range for the sale, according to an amended prospectus filed on Monday. The company now expects to price its shares between $16 and $18, up from a previous range of $14 to $16. Annie’s, known for its organic and natural products (and its rabbit mascot), plans to sell 5 million shares in its offering. At the midpoint of its new range, the company would raise about $85 million, valuing it at $282.2 million. Nearly a fifth of the I.P.O.’s proceeds will be used to pay down Annie’s debt and other corporate purposes, with the bulk going to investors selling shares in the offering. Among those investors is Solera Capital, Annie’s biggest shareholder, which currently owns a 90.5 percent stake in the company. Based in Berkeley, Calif., the company has grown rapidly in recent years. It reported $596,000 in net income attributable to common shareholders in 2011, more than triple what it earned the year before and a swing from a loss in 2009. The company is expected to price its offering later this week, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BNNY. The I.P.O. is being led by Credit Suisse and JPMorgan Chase.
