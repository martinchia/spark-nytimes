In a recent column, I wrote about Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katzâs petition to amend the Section 13D reporting requirements. There is a reason why the prominent law firm is pushing the Securities and Exchange Commission to act: the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul.  The issue lies in Section 766(e) of the Dodd-Frank Act. This provision empowered the S.E.C. to make derivatives count for purposes of Section 13D reporting. And this new section specifically gives the agency the authority to make rules requiring investors to include cash-settled and other derivatives as part of their overall holdings. The portion of Dodd-Frank in question states that “a person shall be deemed to acquire beneficial ownership of an equity security based on the purchase or sale of a security based swap, only to the extent that [the SEC], by rule, determines after consultation with the prudential regulators and the Secretary of the Treasury.” Notice the use of the word âonly.â  Certain law firms and banks are arguing that the use of the word “only” means that no derivatives can be counted for Section 13D purposes unless the S.E.C. follows the rule-making procedures outlined in this section. Namely, the S.E.C. must consult with the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the secretary of the Treasury — and then it can promulgate rules on derivatives.   The problem is that the Section 13D rules already counted certain types of derivatives, namely any options, warrants or rights which were convertible into shares in 60 days. Now it is being argued by law firms and investment banks that Dodd-Frank nullifies the inclusion of all derivatives until the S.E.C. decides to act. Wachtell highlights this problem in its rule-making petition.   I am not aware of any hedge fund taking this position, and indeed it appears that market players continue to follow the existing rules. The reason why is that investors and other parties in times of uncertainty tend to adopt the more conservative position in order to avoid regulatory sanction.   There is no legislative history in the Dodd-Frank Act that I am aware of on Section 766(e), and I doubt Congress intended this new power to nullify the inclusion of all derivatives until the S.E.C. acted. It appears to be bad-drafting — one of a many instances in Dodd-Frank.   But Wachtell is absolutely right about the ambiguity. Wachtell is no doubt happy to use this uncertainty to push the S.E.C to act. And if the S.E.C. hashes out some new rules on Section 13D and derivatives, it could put all of the existing rules into play — including the length of the reporting period and the scope of penalties that currently do not permit companies to obtain monetary damages against investors who violate the disclosure rules.   If the S.E.C. acted to broaden the scope of Section 13D to cash-settled and other derivatives, it would be in good company. A number of countries, including Britain, Germany, Switzerland, Australia have recently acted on this matter. Hong Kong has also done so. But these are different regimes where smaller stakes can wield greater power. For example, in Britain, any shareholder with 3 percent of a company’s stock may call a meeting to replace directors at any time.  I briefly stated in my recent column that counting these derivatives does not raise the same issues as cutting the reporting period. It is worth elaborating.   In todayâs complex markets, a cash-settled equity derivative can be quickly converted into actual shares. The reason is that when a hedge fund purchases a cash-settled derivative, the bank on the other side will want to hedge that trade. The bank will do so by purchasing shares. So, when the cash-settled derivative is unwound or settled, the bank holds a large share position that needs to be sold. And the hedge fund may easily purchase these shares.   The problem is to properly balance the needs of hedge funds to keep their moves under the radar against the need of shareholders to have the appropriate information about share and derivative holders. It may be that when it comes to reporting cash-settled and other derivatives, the benefits of reporting these derivatives outweigh the detriments. It does not appear that hedge fund activity would be unduly chilled as would be the case if the 13D reporting period were shortened.   But the related — and perhaps more harmful — issue here is not the disclosure of the interest, but the potential for empty voting. Empty voting occurs when a person votes shares in which they do not have an economic interest. For example, take the investment bank that is a party to a cash-settled derivative agreement and that purchases shares to hedge its position. The bank’s economic interest is fully hedged.  But the bank still owns the shares it bought to hedge the transaction. The bank can vote these shares, but essentially has no economic interest in the outcome. That is because it does not stand to lose any money regardless of how the shares perform. It can, therefore, cast its votes in a manner that a normal shareholder would not — even in a way that is contrary to the interests of ordinary shareholders. Instances of this type of empty voting are rare, but there is the potential for harm.   In this light, perhaps the real remedy when it comes to derivatives and Section 13D is to sterilize the votes of the banks and other counterparties that hold shares only to hedge cash-settled and other derivatives. In other words, to go after the actual harm that empty voting can produce.   The relevant section of Dodd-Frank — the driving force behind Wachtellâs petition — requires the S.E.C. to go through a carefully considered process to regulate these derivatives.  Given the complexity of the issue, you can see why this is necessary.   Advertisement
