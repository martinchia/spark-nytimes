Reinstating an Old Rule Is Not a Cure for Crisis Â |Â  Since JPMorgan Chase announced its surprise $2 billion, and growing, trading loss there have been renewed calls from economists, pundits and politicians to reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that prevented commercial banks from participating in investment banking activities, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. A meme around Glass-Steagall has been created, repeated so often that it has almost become conventional wisdom: the repeal of Glass-Steagall led to the financial crisis of 2008. And, the thinking goes (the notion has become almost religious for some people), if the law were reinstated, we would avoid the next crisis. The facts â basic facts â are just not that convenient. While the repeal of Glass-Steagall has seemingly become the sine qua non of the financial crisis, it is pure historical revisionism. Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the most recent financial crisis. And it probably would not have prevented JPMorganâs $2 billion-plus trading loss. The loss occurred on the commercial side of the bank, not at the investment bank. But parts of the bet were made with synthetic credit derivatives â something that George Bailey in âItâs a Wonderful Lifeâ would never have touched. DealBook Â»   As Facebook’s Stock Struggles, Fingers Start Pointing Â |Â  As shares of Facebook tumbled in their second day of trading, bankers, investors and analysts wondered what had gone wrong with the initial public offering of the social network, the most highly anticipated technology debut in years. Some fingers are pointing at Morgan Stanley, the lead banker on the I.P.O., while others criticize Nasdaq and even Facebook itself. In the aftermath, critics contend that Facebookâs offering price was too high and too many shares were sold to the public, hurting the stockâs performance out of the gate. Facebookâs troubles could damp enthusiasm for a spate of companies set to go public in the coming months. It could also spur changes in the I.P.O. process. In particular, big institutional investors like Fidelity and Vanguard may demand greater say on pricing, at the expense of companies and their bankers.
