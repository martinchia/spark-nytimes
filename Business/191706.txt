AppDirect, a start-up focused on helping customers sell software online, said on Wednesday that it had raised $50 million in new financing to help it expand its staff worldwide. The round was led by an existing investor, Mithril Capital Management, a venture capital firm co-founded by the billionaire Peter Thiel and Ajay Royan. New investors include the private equity magnate Henry Kravis and Paul J. Fribourg, the chairman and chief executive of the ContiGroup. AppDirect, which was founded in 2009, specializes in letting clients sell and manage online software systems, better known as cloud software. Customers can find apps and pay for them through the companyâs platform. Among companies that use the AppDirect platform are ADP, Samsung and Comcast. In a statement, AppDirect, which is based in San Francisco, said that its revenue had more than doubled for the fourth consecutive year. It also expects to expand its staff to more than 300 employees, adding to offices in Munich and Montreal and opening one in Silicon Valley. âAppDirectâs high-quality growth and expanded product capabilities have cemented its leadership position in the new category of cloud service commerce,â Mr. Royan of Mithril said. âWe are proud to deepen our partnership with AppDirect.â A version of this article appears in print on 02/12/2015, on page B5 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Start-Up Financing.
