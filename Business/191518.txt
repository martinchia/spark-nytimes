Morgan Stanley said on Thursday said that it had promoted 151 employees to managing director, down slightly from 2014’s class of 153 managing directors. In 2013, it named 144 managing directors. Of those promoted on Thursday, 61 percent work in the United States, while 13 percent work in Asia. The other 26 percent work in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Women make up 22 percent of the 2015 class — a number that is above historical levels, the firm said. Â Morgan Stanley had nearly 56,000 employees as of the end of September. Roughly half of the new managing directors work in investment banking or in sales and trading. Those operations were once the firm’s dominant businesses, but in the years following the financial crisis, Morgan Stanley has been pushing into wealth management. The firm reports its fourth-quarter results on Tuesday. Advertisement
