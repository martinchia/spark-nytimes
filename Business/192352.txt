HONG KONG â Chinaâs commodities fraud scandal continues to widen, with more companies reporting losses on bogus aluminum and copper financing deals, while Chinese authorities now say gold contracts have also been faked to secure more than $15 billion in loans. On Thursday, a coal producer in the northeastern city of Taiyuan, in Shanxi Province, said it had filed a lawsuit to reclaim about $170 million it said it was owed. The producer named among the defendants is the Chinese company at the center of an investigation into aluminum and copper financing fraud at Qingdao Port, in northeastern Shandong Province. The lawsuit, filed by Shanxi Coal International Energy Group, claims that Dezheng Resources and one of its subsidiaries, Qingdao Decheng Mining â the two main companies under investigation in Qingdao for suspected fraud â had acted as guarantor in several contracts to import aluminum. The suit, which also names four other companies, is asking the high court in Shanxi Province to award two payments of $120.4 million and 352.5 million renminbi, or $57 million, that Shanxi Coal said it is owed because the defendants failed to honor their obligations under the contracts. News of the lawsuit came as Chinaâs top government auditor released a report on Tuesday indicating that gold had also been used in fraudulent commodities financing deals. The National Audit Office said that since 2012, it had conducted spot checks that caught 25 domestic gold producers conducting âfake tradesâ to secure loans with a value of 94.4 billion renminbi. These financing deals involved a form of illegal arbitrage between bank interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and yielded a profit of around 900 million renminbi, according to the auditor. The report did not identify the gold companies and banks involved or say whether anyone had been punished. Chinese companies have long relied on imported commodities like copper, aluminum and iron ore to obtain short-term financing, which is legal. But as the countryâs economic growth rate declines to the slowest pace in more than a decade, signs are emerging that at least some of these deals have been fictitious and fraudulent. In Qingdao, Chinese authorities are investigating whether Dezheng Resources acted with its subsidiaries to fraudulently obtain loans by pledging and re-pledging the same stockpiles of metals as collateral to multiple banks. Several Chinese and global banks are working to determine their level of exposure to potential losses in the Qingdao case, including Citigroup, Britainâs Standard Chartered Bank and South Africaâs Standard Bank. On Thursday, Standard Charteredâs chief executive, Peter Sands, said the bankâs total exposure to commodity-related financing in the Qingdao area was about $250 million. This amount was spread across multiple locations and multiple types of financing deals, ânot all of which will be affected by what appears to have happened,â he added. âOn the Qingdao situation, we’re obviously engaged in understanding and protecting our interest in what is quite a rapidly unfolding situation,â Mr. Sands said, speaking on a conference call for investors. âIt’s still quite unclear about what’s actually going on there.â Last week, Citic Resources, a Chinese state-owned commodities trader, said that about 100,000 tons of alumina, also known as aluminum oxide, had gone missing at the port in Qingdao. The company, which also produces oil and coal and is a unit of the state-owned conglomerate Citic Group, said in an announcement to the stock exchange in Hong Kong that it had secured a court order to secure about 253,000 tons of alumina and about 8,000 tons of copper to which it has legal title at the port of Qingdao. But Citic Resources said it had not been able to locate more than half of its alumina, worth an estimated $43 million. Qingdaoâs port ranks as the countryâs fifth-largest in terms of cargo handled, with around 12 percent of Chinaâs metal ore and 15 percent of crude oil shipments by volume, according to Qingdao Port International, the cityâs main port operator. The operator first disclosed the fraud investigation in a stock exchange filing on June 6. Advertisement
