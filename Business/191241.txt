Bank of America is still trying to get its arms around the big acquisitions it did amid the financial crisis. The bank may combine its Merrill Lynch subsidiary with the parent company as part of an effort to simplify its organization and reduce costs, Merrill Lynch said in a regulatory filing on Aug. 2. The merger could come as soon as the fourth quarter. Since buying Merrill Lynch at the start of 2009, Bank of America has operated it as a subsidiary. But a full merger with the parent company would allow Bank of America to assume Merrill’s obligations and debt, the filing said. It would also make corporate life simpler for the company, by reducing the number of legal entities and regulatory filings. For the last four and a half years, Merrill Lynch has filed quarterly and annual reports alongside Bank of America. With a merger, that would cease. But to most outsiders, the corporate reorganization would not be noticeable. The company has no plans to retire the Merrill Lynch brand for its retail brokerage and investment banking operations. “This will have no impact on how we serve our customers and our clients, and it will have no impact on the Merrill Lynch branded businesses that operate around the world,” Jerome F. Dubrowski, a spokesman for Bank of America, said on Friday. Bank of America’s plans were reported earlier on Friday by Bloomberg News. Bank of Americaâs intention to subsume Merrill stands in contrast to its handling of Countrywide, the large mortgage company it bought in 2008. After the purchase, Bank of America placed Countrywide in a separate subsidiary, a decision that has much relevance today. Bank of America is still swamped in expensive litigation related to Countrywideâs loans. The subsidiary has just less than $5 billion of assets, but the claims based on Countrywide loans will result in payouts that likely exceed $5 billion by a significant amount. Bank of America could place assets into the Countrywide subsidiary to pay off claims above $5 billion. But Countrywideâs legal separation may strengthen Bank of Americaâs hand as it tries to limit the cost of the litigation. If the claims against Bank of America start to climb even higher, the bank could in theory threaten not to put more assets into the subsidiary, which could result in sharply lower payouts to the plaintiffs. For instance, Bank of America has proposed an $8.5 billion settlement with bond investors over Countrywide loans. In June, a lawyer for the bank that helped negotiate the settlement told a New York state court that there was about $4.8 billion in the Countrywide entity to pay claims. Disputing the arguments of those who oppose settlement, the lawyer told the judge: âBut, your honor, all those coulda, woulda, shoulda are irrelevant if the pot of gold isn’t going to be there.” Advertisement
