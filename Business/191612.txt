7:52 p.m. | Updated  A California hedge fund manager has been charged with making illegal trades in Google and other technology stocks, the latest person to be ensnared in the governmentâs insider trading crackdown. Douglas F. Whitman, the founder of Whitman Capital in Menlo Park, Calif., surrendered to the F.B.I. in Manhattan on Friday. Federal prosecutors accused him of using confidential information to trade in the shares of Google, Marvell Technology and Polycom, netting $900,000 in illegal profit. The charges stem from the governmentâs investigation into the Galleon Group hedge fund, once run by Raj Rajaratnam, who is serving an 11-year prison sentence for insider trading. The case against Mr. Whitman hinges on tips prosecutors say he received from Roomy Khan, a former Intel executive and a tipster at the center of the Galleon case, and Karl Motey, a former technology industry analyst. Both have pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and are cooperating with authorities. Ms. Khan, a friend and neighbor of Mr. Whitmanâs, once rebuffed Mr. Whitmanâs request for insider tidbits for fear of getting caught, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed a parallel civil case on Friday. But Mr. Whitman pushed back, threatening to cut off their relationship if she wasnât going to be a cooperative anymore, the S.E.C. said. Mr. Whitman engaged in questionable activity and âtogether with Khan brought new illicit meaning to the maxim âhelp thy neighbor,ââ George S. Canellos, head of the S.E.C.âs New York office, said in a statement. Ms. Khan continued to pass illegal tips to Mr. Whitman, the S.E.C. says. In one case, Mr. Whitman made more than $600,000 placing a negative bet on Google after learning that the company was going to announce a poor quarter. Afterward, as  a thank-you, Mr. Whitman sent Ms. Khan a large floral arrangement. In the Federal District Court in Manhattan on Friday afternoon, Mr. Whitman pleaded not guilty. He was released on $1.5 million bail. âMr. Whitman traded on the basis of lawful research and analysis, not unlawfully obtained inside information,â his lawyer, David L. Anderson of Sidley Austin, said in a statement. Mr. Anderson added that Ms. Khan has an incentive to drum up charges against Mr. Whitman to avoid a lengthy prison sentence. Her claims âare false and will be proved false.â Mr. Whitman, 54, of Atherton, Calif., has had a long career investing in technology stocks. He set up Whitman Capital in 1994, according an article from Red Herring magazine, and in his first year was up more than 100 percent. Before setting up his own fund, he worked as an analyst for several Wall Street firms noted for their technology industry research, including Alex. Brown & Sons, Hambrecht & Quist and Montgomery Securities, all now owned by big banks. His fund has about $120 million in assets under management, according to the S.E.C.âs complaint. According to a November 2011 securities filing, Whitman Capital had holdings in several chip makers and networking companies, including Marvell Technology, Brocade Communications and Riverbed Technology. In a 2006 interview with Barronâs, Mr. Whitman had pitched Marvell â a stock that government says he illegally traded â as one of his top picks. The case continues the governmentâs multiyear campaign to root out insider trading on Wall Street and beyond. Called âOperation Perfect Hedge,â the investigation has led to more than 60 guilty pleas or convictions. About half of the 64 charged so far are connected to the Galleon case. âAs todayâs charges show, our efforts to police the securities marketplace are unwavering,â Janice K. Fedarcyk, the head of the F.B.I.âs New York office, said in a statement.
