Michael L. Corbat has kept a relatively low profile since taking the helm of Citigroup in October 2012. And that appears to be just fine with the bank he runs, Susanne Craig and Jessica Silver-Greenberg report in DealBook. âTo be a prominent face of Wall Street at a time when banks are feeling the heat from federal authorities on a number of fronts clearly has its drawbacks. Mr. Corbatâs counterpart at rival JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, has been widely viewed as the point man for the bank as it wrestles with investigations by at least seven federal agencies, several state regulators and two foreign nations. And under Mr. Dimon, JPMorgan has in just a few years gone from a Washington favorite to a magnet for government scrutiny. “The low-key approach taken by Citigroup â which faces a number of investigations of its own â has not gone unnoticed inside JPMorgan. Some board members and executives there have recently pointed to Mr. Corbat in privately discussing the apparent advantages of a more self-effacing approach in a chief executive. The perks of a lower profile have become clear to Mr. Dimon, too, according to people close to him who note he has recently refrained from giving interviews to focus, in part, on client meetings. “JPMorganâs board, of course, remains solidly behind Mr. Dimon. But at least two directors, people close to the board say, have also privately acknowledged that Mr. Dimonâs previous offhandedness toward authorities â including his referring several years ago to the former Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner as âTimmyâ â at times rankled regulators, adding to the steep challenge the bank faces as it now tries to mend those frayed relationships.â  A STRONG MONTH FOR HEDGE FUNDS Â |Â  November is shaping up to be the month that puts many hedge funds solidly in the black for the year, at least judging by the performance of two closely watched portfolios, Matthew Goldstein reports in DealBook. David Einhornâs Greenlight Capital reported a 4.7 percent gain for the month, putting the firmâs flagship fund up about 19.1 percent for the year, according to an investor with knowledge of the matter. Another firm that reported early, Daniel Loebâs Third Point, also had a strong November, Mr. Goldstein reports. Its flagship fund, Third Point Partners, was up 2.7 percent for November and is now up 23.2 percent for the year, while the more leveraged Third Point Ultra fund is now up 33.4 percent for the year, after rising 3.6 percent in November.    T-MOBILEâS BRASH C.E.O. KEEPS RIVALS OFF BALANCE Â |Â  T-Mobile had all but been given up for dead two years ago, when its owner, Deutsche Telekom, agreed to sell it to AT&T and was already describing the business as a âdiscontinuedâ operation in its financial statements. But then came John J. Legere. Named chief executive of T-Mobile in September 2012, after the antitrust division of the Justice Department sued to block the proposed merger and AT&T threw in the towel, Mr. Legere quickly started shaking up the industry, James B. Stewart writes in the Common Sense column in The New York Times. âMr. Legere not only looked but also acted the part of the âdisruptiveâ competitor beloved by antitrust regulators but all too rare in most concentrated industries (there are just four major cellular carriers). He branded T-Mobile the âUn-carrierâ and took square aim at the staid giants of the industry, AT&T and Verizon, publicly describing them with language that canât be printed in this newspaper,â Mr. Stewart writes. âThis might have been dismissed as little more than a colorful stunt, given the depth of T-Mobileâs problems. But then the results started rolling in.â How did he do it? When he joined T-Mobile, âWe had a limited time window and a sense of urgency,â Mr. Legere told Mr. Stewart. âWe were losing over two million customers a year. So we moved as fast as we humanly could. My board wondered if we were doing too much. But the fact is, speed has become one of our biggest weapons. The current industry is arrogant, stupid and slow, which gives companies like T-Mobile a real competitive advantage.â  DELIVERY BY DRONE? Â |Â  If Jeff Bezos has his way, Amazonâs future delivery system will run on drones. On â60 Minutesâ on Sunday night, Mr. Bezos, the Amazon founder, floated the notion of using drones to deliver packages, showing Charlie Rose a video of a tiny helicopter seizing a package from a warehouse and airlifting it to a house. âI know this looks like science fiction. Itâs not,â Mr. Bezos said. Still, he cautioned that there were âyears of additional work from this point.â The hardest challenge, he said, would be convincing the Federal Aviation Administration that this is a good idea.    ON THE AGENDA Â |Â  The ISM manufacturing index for November is released at 10 a.m. The restructuring expert James E.

Completed just last Wednesday and scheduled for release on Christmas Day, the two-hour, 59-minute cinematic romp through the securities business is Mr. Scorseseâs longest film ever. Will the picture do for crooked stock traders what Mr. Scorseseâs âGoodfellasâ did for the mob, or will it become a problem for the executives at Paramount? âFor Paramount, the stakes are not inconsiderable. Though the Viacom-owned studio had spring-summer hits in âStar Trek Into Darknessâ and âWorld War Z,â it is running last among the major studios, with only about $823 million in domestic ticket sales, roughly half those of first-place Warner Brothers,â The Times writes.
