Advertisement Supported by Business Briefing By The Associated Press Target is “respectfully” asking its customers to not bring firearms into its stores, even where it is allowed by law. In a statement posted Wednesday on Target’s corporate blog, the interim chief executive, John J. Mulligan, said, “This is a complicated issue, but it boils down to a simple belief: Bringing firearms to Target creates an environment that is at odds with the family-friendly shopping and work experience we strive to create.” In many states, carrying unconcealed guns in public is legal. Molly Snyder, a Target spokeswoman, said that Target’s move was a “request and not a prohibition.” Target does not sell guns in its stores or on its website. A group called Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America gathered nearly 400,000 signatures for a petition asking the company to prohibit shoppers from carrying guns. The group has said it is responsible for getting several chains like Starbucks and Chipotle to make similar moves.  Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
