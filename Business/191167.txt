 The Dow Jones industrial average hit a nominal record on Friday, but without much conviction after a choppy day of trading. The blue-chip index flitted between small gains and losses at least a dozen times, and ended up beating the high it set last week by under 2.5 points, or just 0.02 percent. The Dow edged up 32.37 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,583.34. That narrowly beat its previous high of 16,580.84 set on April 30. “The market is having trouble finding direction here,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J. P. Morgan Funds. But he said that “a warming economy” in the rest of the year would push the market up. On Friday, stocks fell broadly from the open as investors took in the latest corporate earnings reports. It was an odd day in which winners became losers, and vice versa. Advertisement Stocks of utilities have been in favor lately because of their stable earnings and robust dividends, but investors dumped them on Friday, and they closed 1.4 percent lower. That was the biggest drop of the S.&P. 500’s 10 sectors. Advertisement By contrast, a few big-name Internet stocks that had been crushed in a recent sell-off in that industry managed healthy gains. Netflix announced it was raising prices for new subscribers of its streaming video service and investors cheered, lifting its stock 2.14 percent, to $328.55. Tesla Motors rose 2 percent and LinkedIn 2.5 percent; both were down more than 10 percent since April. Tesla rose to $182.26, up $3.67. LinkedIn gained $3.62, to $148.69. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index also eked out a gain, but is no higher than it was in early March, after waffling between weekly gains and losses most of that time. It rose 2.85 points, or 0.15 percent, to 1,878.48. The Nasdaq composite index gained 20.37 points, or 0.5 percent, to 4,071.87. Mixed messages from earnings reports left investors without clear direction. CBS slid $1.27, or 2.19 percent, to $56.74, after reporting late Thursday that its first-quarter revenue had fallen short of analysts’ projections. Sales from advertising slumped 12 percent. Ralph Lauren dropped $3.18, or 2.09 percent, to $148.81, after its forecast for sales for the current quarter disappointed investors.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Hilton Worldwide Holdings jumped 43 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $23.07, after exceeding analysts’ expectation for earnings. Gap rose $1.28, or 3.26 percent, $40.52. The clothes store chain reported strong sales for April and issued a forecast for the current quarter that was better than investors were expecting. Advertisement With most companies out with their results, first-quarter earnings for the S.&P. 500 are expected to rise 3.4 percent, according to S&P Capital IQ. That’s a respectable performance but still down from a nearly 8 percent gain in the fourth quarter. Among other stocks making big moves was Symantec, the security software maker, which climbed 66 cents, or 3.29 percent, to $20.79. The company said cost cuts helped increase its fourth-quarter profit margins and net income. News Corporation rose 89 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $18. The publishing company, which owns The Wall Street Journal, said net income fell in its fiscal third quarter, but still beat expectations on gains in book publishing. That unit thrived because of the “Divergent” series, which made its debut as a movie in March. The Commerce Department reported on Friday that wholesale businesses increased their stockpiles in March by the largest amount in five months while sales increased at the fastest pace in 10 months. Wholesale stockpiles rose 1.1 percent in March after a 0.7 percent gain in February. It was the ninth consecutive monthly gain and the largest increase since a 1.2 percent rise in October. Sales at the wholesale level were up 1.4 percent, the best showing since a 1.9 percent rise in May 2013. The sizable gain in sales should encourage businesses to keep restocking their shelves to meet rising demand. That will mean increased orders to factories and rising production which would increase economic growth. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.62 percent, from 2.61 percent on Thursday. Its price fell 3/32, to 98 30/32.
