Six years ago, after leaving a high-powered career in fashion sales to become a stay-at-home mother of very young children, Amy Gottesman found herself missing her income — and looking for something to do when her kids were napping. So Ms. Gottesman, who lives on Long Island, put up a Web site under the name of Smash Party Entertainment, offering entertainment for parties, ranging from casinos to living Roman “statues” to murder mysteries. And then she waited for the business to come in — which it didn’t, even though she was advertising in local newspapers and mailing out coupons. After three months of staring at the phone, she decided to try $20 worth of pay-per-click advertising through Google’s AdWords service, which placed her short ads alongside the search results for certain keywords, as well as on some Web pages with content related to those keywords. “In a few days,â she said, âthe phone started ringing.”  Encouraged, she started playing around with different ads geared to different keywords — and business took off. After about six months, Smash Party was spending as much as $3,000 a month on pay-per-click advertising and getting back about six times as much in revenue. BeyoncÃ©’s people found Ms. Gottesman through AdWords and hired her to provide entertainers, as did the White House. “Who would have thought people like that just go and Google things?” she said. Well, everyone “Googles” everything, of course. But you get her point. Actually, it is kind of surprising how common it is for people to look for products and services in those little classified-ad-style listings on search pages and Web sites. The world is spending more than $20 billion a year on pay-per-click advertising through Google alone — Yahoo and Microsoft’s Bing jointly offer pay-per-click services too, as does AOL — and most of it is from small and mid-sized companies. To be sure, Ms. Gottesman’s efforts have been unusually fruitful, and for several reasons. For one, she has a good feel for the different types of entertainment party-throwers might want. “I don’t do comedians and D.J.’s,” she said. “I handpick the talent I use, and then I create costumes and music to go beyond the norm.” She uses freelance entertainers, most of whom hunt her down looking for work, and she runs her business with only one full-time employee. She anticipates new trends in party entertainment, which can change month by month, often based on what’s hot on TV and in Hollywood. Right now, for example, 1950’s-style smoky, Rat-Packy kitsch a la “Mad Men” is hot, and corset-and-feather burlesque is on the rise thanks to the new Cher movie. She also runs a slick Web site to reel in prospective customers. But there’s no question that a big part of Ms. Gottesman’s success is her mastery of the art of divining the right keywords to invest in. She used to put up obvious keyword phrases that included “party,” generating huge numbers of clicks from people who were looking for party planners and table rentals. Then she focused on phrases that describe the sorts of offbeat entertainers she offers, such as “cigarette girls,” and “body-painted mermaids,” ending up with fewer clicks but higher sales. And she constantly tries out new phrases as a way of catching the attention of potential customers her competitors might be missing. Most entrepreneurs aren’t likely to match Ms. Gottesman’s success in the pay-per-click world. She notes that some of her perfectly smart friends with good business ideas haven’t been very good at it — they end up relying on Ms. Gottesman to help them pick phrases. And some businesses simply may not lend themselves to pay-per-click at all. In fact, Ms. Gottesman is starting a second business called Green Light Deal — she doesn’t want me to tell you much about it yet — but she doesn’t see a way to make pay-per-click pay off for it because too many big organizations are competing in this arena for too few relevant keywords. But you don’t know until you try. And if you do try, here’s a big mistake to avoid: Giving up too quickly. According to Frederick Vallaeys, whose title at Google is “AdWords Evangelist,” new advertisers often try putting up an ad or two based on a handful of keywords — but when they don’t get many people to click on them, they just figure pay-per-click isn’t for them. Sometimes they’ll spend too much money on this initial discouraging experience before fleeing for good. Instead, counsels Mr. Vallaeys, put in just a little money for several weeks — as little as $1 a day if that’s all you feel comfortable parting with — and don’t make any decisions until a few hundred people have clicked on your ads. At that point you’ll have enough data to enable Google’s tools to advise you on how to improve your results. “A fair number of advertisers lose money at first,” Mr. Vallaeys said. “You have to wait until you see what’s really going on with your clicks.” That’s what Ms. Gottesman did to build her quirky entertainment company into a steady business with six-figure annual revenues. Even after six years and plenty of good word of mouth, the company still gets nearly two-thirds of its business through pay-per-click. “If I stopped advertising that way,” she said, “the business would instantly die.” And then where would BeyoncÃ© go for body-painted mermaids? On Thursday, in Part 2 of this post, I’ll enlist more of Ms. Gottesman’s and Mr. Vallaeys’s wisdom to describe six more key mistakes that keep many small businesses from getting as much out of pay-per-click advertising as they could.
