The combination of Publicis and Omnicom looked great on paper, but its idea was sorely misjudged. The merger of the two advertising agency companies was called off after it became clear the deal could not be completed in a reasonable time frame, the two said on May 9. From up high, the French-American union was a triumph of financial logic. The companies were nearly identical in size and in earnings. Savings of $500 million created value, but didnât suggest huge cuts. The chief executive of Publicis, Maurice LÃ©vy, Â and Omnicom Groupâs John Wren would have run the enlarged company, called Publicis Omnicom, together for 30 months. Mr. Wren would then have become sole chief executive and Mr. LÃ©vy chairman.  What Mr. Levy and Mr. Wren failed to account for was human behavior. While their own management transition appeared elegant, it left plenty of room for bickering at lower levels. Key roles, like chief financial officer, remained undecided. Advertising is a people business, and itâs not clear that scale brings more creative ideas. Even shareholders were lukewarm â the stocks of both companies are barely higher than when the union was unveiled. Regulators too were slow to approve the deal. Chinaâs antitrust watchdog, which was yet to assent, may simply have behaved with characteristic torpor, but Franceâs tax regulator may have legitimately asked why it should assist a deal that moves the companyâs tax residence to Britain, helping shift $80 million a year from government coffers to shareholders. Perhaps the biggest reason for conscious uncoupling was clients. The companiesâ biggest rival, the WPP Group, had proclaimed that companies like PepsiCo and Vodafone were shifting their loyalties. Even if that was just part of the normal cycle of agency rotation — and the spin machine of WPP’s chief executive, Martin Sorrell — itâs unlikely that clients and media companies would have benefited from reduced competition. All decent ad executives know that if the client doesnât buy the concept, itâs just not going to work. John Foley is Reuters Breakingviews China editor.
