MF Global’s chief risk officer is set to tell Congress on Thursday that he did not sound the alarms about the firm’s risky wagers on European sovereign debt until July, about three months before the firm collapsed into bankruptcy.  Michael Stockman joined MF Global after Michael Roseman, the firm’s previous risk chief, clashed with the firmâs top executives about the European debt positions. Mr. Roseman argued that the bets could sour and wanted Jon S. Corzine, the firm’s chief executive and the architect of the bond plan, to seek approval from the board if he wanted to expand the bets.  The board sided with Mr. Corzine. And when Mr. Stockman took over in early 2011, he did not immediately adopt his predecessor’s skepticism.  “For the first several months of my tenure, based on analyses performed by my department, I believed that the risk profile associated with the companyâs European sovereign debt position was acceptable in light of then-prevailing market conditions,” Mr. Stockman said in prepared testimony to be delivered before a House panel on Thursday. He added that his risk department team “regularly analyzed” the company’s positions.  MF Global collapsed on Oct. 31 amid a crisis of confidence after it was publicly revealed that regulators were growing concerned that Mr. Corzine had placed a big bet on European sovereign bonds. Mr. Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey, had wagered that the European Union would not let nations like Ireland and Portugal default.  Mr. Stockman is prepared to say that he did not raise concerns about the bet until July.  “As credit markets deteriorated in the summer of 2011, I came to the view that it would be prudent for the company to mitigate the increased risks associated with its European sovereign debt trading position, and to consider entering into hedging transactions to reduce the companyâs exposure,” he said in the testimony.  He conveyed his concerns to “senior management” and explored ways to wind down the risk, Mr. Stockman said in the prepared remarks.  In August, he then outlined his concerns in presentations to MF Global’s board.   “In my view, the board and senior management were highly sophisticated; they knew and understood how the” positions worked, he said, adding that “they were well aware of the increased risks caused by weakening market conditions.” The board finally heeded the warnings. In his testimony, Mr. Stockman said the board ceased adding to the debt purchases.  But it was too late. Regulators were already breathing down on the firm, and within two months, it would be in bankruptcy.  Mr. Stockman is to testify on Thursday before the oversight panel of the House Financial Services Committee, which will hold the fourth Congressional hearing on MF Global’s downfall. The committee is to hear from both Mr. Stockman and Mr. Roseman, offering the first opportunity for the risk officers to explain their oversight on the European bond positions. The committee is also to hear from executives at rating agencies that were slow to respond to MF Global’s swift downfall.  Mr. Stockman is not expected to shed any light on another question swirling around MF Global: what happened to $1.2 billion in customer money that vanished when the firm collapsed?  “I have no personal knowledge of any missing funds or unreconciled customer accounts,” he said. “Like everyone else, I am very hopeful that all missing customer funds will be located and promptly returned to the rightful owners.” Advertisement
