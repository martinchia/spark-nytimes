Pershing Square Capital Management, the hedge fund run by the activist investor William A. Ackman, has sued Allergan, the target of a hostile bid from Pershing Square and Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Pershing Square is seeking to call a special meeting of Allergan shareholders later this year, at which it hopes to vote in new board members who would support the deal, which is valued at $53 billion. But Pershing Square contends that Allergan has not made it clear whether or not calling the meeting would set off its shareholder rights plan, or Â poison pill, which would substantially dilute shareholders, including Pershing Square with its nearly 10 percent stake. By not making that clear, Allergan is effectively postponing any potential meeting. On Friday, Pershing Square sued Allergan in Delaware court, seeing a declaratory judgment that would clarify whether calling a meeting would trigger the pill. âWe regret that we were forced to file this lawsuit,” Mr. Ackman said in a statement. “Allerganâs failure to confirm that its poison pill does not apply to the actions taken in furtherance of calling a special meeting is a blatant attempt to frustrate shareholdersâ ability to express their views and exercise their rights.” Pershing Square said it requested confirmation from Allergan on June 6 that calling a meeting would not set off the poison pill. Allergan’s counsel replied on Wednesday but “failed to provide the confirmation requested,” Pershing Square said. However, Allerganâs letter on Wednesday includes a relatively straightforward reply to the main question Pershing Square posed. As long as Pershing Square does not own more than 10 percent of shares, calling a special meeting âshould not, of itselfâ trigger the pill. But Pershing Square said the devil was in the details. Allerganâs corporate bylaws contain several provisions that have left Pershing Square unsure what assistance it can provide other shareholders, who will have to file proxies to call the meeting. Pershing Square said it requested clarification about these points but that Allergan did not reply. âIt would nonetheless be all but impossible to provide full and complete responses to the remaining questions set forth in your letter given the important factual nuances,â Allerganâs lawyers wrote in their reply. Allerganâs counsel concluded by offering Pershing Square the opportunity to discuss the matter on a conference call. Though the two sides had talked before the latest exchange of letters, according to people briefed on the matter, Pershing Square never called back. Instead, it sued. âUsing a poison pill to silence shareholders or prevent them from exercising their voting rights is unlawful,â Pershing Square said in a statement. The lawsuit is the latest move in what has become one of the most convoluted and contentious deals in recent memory. Allergan declined to comment. At the same time, Valeantâs share price has continued to decline. Since Valeant and Pershing Square announced their bid for Allergan, shares in Valeant have fallen 5 percent. The current cash and stock offer has a value of about $170 for each Allergan share. That is well below the $180 a share that the offer was worth two weeks ago, when Valeant raised its bid for a second time. William A. Ackman answers why he thinks Valeantâs potential takeover of Allergan is beneficial, and the âunprecedentedâ terms behind the hostile bid. Advertisement
