In the latest pairing of Silicon Valley and Washington, Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary and chief economic adviser to President Obama, has joined the board of Square, a technology start-up. âWe are proud to have Larry join our board and we welcome his insight and decades of leadership to our growing company,â Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Square, said in a statement. âSquare is at a key point in our trajectory and we know Larry will contribute tremendous wisdom and expertise toward our continued success.â  It’s a notable addition for Square, a rising mobile payments company based in San Francisco that facilitates credit card transactions on mobile devices. Square, which is said to be in the middle of a fund-raising round that would value the company at more than $1 billion, is best known for its roster of technology power players. Besides Mr. Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter, Square is also led by its chief operating officer, Keith Rabois, a prominent angel investor and early employee of PayPal and LinkedIn. Its board includes Vinod Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems and a clean-technology venture capitalist, and Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital.  In contrast, Mr. Summers is a D.C. veteran.  A former president of Harvard, Mr. Summers served in both the Clinton and Obama administrations. He joined the National Economic Council in 2009 and most recently served as President Obama’s chief economic adviser. His ties to Capitol Hill and the White House could be a major asset for Square, which is operating in the fast-evolving world of mobile payments. The market — which is currently a jumble of start-ups, technology giants and traditional financial institutions — could face more scrutiny as it grows since it is under the umbrella of the oft-regulated financial services industry.  The appointment comes as other technology start-ups try to strengthen their political ties. Last month, Facebook hired Joel Kaplan, a former member of President George W. Bushâs White House staff, to lead its Washington office. Other notable political insiders at Facebook include its general counsel, Ted Ullyot, a former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, and its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, a former chief of staff to Mr. Summers when he was Treasury secretary.
