Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press The stock market finished mostly lower on Thursday as investors assessed the latest company earnings and sold utility and energy stocks. Tesla Motors, a maker of electric cars, fell after reporting a first-quarter loss and saying it would need to invest more in its business. Utilities and other companies that pay steady dividends and have a long record of profitability have surged this year, benefiting from a shift in sentiment as investors sold previously high-flying Internet and small-company stocks. A sell-off in these stocks could be a troubling sign for the overall market. “The market’s still pretty sloppy,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The fear in the market is that the selling spreads to the defensive stocks, the safe havens, and that could bring down the whole market.” The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 2.58 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,875.63. The Nasdaq composite index lost 16.18 points, or 0.4 percent, to 4,051.50. Still, the Dow Jones industrial average edged up 32.43 points, or 0.2 percent, to 16,550.97. Utility companies in the S.&P. 500 fell 1.2 percent, paring their gains this year to 12.5 percent. Energy stocks fell 1.3 percent. Stocks had started the day higher as investors looked over earnings reports and after some encouraging news on the job market. The government reported that the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell 26,000 last week to 319,000. Keurig Green Mountain, a maker of specialist coffees, was among the day’s big gainers after reporting earnings that exceeded analysts’ estimates. The company climbed $11.98, or 13 percent, to $104.19.  Twenty-First Century Fox was another winner, rising $2.10, or 6.5 percent, to $34.22 after it also reported earnings that surpassed analysts’ expectations.  Tesla was among the day’s losers, falling $22.76, or 11.3 percent, to $178.59. The company, which makes electric cars, reported a $49.8 million first-quarter loss late Wednesday and said that spending on investments would weigh on earnings later this year.  Almost 90 percent of companies in the S.&P. 500 have now reported first-quarter earnings. Overall earnings are expected to grow by 3.3 percent in the quarter, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. That compares with growth of almost 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013 and 5.2 percent a year earlier. Revenue also grew in the first quarter, rising 3.3 percent compared with 1.6 percent growth in the fourth quarter, a positive sign that companies are experiencing stronger demand. Some investors say that companies are still relying too much on cost-cutting to generate earnings growth. “It remains to be seen whether companies can continue to grow in what remains, by many measure, a slow-growing economy,” said Tom Karsten, chief investment officer at Karsten Advisors, a financial adviser and investment management company. The Dow, consisting of 30 big blue-chip companies, has started to outperform other areas of the stock market as investors have sold small companies and growth-oriented stocks. The Russell 2,000 index, which tracks small company stocks, is down 9.2 percent since March 4. Last year when stocks were surging, small companies were among the biggest gainers. Among the stocks on the move, Ford gained 35 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.81 after the automaker said it would buy back up to $1.8 billion of its own stock. Twitter, which has endured a rough ride since surging on the first day of its initial public offering in November, rose $1.30, or 4.2 percent, to $31.96. The company’s stock has plunged 52 percent since February. In the bond market, interest rates moved higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.61 percent from 2.59 percent late Wednesday, while its price fell 3/32, to 99 1/32.  Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
