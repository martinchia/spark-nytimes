The Securities and Exchange Commission is involved in an increasingly heated battle with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the Shanghai-based accounting firm that discovered bookkeeping fraud at Longtop Financial Technologies of China, over access to the financial software company’s records. On Thursday, the S.E.C., which is conducting its own fraud investigation of Longtop, said it had asked the Federal District Court in Washington to order Deloitte, which had been Longtop’s auditor, to comply with a subpoena to turn over those records. The S.E.C. noted that it had issued the subpoena on May 27 to Deloitte, which it said was “in possession of vast amounts of documents,” but that the firm had not yet turned over any records. As a result, the S.E.C. said it was stymied in its investigation. âCompliance with an S.E.C. subpoena is not an option, it is a legal obligation,â Robert Khuzami, the S.E.C.’s enforcement director, said in a statement.  âThe ability of the S.E.C. to conduct swift and thorough investigations requires that subpoena recipients promptly comply with that legal obligation.  Subpoena recipients who refuse to comply should expect serious legal consequences.â after several years of giving Longtop a clean bill of financial health, Deloitte resigned as the company’s auditor in May, when it discovered the company did not have the cash it claimed and that there were “significant bank borrowings” not reflected on its books. Deloitte said Longtop’s chairman, Jia Xiao Gong, had told a Deloitte partner that there was ”fake cash recorded on the books” because there had been ”fake revenue in the past.”  Shares of Longtop had traded on the New York Stock Exchange, where the company was valued at as much as $2.4 billion at its peak in November. But since the accounting irregularities were discovered, trading was halted and Longtop delisted, with its shares becoming virtually worthless.   Advertisement
