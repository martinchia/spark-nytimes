Taiwan’s financial regulator said on Thursday that it would support the sale of American International Group‘s local unit, Nan Shan Life Insurance, for $2.2 billion to a consortium led by Ruen Chen Investment Holding.  The approval signals the beginning of the end for a nearly two-year ordeal for A.I.G., which has divested itself of many of its Asian units but ran into particular resistance in Taiwan, where officials feared that the company’s four million policyholders might fall into the wrong hands.  The Financial Supervisory Commission said in a statement that Ruen Chen, the holding company of the Taiwan conglomerate Ruentex Group, would have to place 6 billion Taiwan dollars, or $208 million, in an account to act as a deposit.  Ruen Chen will also need regulatory approval before it can use Nan Shan for a number of financial transactions or investments, including simply taking out a loan.  A.I.G. announced the deal with Ruentex in January after a first agreement with a consortium based in Hong Kong and mainland China fell through.  At the time, the insurer said it would sell its 97.57 percent stake in Nan Shan to a consortium composed of the Ruen Chen Group, which would own 80 percent, and the shoemaker Pou Chen, which would hold the rest of the stake.  The American insurerâs long attempt to separate from Nan Shan has been part of a wider sale aimed at raising money to repay its $180 billion bailout by the United States government.   A.I.G sold two Japanese insurance units last year for $4.8 billion, took its Hong Kong unit, American International Assurance, public for $20.5 billion and sold another business, Alico, to MetLife for $15.5 billion.  A.I.G. employed Debevoise & Plimpton and Lee & Li as legal advisers on the Nan Shan deal. Advertisement
