As MF Global filed for bankruptcy on Monday, it used lawyers who know some of its operations rather well — since they helped sell them six years ago. Leading the Chapter 11 filing for MF Global’s parent company is the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, which was added to the brokerage firm’s coterie of advisers in recent days. Skadden had previously advised a predecessor to MF Global, Refco, when that firm filed for bankruptcy in 2005 after disclosing accounting fraud by its chief executive, Philip Bennett. A Skadden team led by J. Gregory Milmoe supervised bidding for the failed brokerage firm’s assets, which became a hotly contested auction among several financial firms. (In a 2007 profile in The American Lawyer, Mr. Milmoe described the bidding as “a Wild West shoot-out.”) The Man Group emerged the victor, agreeing to pay some $323 million for Refco’s futures trading arm. Those operations now form a significant part of MF Global, which the Man Group spun off in 2007.  MF Global was felled for different reasons than its predecessor’s. Among its biggest problems was a big wager on European sovereign debt by its chief executive, Jon S. Corzine, that soured as the continent’s fiscal crisis deepened this year. The firm was also whipsawed by global market volatility that hurt its trading operations. Mr. Milmoe is among the Skadden partners working on the firm’s Chapter 11 case, according to court filings. For deal trivia aficionados, there’s a twist in the story. Among the firms that the Man Group bested in 2005 was the Interactive Brokers Group, which was in talks to buy some of MF Global’s assets until Monday morning, according to people briefed on the matter.
