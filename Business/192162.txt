Lloyds, the biggest British retail bank that was partially nationalized during the credit crisis, said it was set for decent 2010 results as bad debts fell and margins continued to improve, Reuters reported. “We continue to expect the group to deliver a good financial performance for the full year,” the bank said in a third-quarter update on Tuesday. Lloyds kicked off the third-quarter updates from major banks, with Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC due to follow suit later this month. It said losses from problem loans were “expected to fall moderately” in the second half, in line with its recent guidance, and that margins should show a modest improvement. The bank added that its capital ratios were strong and slightly higher than those reported at the half-year stage, when Lloyds reported a Tier 1 core capital ratio of 9.0 percent. Lloyds shares rose 0.6 percent, to 70 pence, in morning trading. Separately, the planned sale of several hundred British retail bank branches is unlikely to occur in 2010, although the company is sticking with its deadline of selling them by 2013, the bank’s chief executive, Eric Daniels, told Reuters. “If I were to give you the best view, we have 58 days left for this year. That would probably speak for itself,” Mr. Daniels said on Tuesday. “We have until now and 2013 to sell the branches.” As a result of the bailout, British regulators have ordered Lloyds to dispose of billions of pounds’ worth of assets Go to Article from Reuters via The New York Times Â»
