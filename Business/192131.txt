China’s Sinochem Corporation will not offer a counterbid for the Potash Corporation, abandoning efforts to spoil BHP Billiton‘s $39 billion (24.35 billion pound) bid for the Canadian fertilizer maker, Reuters reported.

Another source said the idea of Sinochem forming a counterbid group, potentially involving sovereign wealth funds and industry players, had faltered in recent weeks. “I’d be surprised if the Chinese formalized their withdrawal, but there’s no … way they are doing anything. It’s been dead for five to six weeks,” one source told the news service. Go to Article from Reuters via The New York Times Â»
