Advertisement Supported by By Ben Sisario Concord Music Group, an independent music empire that caters to adult listeners, has acquired the catalog of Vee-Jay Records, a storied blues and soul label of the 1950s and ‘60s that put out records by the Staple Singers, Jimmy Reed, John Lee Hooker and Jerry Butler. The deal includes more than 5,000 recordings, including classics like Gene Chandler’s “Duke of Earl” and Betty Everett’s “The Shoop Shoop Song (It’s in His Kiss),” Concord announced on Tuesday; further terms of the deal were not disclosed. The Vee-Jay releases will join Concord’s already extensive collection of oldies catalogs like those of the labels Stax, home to Otis Redding and Isaac Hayes, and Fantasy, home to Creedence Clearwater Revival. Among the current artists signed to Concord’s labels are Paul McCartney, Paul Simon and James Taylor. Vee-Jay, founded in 1953 by Vivian Carter and James C. Bracken, a married couple who named the company after their initials, was one of the most successful black-owned labels before Motown. But it was perhaps most famous for putting out hits by the Four Seasons and releasing some of the Beatles’ first singles in the United States — like “Love Me Do” and “I Saw Her Standing There” — after Capitol, the American affiliate of the Beatles’ British label, passed on them. Vee-Jay has long since lost the rights to the Beatles and Four Seasons, however, and those records were not part of the Concord deal. Vee-Jay went bankrupt in 1966, and in 1990 its catalog was bought by a partnership controlled by Daniel Pritzker, an heir to the Pritzker hotel and industrial fortune and a well-known music enthusiast.
