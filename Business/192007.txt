LONDON — British insurer Old Mutual agreed on Thursday to sell the Skandia Insurance Company, its Nordic savings and banking business, to the Swedish insurance company Skandia Liv for Â£2.1 billion, or $3.2 billion. The announcement signals another step back from Old Mutualâs global expansion, which began in the late 1990s. Old Mutual acquired a number of asset management and banking businesses across the globe, but has since attempted to reduce the number of its operations to focus on insurance. âThe sale of Nordic to Skandia Liv represents a truly unique opportunity to create value for both Skandia Livâs policyholders and Old Mutualâs shareholders,â Julian Roberts, Old Mutualâs chief executive, said in a statement. âThe transaction will also enable us to reduce complexity within the group consistent with our stated strategy and to focus more sharply on those parts of our long-term savings business where the greatest opportunities are available.â The markets reacted positively to the news, and Old Mutualâs share price rose 10 percent in late morning trading in London. For the year, the companyâs stock is down 10.5 percent. Skandia Insurance, which operates in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, had net assets of Â£1.7 billion as of June 30, and had posted pretax profit of Â£60 million in that period, Old Mutual said in a statement. Old Mutual, based in London, expects the sale to close by the end of the first quarter of 2012.  The company also said it was looking to sell its 52 percent stake in Nedbank of South Africa. A $7.3 billion sale to HSBC fell through last year, and global market volatility has stymied Old Mutualâs renewed efforts to offload the bank. Advertisement
