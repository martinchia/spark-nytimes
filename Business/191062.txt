The troubled Texas utility Energy Future Holdings â which, as TXU, was private equityâs biggest-ever buyout â filed for bankruptcy on Tuesday, Julie Creswell and Michael J. de la Merced write in DealBook. After months of on-again, off-again talks between the company, its owners and creditors, Energy Future Holdings went into Chapter 11 protection with a plan meant to avoid months in bankruptcy court in what will be one of the biggest Chapter 11 filings in history. Energy Future will probably be split between its regulated electricity arm, Oncor, and its unregulated power-generation business. The talks had long been stymied by an array of issues, including whether such a split would create a tax bill of more than $7 billion. This is certainly not the ending the Wall Street private equity firms, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, TPG Capital and the private equity arm of Goldman Sachs, had in mind in 2007 when they acquired TXU Corporation in an audacious $45 billion deal. The firms’ investments are expected to be all but be wiped out in the bankruptcy.   PFIZERâS BID TO MOVE ABROAD Â |Â  Pfizer no longer wants to be an American citizen, David Gelles and Michael J. de la Merced write in DealBook. On Monday, Pfizer â the maker of best-selling drugs like Lipitor and Viagra and a symbol of business prowess in the United States for more than a century â proposed a $99 billion acquisition of its British rival AstraZeneca that would allow it to reincorporate in Britain. The deal would allow Pfizer to escape the corporate tax rate in the United States and âtap into a mountain of cash trapped overseas, saving it billions of dollars each year and making the company more competitive with other global drug makers,â Mr. Gelles and Mr. de la Merced write. For its part, Pfizer says that its main reason for the deal is broadening its portfolio of drugs and saving money through combined operations with AstraZeneca. Still, a deal would allow Pfizer to follow dozens of other large American companies that have already incorporated abroad through acquiring foreign companies. These types of corporate moves do not sit lightly with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who on Monday blamed the current tax code for providing an incentive for American companies to move abroad, where tax rates are lower. For companies that have already begun the process of moving abroad through these types of deals, known as inversions, the result will be hundreds of millions of dollars in annual tax savings, and an equivalent amount of money lost to the United States Treasury.  BANK OF AMERICAâS $4 BILLION MISTAKE Â |Â  Bank of America disclosed on Monday that it had made a significant accounting error in the way it calculated a crucial measure of its financial health, another bump in the road for the sprawling bank, Peter Eavis and Michael Corkery write in DealBook. The mistake, undetected for several years, led the bank to report recently that it had $4 billion more capital than it actually held. After Bank of America disclosed the error, the Federal Reserve required the bank to suspend a share buyback and a planned increase in its quarterly dividend. The reporting of the accounting error will most likely add fire to the debate over whether banks are too big to fail and too complicated to manage. The error also raises questions about the quality of Bank of Americaâs own accounting employees, who did not detect the mistake, which stemmed from Bank of Americaâs acquisition of Merrill Lynch, the Wall Street giant, during the financial crisis. The bank will now have to go back to the Fed to try and resolve the issue and regain permission to make some payouts.

FRANCE PLAYS AN AGGRESSIVE HAND Â |Â  Shortly after news leaked last week that General Electric was working on a deal to buy part of the French industrial giant Alstom, Franceâs economic minister, Arnaud Montebourg, demanded an explanation from Alstomâs chief executive. Why would Alstom, the pride of France, be negotiating to sell its energy business to the American conglomerate without first informing the government? Mr. Montebourg has since made it clear that he would rather see G.E.âs German rival, Siemens, win the bidding for Alstomâs energy business, Liz Alderman and David Jolly write in DealBook. Ms. Alderman and Mr. Jolly write: âOn a day when many European heads of state were preoccupied with economic sanctions on Russia, the French governmentâs intimate involvement in a corporate takeover battle spoke volumes about Franceâs continued efforts to shield its economy. It was only the latest in a series of efforts by the Hollande administration to protect iconic French companies as the nation struggles to regain its industrial might.â The deal-brokering came two months after Franceâs president, FranÃ§ois Hollande, sought to convince international investors that France was âopen for business.â And it raised questions about whether the government was out of step with globalization. For its part, Franceâs Socialist government said it was reacting normally. In demanding that the interests of the public be paramount over the shareholdersâ, Ms. Alderman and Mr. Jolly write, the government is upholding the tradition of dirigisme, an interventionist approach that historically has informed French economic thinking.
