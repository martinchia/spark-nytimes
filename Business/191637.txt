Generating revenue along with the buzz. There’s nothing like thinking about the history of social media to make you feel old. When my husband, Doug, and I opened our yarn shop in the spring of 2002, Mark Zuckerberg had just graduated from high school, MySpace was more than a year from being launched, and the “smartest” phone out there was the Palm. So, shortly after we opened the doors of our shop, Doug built a website to supplement our in-store sales. Back then, we lived in Truckee, Calif., a tourist town of 14,000 residents that could swell to more than 100,000 on weekends, and we had grand visions of continuing a relationship with some of these visitors after they returned home. I guess you could call what we were doing an early version of social media. I could picture it. I could imagine making those customers feel as if they were still in Truckee, shopping in our store — even if they were actually in their pajamas and in their own kitchen. (Back then, shopping in your pajamas was still a novel concept.) Our goal was to make shopping online fun, and we wanted to give them as close to an in-store experience as possible.  In the beginning, we sought to accomplish this with tenacious service: We replied to customer emails almost instantly; we called people if we suspected the colors they had ordered might not make them happy; and we shipped their orders the same day they were placed. But as time went on, we looked for more innovative ways to engage our remote customers. Today, these âinnovationsâ are pretty standard, but back then they were not. To simulate the in-store experience of “knit night” at the shop, we started sending out email newsletters once a month; to simulate the community feel of a neighborhood knitting shop, Doug added “social” functions to our website: reviews, wish lists, share buttons. And to help our customers get to know us, we added a Team Jimmy Beans page to the site. And then YouTube came along, and we realized it was perfect for us. The idea was simple: Let’s tell customers, in a video, exactly what we’d tell them if they walked into the store. From a technical perspective, it was beautiful: We were constantly adding content to our site, which gave us better rankings on Google searches. And we were spreading the word by asking the manufacturers of the products we reviewed to share these videos with their audiences! (Many of these yarn companies had pretty significant consumer followings of their own.) We had fun with it. We’d offer “be an employee for a day” specials in which customers could get the employee discount if they recorded three videos. And when people who are well known in our industry stopped by the shop, we’d ask them to do a few videos. It worked! Our organic Google rankings skyrocketed, our visibility went way up — if you search “lorna’s laces video review,” you’ll see what I mean. And we were connecting better than ever with our customers. To this day, when we attend events, customers come up to the women who work here and say “I know you! I saw you in the YouTube video about â¦â Six years later, it seems obvious to us that these efforts had something to do with the nearly 250 percent growth we experienced between 2008 and 2013. We’ve now got thousands of videos on our YouTube channel, and they have received millions of views. But that was then. And this is now. It’s a different World Wide Web today. As I explained in my last post, we are now on a quest to reexamine our business, and we’re asking ourselves if our approach to YouTube — to all of social media, for that matter — still makes sense. Are our videos still relevant? Are they still useful? What can we do better? For the last few years, we’ve kind of puttered along on autopilot. Sure, we have a Facebook account and a Twitter account and an Instagram account. We post often, and we have a lot of fun, but we’ve never really spent the time to define our goals and make sure we use the channels as best we can. As with our early success with YouTube, I believe there’s tremendous potential here. If we can figure out how, and why, to use each one of these platforms, I think we can re-energize the brand and get closer to achieving our goal of being a local yarn store online. I decided to start my review by focusing on Instagram. In my next post, Iâll tell you what I learned. Laura Zander is chief executive of Jimmy Beans Wool. You can follow the company on Twitter.
