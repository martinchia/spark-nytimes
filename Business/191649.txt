Trading was uneven, and indexes moved between small gains and losses for most of the day. A late push higher left the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index at nominal highs, but just barely. May was the best month for investors since February. The S.&P. 500 rose 2.1 percent for the month, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq rose 3.1 percent. “This market may have been choppy earlier in the year, but the trend is higher,” said Karyn Cavanaugh, a market strategist with Voya Investment Management. The Dow on Friday rose 18.43 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 16,717.17, less than two points above its previous high set on May 13. The S.&P. 500 rose 3.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,923.57, also closing at a record. The Nasdaq, however, fell 5.33 points, or 0.1 percent, to 4,242.62. On Friday, investors had two somewhat disappointing reports to interpret. The Commerce Department said consumer spending unexpectedly fell 0.1 percent in April, the first drop in that indicator in a year. Economists expect the drop to be temporary, however. Consumer spending jumped 1 percent in March. “It is obvious that after an unseasonably colder January and February, consumers came out with a vengeance in March,” Chris G. Christopher, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said in a note to clients. “So April’s poor showing on the spending front is payback for a strong March.” In a separate report, the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index fell more than analysts were expecting, dropping to 81.9 in May from 84.9 in April. Economists had expected 82.8.  Still, Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said that confidence in the first five months of this year had been at the highest level since 2007. Next week will be heavy with economic data. The May jobs report comes out June 6. Economists expect that the economy created 220,000 jobs in May and that the unemployment rate fell to 6.3 percent, according to FactSet, a financial information provider. The European Central Bank will also have its interest rate policy meeting on June 6. Lions Gate Entertainment was one of the biggest decliners Friday. The movie studio dropped $3.40, or 12 percent, to $26.13 after reporting a profit of 35 cents a share, a 70 percent drop from the year before and well below what analysts had expected. Lions Gate’s movies include the “The Hunger Games” series. The sunglasses retailer Pacific Sunwear of California dropped 52 cents, or 18 percent, to $2.42. The company warned investors that it would report a 2-cent loss this quarter versus the 2-cent profit that analysts had expected. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed at 2.48 percent. Bond yields are near their lows for the year thanks to strong demand. The price fell 2/32 to 100 7/32. “If we were in a normal bond market, these yields would signal weakness in the U.S. economy,” said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. “But I think what’s going on is more of a temporary phenomenon.” Roughly 3.2 billion shares traded hands on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
