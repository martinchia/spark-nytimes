The International Lease Finance Corporation, the aircraft leasing subsidiary of the American International Group, filed for an initial public offering on Friday, giving the insurance company a way to spin off the business and raise money to pay off its government bailout. ILFC Holdings, a newly formed holding company, said in a regulatory filing that it would own 100 percent of International Lease Finance and that A.I.G. would receive all of the proceeds from the stock offering of ILFC.  In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, ILFC gave no details of the timing of the offering or how many shares would be offered. A.I.G. would continue to own a majority stake in ILFC after the offering, according to the filing, but it would sell off its remaining holdings over the next few years. A.I.G., which received a multibillion-dollar bailout three years ago, has considered an offering or sale of the aircraft leasing business for years. The stock offering of International Lease Finance would be the latest step in A.I.G.âs effort to repay that bailout. The company still owes the Treasury Department more than $50 billion.  The company has already sold or spun off a number of major businesses, including international life insurance operations and a consumer finance unit.  In May, A.I.G. conducted its own stock offering, which raised $8.7 billion and cut the governmentâs stake in the insurer to about 77 percent. Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley are acting as the joint global coordinators of the ILFC stock offering. Advertisement
