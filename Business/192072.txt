Credit Suisse cut the pay of its chief executive, Brady W. Dougan, by 34 percent last year, to $14.1 million, after earnings fell in 2010. Mr. Dougan earned 12.8 million Swiss francs, including a salary of 2.5 million francs and 10.3 million francs in bonuses, pension benefits and other compensation, according to the Credit Suisse annual report released on Thursday. While overall compensation was down, Mr. Dougan’s salary doubled from 2009. “Consistent with the lower performance of the group in 2010 compared to 2009, the average total compensation for executive board members, excluding individuals who joined or left during 2010, was 32 percent lower,” the bank said. Profit at Credit Suisse fell to 5.1 billion francs in 2010 from 6.7 billion francs a year earlier. Credit Suisse has joined the ranks of European banks that have handed out smaller pay packages to top executives, moves that have come as regulators pressure financial institutions to set up compensation programs that reward long-term performance rather than risk-taking. The head of Deutsche Bank, Josef Ackermann, saw his total compensation in salary and bonuses fall to 6.3 million euros ($8.7 million) in 2010 from 7.5 million euros in 2009. Deutsche Bank’s net profit fell by more than half last year, to 2.3 billion euros. Oswald GrÃ¼bel, chief executive of UBS in Switzerland, decided to forgo his bonus for 2010. His salary of 3 million francs was the same as in 2009. The tempered pay package came even as UBS returned to profit, after posting a loss of 2.1 billion francs in 2009. Antonio C. Quintella, Credit Suisse’s chief executive for the Americas, was the highest paid member of the bank’s executive team. Mr. Quintella, who was promoted in July, received a total compensation of 15.6 million francs, including a cash salary of 790,000 francs. Advertisement
