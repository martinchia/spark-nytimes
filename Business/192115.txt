After months of anticipation, General Motors is finally moving ahead with its initial public offering.Â  And for the last 24 hours, the place to turn for the details has been — of all places — a Web site called RetailRoadshow.com. DealBook, like many news outlets, linked to G.M.âs presentation on Thursday. But then we started to wonder: What, exactly, is RetailRoadshow.com, anyway? It is, as its name suggests, a catalog of current roadshows that is aimed at retail investors.Â  Five years ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission put into effect new rules that required roadshows to be made available not just to institutional investors, but to individuals, too.  The day the rule took effect, RetailRoadshow.com went live, said its president, Brad Hammond. âWeâre pretty much the only game in town,â Mr. Hammond said in a telephone interview. Mr. Hammond, 56, has made a cottage industry out of making roadshows available online.Â  After working in Silicon Valley for a mainframe computer company, Mr. Hammond switched to finance, working in the institutional sales and high net-worth businesses for Morgan Stanley in the 1990s before moving to Atlanta in 1995 to work for what was then the Robinson-Humphrey Company. Robinson-Humphreyâs roadshows drew only a fraction of the attendees as those who Mr. Hammond had seen at Morgan Stanley. âThatâs when I thought, hey, maybe thereâs a better way to do this, where we could get broader distribution,â he said. Mr. Hammond turned to the Internet, founding NetRoadshow in 1997 with a green light from the S.E.C.Â  The Web site catered to institutional investors; a sibling Web site, RetailRoadshow, made its debut in 2005 when the S.E.C. changed its rules. (For a detailed discussion of the new rules, see pages 132 to 135 of this S.E.C. action. Warning: this is a big PDF file to download.) âThe whole purpose of RetailRoadshow is compliance,â Mr. Hammond said. âThe S.E.C. kind of said, âHey, we need to do this, you need to do this.âÂ  So weâre doing it.Â  Itâs not the bulk of the business.â Mr. Hammondâs company is paid by an I.P.O.âs underwriters to record and host their roadshow — either by filming on location, say, or recording audio over the telephone.Â  NetRoadshow charges around $10,000 to $20,000 for the average roadshow, which comes out of a given transactionâs marketing budget and is usually split among its underwriters. During the Internet boom, NetRoadshow itself even became the subject of a transaction.Â  The billionaire Mark Cuban‘s streaming media Web site, Broadcast.com, bought NetRoadshow from Mr. Hammond in 1999 for $50 million in stock. Only weeks later, Broadcast.com was acquired by Yahoo, making the deal even more lucrative. In 2003, Mr. Hammond bought his company back from the more consumer-oriented Yahoo. âWe were kind of a round peg in a square hole,â he said. Mr. Hammondâs company, which is based in Atlanta and New York and now has 60 employees over all, usually makes available more than 100 roadshows on its Web sites at any given point.Â  Most of them are roadshows for offerings of high-yield debt, asset-backed securities and the like, which are made available to institutional investors. The retail site is focused on initial public offerings; the G.M. roadshow was one of 13 available for viewing on Friday. On occasion, an I.P.O. attracts enough mainstream interest that Mr. Hammond finds his Web site cited in the news media. Earlier this year, for instance, the roadshow for Tesla Motors attracted some attention because of what it hinted about future models the automaker might produce. âWe get comments: People e-mail us and say, âHey, thanks, this is great — I never knew this existed,ââ Mr. Hammond said. — Thomas Kaplan Advertisement
