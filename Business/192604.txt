 Three technology stock traders have left the Boston office of Steven A. Cohenâs nearly $10 billion family office over the last week in a new round of defections at a firm that is still dealing with the fallout from a significant insider trading investigation. The three traders who resigned from Point72 Asset Management are Telis Bertsekas, Michael Valentine and Nina Hughes, said two people who were briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly. All three had worked in the relatively small Boston office of the 850-employee firm, which maintains its headquarters in Stamford, Conn. The departures of Mr. Bertsekas and Ms. Hughes are notable because the two jointly managed a portfolio of mainly technology stocks with a value of several hundred million dollars. Ms. Hughes was one of the few women portfolio managers to work for Mr. Cohen. It is not clear where three traders are going; none could be reached for comment. But one of the people briefed on the departures of Mr. Bertsekas and Ms. Hughes said they were expected to regroup at another hedge fund.  A representative for Mr. Cohen declined to comment. Mr. Cohen has said in notices to employees that his family office will remain as much of a trading force on Wall Street as his former hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors. Mr. Cohen renamed his firm just days before it pleaded guilty to insider trading charges in April and paid a $1.2 billion penalty to federal prosecutors. The firm has also paid more than $600 million to securities regulators and agreed not to manage money for outside investors. Mr. Cohen, 58, and other executives at Point72 have said they do not anticipate the firm, which once employed nearly 1,000 people and managed more than $14 billion as a hedge fund, to shrink much more from its current size. The firm decided to close its London office last year, resulting in job losses for several dozen people. And earlier this year, nearly a dozen traders and analysts left for jobs at other hedge funds. Some of the rival hedge funds that have hired people away from Mr. Cohen include BlueCrest Capital Management, Moore Capital Management, Balyasny Asset Management and Highbridge Capital Management. In a bid to stem the departure of top portfolio managers, Mr. Cohen began this spring to press those who remain at the firm to sign contracts that would bind them to their jobs until the end of 2016, people briefed on the matter said. The firm also threatened to sue some traders who left before their existing contracts were up and required them to delay the start dates of their new jobs as a condition for their early release, these people said. The moves seemed to slow the departures until now. It’s not clear how many people remain in the firm’s Boston office after the latest departures. Advertisement
