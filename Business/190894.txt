Progress Seen in Advancing a Final Volcker Rule Â |Â  A major new rule that has drawn the ire of Wall Street is on track for completion sooner than some bankers had expected, dashing the hopes of financial industry lobbyists, who have pressed for a delay. Regulators are making significant progress on a final draft of the regulation, the Volcker Rule, and some officials expected to complete it by September and possibly as early as this summer, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioned that regulators had not set a firm date for completing the rule. The Volcker Rule aims to rein in risky trading on Wall Street. Named for Paul A. Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve, it would bar banks from placing bets with their own money, a practice known as proprietary trading. On Wednesday, the chief executives of six large banks voiced concerns about new regulations like the Volcker Rule at a meeting with Daniel K. Tarullo, a Federal Reserve governor. The gathering, held at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in Lower Manhattan, was arranged by Mr. Tarullo and JPMorgan Chaseâs chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who has criticized elements of the Volcker Rule.
