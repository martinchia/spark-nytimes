The discussion of taxes usually waits until sometime close to the filing deadline, April 15. But this year, the presidential candidates’ release of their past returns has lead to a much deeper look much earlier. One thing that has come out of all the talk of taxes, Paul Sullivan writes in this week’s Wealth Matters column, is that both Republicans and Democrats have made financial decisions that may be perfectly legal but don’t look good under the spotlight. That point has been underlined this year as the candidates’ wealth contrasts with the economic struggles of many voters. The advice that experts on both sides of the aisle shared on what potential candidates (or cabinet members) should be doing now to avoid problems later could apply to all business people. It can be summarized this way: Pay your taxes, and don’t try to be too creative with them. And live your financial life with integrity. Do you have further advice, as tax season begins?
