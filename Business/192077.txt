Putting together a merger as complicated as the deal between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche BÃ¶rse — which are forming the world’s largest financial market for stocks and derivatives — is no easy task. Not surprisingly, both companies brought in a cadre of advisers to help put the deal together. NYSE Euronext was advised by Perella Weinberg Partners and BNP Paribas and the law firms Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz; Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy; and the Dutch firm Stibbe. Deutsche BÃ¶rse was advised by Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase and the law firm Linklaters. The NYSE Euronext assignment is a big achievement for Perella Weinberg, the boutique co-founded in 2006 by Joseph R. Perella. (Several bankers at much larger institutions have expressed surprise at how the firm leapfrogged over them to get the assignment.) The firm has snagged advisory roles in several major deals since its founding, including Wachovia’s sale in 2008 to Wells Fargo and the Pepsi Bottling Group’s takeover by Pepsico in 2009. But several of its most recent major deals — like the leveraged buyouts of J.Crew and Del Monte, the sale of Massey Energy to Alpha Natural Resources and Qwest Communications‘ merger with CenturyTel — have been advising company boards, a less-lucrative role. Deutsche BÃ¶rse’s advisory team poses fewer surprises, with Deutsche Bank serving as a natural lead adviser alongside JPMorgan. Yet the joint news release on Tuesday also mentioned other firms that provided “further financial advice.” In this case, Credit Suisse and SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale were additional advisers to Detusche BÃ¶rse, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley worked for NYSE Euronext, people briefed on the matter told DealBook. (Morgan Stanley already has a piece of two other exchange mergers. It is advising the London Stock Exchange in its deal with the Toronto Stock Exchange, and Singapore’s SGX in its acquisition of Australia’s ASX.) Why bring in the additional help? It’s possible that NYSE Euronext was doing a favor to Goldman and Morgan, two of its most important customers. Beyond the advisory fees, the two firms would also receive credit in the all-important league tables. But it’s also possible that NYSE Euronext may want the two firms around if a potential rival bidder, like the CME Group, emerges. Other banks have been studying ways to get a piece of the action, people briefed on the matter have told DealBook, though it’s unclear whether anything concrete will take shape. Advertisement
