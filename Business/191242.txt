ICAHNâS FIGHT OVER DELL HEADS TO COURT  |  Carl C. Icahn is heading to the Delaware Court of Chancery in his effort to stop a buyout of Dell by its founder. On Friday, the court is scheduled to consider whether to expedite Mr. Icahnâs lawsuit against the board of the computer maker. (The hearing had originally been planned for earlier this week.) Mr. Icahn is seeking to have the court schedule a hearing to consider his claims that two meetings planned for Dell â to vote on the buyout and to elect directors â should be held on the same date. Steven M. Davidoff wrote in DealBook about the case this month. On Thursday, Dell reported earnings that highlighted its continuing challenges. The company reported that net income in its fiscal second quarter fell 72 percent to $204 million from $732 million a year earlier. Revenue was $14.5 billion, virtually flat from a year earlier but better than the $14.18 billion that analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had expected. The adjusted earnings per share of 25 cents were a penny better than analystsâ expectations. The results might motivate shareholders to support the effort by Michael S. Dell and Silver Lake to take the company private.  âThe PC market continues to trend below expectations. It will play into Michael Dellâs plea to take the company private,â Jayson Noland, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Company, told Bloomberg News. 

A DEAL FOR THE DEVILS  |  Two private equity investors â Joshua Harris, a co-founder of Apollo Global Management, and David S. Blitzer, the head of tactical opportunities for the Blackstone Group â agreed on Thursday to buy the New Jersey Devils hockey team for about $320 million. Both men are members of the group that bought the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, with Mr. Harris serving as principal owner, DealBookâs Michael J. de la Merced writes.
âThough neither man is a native of Philadelphia, both graduated from the University of Pennsylvaniaâs Wharton School and have long rooted for the cityâs teams. But both men are part of the latest generation of financiers to buy pro sports organizations as trophy properties,â Mr. de la Merced writes. âPart of the selling point for bringing in private equity owners â other than their big bank accounts â is their expertise in turning around troubled enterprises.â




ON THE AGENDA  |  Investors in SAC Capital Advisors have a deadline tonight to ask for their money back. Data on housing starts in July is out at 8:30 a.m. The Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for August is out at 9:55 a.m. Matthew Maloney, the chief executive of GrubHub Seamless, is on Bloomberg TV at 8:45 a.m. 




INDIA SEEKS TO OVERHAUL CORPORATE OVERSIGHT  |  âIn the wake of global scandals involving kickbacks and accounting fraud, one unlikely country, India, is aiming to set a tone in overhauling its corporate oversight laws,â Jen Swanson reports in DealBook. âThis month, the nationâs upper house of Parliament passed the Companies Bill, 2012, sweeping legislation meant to overhaul auditing, impose stiffer penalties for fraud and create more government oversight of businesses.â
âThe lower house had passed the bill last year. Once Indiaâs president, Pranab Mukherjee, signs it into law, it will replace Indiaâs 57-year-old corporate legislation that critics say had failed to keep up with changes in business practices.â
