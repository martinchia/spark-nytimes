The Japanese investment bank Nomura is accelerating its expansion in the Americas.  On Monday, the bank said it had hired 13 managing directors and two executive directors for investment banking roles. Last year, it hired about a dozen bankers. Nomura’s global chief of investment banking, Kentaro Okuda, told Bloomberg News late last year that the bank would ramp up its hiring of American bankers. “Weâve entered the phase where we can think about how to make deals and obtain clients in the Americas,â Mr. Okuda said in the interview with Bloomberg. âThere are tons of deals there.â The latest Nomura executives are:  “We are growing the business strategically and focusing on the areas where we can provide meaningful solutions to our clients,â said James DeNaut, the head Americas investment banking. Nomura is currently ranked No. 11 in global equity underwriting and 12th in global initial public offerings, according to Thomson Reuters data. In merger advising in the United States, however, the bank does not crack the top 25 in the league tables year to date. Advertisement
