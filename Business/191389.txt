Berkshire Hathaway announced on Monday that Ted Weschler would join the company as its second investment manager.  He  joins Todd Combs, who was hired last October.  The hiring is part of an effort by Berkshire to prepare for life after Warren E. Buffett. Mr. Buffett, who turned 81 last month, has said that his roles of chairman, chief executive and chief investment officer will be split among at least three people upon his death or departure from the company. And Berkshire has said that as many as three managers may have responsibility for the company’s equity and debt portfolio.   Mr. Weschler, 50, is the founder and managing partner of Peninsula Capital Advisers, a private investment management firm in Charlottesville, Va., whose funds include Peninsula Investment Advisers and Peninsula Capital Appreciation.   The firm in the past has taken stakes in WSFS Financial, Wilsons the Leather Experts and the merged US Airways-America West. As of June 30, it had  holdings in DirectTV, W.R. Grace & Company, Valassis Communications and DaVita, among others, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He has told his limited partners that he will be winding up Peninsula to join Berkshire early next year, Berkshire said in its statement. In a fascinating sidelight, Carol J. Loomis of Fortune reports that Mr. Weschler was the winning bidder for Mr. Buffett’s annual charity lunch for the last two years. Mr. Weschler spent a total of $5.25 million to get to know his now soon-to-be boss. In its statement, Berkshire said: “After Mr. Buffett no longer serves as C.E.O., Todd and Ted — possibly aided by one additional manager — will have responsibility for the entire equity and debt portfolio of Berkshire, subject to overall direction by the then-C.E.O. and board of directors. With Todd and Ted on board, Berkshire is well-positioned for successor investment management at the time Mr. Buffett is no longer C.E.O.” Mr. Combs, 40, had run Castle Point Capital Management in Greenwich, Conn., for five years before joining Berkshire.
