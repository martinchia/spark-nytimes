Advertisement Supported by By Elizabeth A. Harris Walmart announced two high-level changes to its e-commerce team on Monday, as it pushes to ramp up its online business and compete with its archrival Amazon.  Walmart said Monday that Joel Anderson, who has been president of Walmart.com in the United States for the last three years, was resigning from the company to take a job elsewhere. A Walmart spokesman declined to name Mr. Anderson’s new employer, or to say whether it was another retailer, adding that an announcement would be made by that company in the next few days.  The other change was the promotion of Fernando Madeira, who has been the president of Walmart’s Latin American e-commerce division. His new responsibilities will include leading Walmart.com’s domestic and Latin America teams, as well as other “growth areas,” the company said. Though these are some of the more visible changes to be made at Walmart’s e-commerce division, they are far from the only shifts in personnel. Dan Toporek, a company spokesman, said Walmart.com had hired about 1,000 employees in the last 18 months in Silicon Valley alone. Another 600 people were hired in Brazil in that time, he said.  The company has also been beefing up its infrastructure, announcing three new e-commerce centers in just the past few months — one in Texas, one in Pennsylvania and one in Indiana.  At its annual shareholder meeting last week, Walmart’s new chief executive, Doug McMillon, spoke extensively about offering more convenient, and often more technologically advanced ways of getting goods to their customers, pinpointing that as one of the keys to the company’s future health.  “It is important that we all understand the shift that has happened in technology and retail, what it means for us, and what we’re doing to win,” Mr. McMillon said.
