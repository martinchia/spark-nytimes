LONDON â The Serious Fraud Office of Britain has reopened a criminal investigation into the collapse of Weavering Capital, one of Londonâs oldest hedge funds. The decision marks a turnaround for the British authorities, who dropped their investigation into the hedge fund last September because they believed there was not enough evidence to pursue a conviction. In May, however, Magnus Peterson, the founder of Weavering Capital, was found guilty by a British judge of defrauding investors. Mr. Peterson and three of the firmâs other directors were ordered to pay $450 million in damages. In response to the legal ruling against the hedge fundâs top executives, the Serious Fraud Office said it had reopened a criminal investigation into Weavering Capital. The news comes days after British officials said they might pursue criminal prosecutions against traders implicated in the rate manipulation scandal at Barclays. The British bank agreed to a $450 million settlement with American and British authorities, though individuals involved in the case might still face civil or criminal charges. The reopening of the case against Weavering Capital marks a statement of intent by David Green, the Serious Fraud Officeâs new director. Mr. Green took over the British government department in April, and has announced a number of new investigations into potential fraud. Weavering Capital, which had more than $600 million of funds under management, collapsed in 2009 after it was discovered that a multimillion-dollar derivatives trade in the firmâs main fund was connected to an offshore company controlled by Mr. Peterson.
