The Treasury Department’s long-awaited report on the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac recommends that the Obama administration “wind down” the government-controlled mortgage finance companies. âWe are going to start the process of reform now, but we are going to do it responsibly and carefully so that we support the recovery and the process of repair of the housing market,â Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said in a statement.  Fannie and Freddie were public companies that operated with a congressional mandate to fuel home ownership. The companies purchase home loans from lenders, which can then use the money to offer new loans to consumers.  But to compete with Wall Street, Fannie and Freddie lowered its standards during the mortgage bubble, ultimately taking onto its books hundreds of millions of dollars in risky mortgages. After the mortgage market collapsed in 2008, the government rescued Fannie and Freddie from the brink of collapse, pumping more than $100 billion and counting into the companies.  The Treasury Department’s report outlines several possible solutions to stop the bleeding.  The report suggests, for instance, that Fannie and Freddie buy loans with smaller outstanding balances, thereby reducing the risk. The report also recommends phasing in a requirement that Fannie and Freddie borrowers put down more money on their mortgage, at least 10 percent. Finally, the government wants Fannie and Freddie to wind down their own mortgage investment portfolios.  Sewell Chan and Binyamin Appelbaum of The New York Times report:  In presenting the three options, the administration excluded the possibility of completely eliminating government support for the housing market â as some free-market conservative Republicans have proposed. But officials said the governmentâs role would almost certainly be reduced from what it was before the financial crisis began in 2008.
