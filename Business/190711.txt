What’s wrong with this site? In my most recent post, we were challenged to simplify a fairly complex online value proposition. Bid4Spots allows advertising clients to “reverse bid” for radio airtime. When the site was introduced, the company believed that customers would fully commit to the auction online without human interaction. Over time, however, it realized that it was going to be necessary to have Bid4Spots representatives walk clients through the process. The company’s founder and chief executive, Dave Newmark, believes the model works, but he has yet to figure out the ideal way to communicate the site’s benefits. Some readers of the post had questions for Mr. Newmark about the company’s business model. I caught up with him to get his responses. One reader was under the impression that eBay and Google had entered and exited this market a few years ago â and wondered about their experiences. “While he has a clever concept,” this commenter wrote, “perhaps the market for reverse-auction, remnant, radio time isn’t that great.”  “Other companies had previously tried and failed to create a forward online auction model,” Mr. Newmark said. “They failed because they were using the supply and demand model, thinking advertisers would be willing to bid up on the limited supply of advertising inventory that would be sold, driving up the advertising rates. This did not happen. I created Bid4Spotsâ reverse-auction model, knowing that many stations wanted to close their books on the airtime they didnât sell and were happy to bid down their rates in order to sell the time rather than taking a total loss.” Another commenter suggested that the website might be just fine but that the business model with its reverse auction of remnant inventory over the Internet might just have too many moving parts — “even for seasoned radio advertisers.” “The reverse-auctionÂ concept can be a little intimidating, which is why we work with potential advertisers from the outset to create a budget, review the target audience for their businessâs product and/or service and guide them through the reverse-auction process,” Mr. Newmark said. “There is $17 billion of unsold radio advertising inventory on the table and many businesses understand this represents a great opportunity for them to find a good deal, which could be up to 90 percent off of the standard ad rates. To date we have served more than 10,000 advertisers.” One of my colleagues at AbesMarket.com read the post and decided to call Bid4Spots to test the service. She found the site informative but felt compelled to speak to someone to fully understand their offering and value. Her brief experience has been positive and confirms my belief that businesses with complex value propositions should focus on execution. If they do, word of mouth will be their most successful customer-acquisition channel â the best outcome any company can hope for.
