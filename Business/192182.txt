The American International Group sold its holdings in MetLife late Wednesday, fetching about $9.6 billion from the stock offerings to help pay back its government bailout.  The insurer sold 146.8 million MetLife common shares for about $6.3 billion, the Treasury Department said in a statement. The shares were sold at $43.25, slightly below MetLife’s closing price of $43.41 on Wednesday.  A.I.G. also sold equity units with a face value of $3 billion for $3.3 billion.  The proceeds from the stock sale will go toward paying down some of the Treasury’s $18.2 billion in preferred equity holding in the company.  A.I.G., MetLife and Treasury announced Tuesday that they had agreed to hold the stock sales sooner than expected to seize upon the rise in MetLife’s share price in recent weeks.  “This is the next chapter in A.I.G.âs remarkable turnaround,â Tim Massad, Treasury’s acting assistant secretary for financial stability, said in a statement. âWe are optimistic about the prospects that taxpayers will recover every dollar invested in A.I.G. — something that many thought would be impossible when these investments were first made.â Advertisement
