Airbnb has closed a new round of financing from a group led by TPG Growth that values the home-sharing company at about $10 billion, people briefed on the matter said on Friday. The group, which invested $475 million in the company, also included Dragoneer Investment Group, T. Rowe Price and an existing investor, Sequoia Capital. With the investment, Airbnb will reach the upper echelons of Silicon Valley start-up valuations. Other members of the 11-digit club include WhatsApp, which Facebook bought in February for more than $16 billion, and Dropbox, which investors valued at roughly $10 billion last year. At the value assigned by the investment, Airbnb — a website and app where homeowners and apartment dwellers rent their homes, spare rooms or couches to travelers — would be worth more than some established hotel chains like Wyndham Worldwide or Hyatt.
