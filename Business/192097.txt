It is very likely that we are heading into the endgame in Novartisâs attempt to acquire the remaining 23 percent of the eye care company Alcon that Novartis, the big Swiss drug maker, does not already own. The tea leaves support such a conclusion. First, the Swiss franc has appreciated measurably against the American dollar since May, making Novartis’s offer more valuable.  Alconâs shares are priced in dollars, but Novartis is offering to exchange its shares, which are priced in Swiss francs.  Novartis is offering 2.8 Novartis shares per Alcon share.  Steven M.

He is the author of “Gods at War: Shotgun Takeovers, Government by Deal and the Private Equity Implosion,” which explores modern-day deals and deal-making. Alconâs shares have risen from their 52-week low of $134.44 a share in May to around $167.50 on Tuesday afternoon. This gain is almost solely a result of the rise of the Swiss franc.  Novartis’s shares are now showing modest change from their price in January, when the company moved to acquire control of Alcon from NestlÃ©. But the rise in the Swiss franc since May has added approximately $11 to $12 a share to the Novartis offer, which is now valued at about $164 a share after being initially priced at approximately $153 a share. The Novartis offer is now only $16 a share away from the $180-a-share price that Novartis paid NestlÃ© in August to increase its stake to 77 percent of Alcon.  More importantly, Alcon is trading only about $3.50 a share above the current value of the Novartis offer, and Alconâs 52-week high is only about $6 above the offer.  These are prices at which Novartis could presumably clear the market. Second, on Sept. 30 Alcon amended its organization regulations.  Only one change was made: the word NestlÃ© was replaced by the word Novartis.  This one change had a significant effect.  Under the organizational regulations, this revision means that Novartis is now explicitly deemed a âmajority shareholderâ thereunder.  The amendment means that a squeeze-out merger of Alcon minority shareholders now requires the explicit approval of Alconâs independent director committee.  Before, because of a drafting ambiguity, it was unclear whether this was the case (a point I outlined in a post back in January). The change is significant because Novartis was required to consent to this amendment, something the company appears to have done.  The name switch is a matter of good housekeeping.  To operate Alcon appropriately, the regulations dictate that the majority shareholder have certain rights and obligations, something this change clarifies by ensuring that Novartis has assumed them. Novartisâs consent to the change may also be an acknowledgment that the ambiguity in the regulations was overstated and that it did not think that it could sustain a court challenge. But the change may also mean that Novartis is now comfortable with where the price is and the requirement to obtain special committee approval to squeeze out minority shareholders. Whatever the reason though, Novartis now explicitly needs the approval of the special committee. Finally, showing that Alcon is moving forward and Novartis and the independent director committee are working together, the independent committee consented Monday to the appointment of a Novartis designee to be the new chairman of Alcon. This last point has no great meaning other than a faint sign of cooperation. But the special committee has no desire to serve forever in this role and has stated all along it prefers a negotiated position.  Still, the independent committee issued another statement on Sept. 30 asserting that it would stand up to Novartis, a stance that is a bit odd, given the amendment of the organizational regulations that day. Meanwhile, Novartis has taken a hard line from the get-go, contending that it could go around the organizational regulations and the Swiss Code on the matter.  Whether or not Novartisâs stance worked, Novartis had an able assist from the currency gods.  If Novartis is intent on doing a deal, the time appears to be right. Updated: 
A reader points out that I may be reading too much into the change to the organization regulations. The reason is evidenced by a filing thatÂ Novartis made the same day the organization regulations were amended. In that filing Novartis trumpets its own legal opinion delivered by a Swiss law professor which confirms Novartis’ ability to complete the transaction without approval of the independent directors. The legal opinion asserts that the requirement in the organizational regulations for such approval is invalid under Swiss law. The Novartis disclosure also explains the similarly fiery press release of the independent committee also issued that day. In that press release, the committee again asserted its right to approve any transaction. I agree with the reader’s conclusion in light of this Novartis document. Still, while the posturing continues, the pricing appears to be fortuitous for Novartis to arrange a deal.  I also believe that the pricing is too close for Novartis to take the litigation risk here, even with its own expert to counter-act the committee’s own legal expert. If it did want to take that risk it already would have arranged a merger. There is, after all, a business to be run. — Steven M. Davidoff Go to the Deal Professor from DealBook Â» Advertisement
