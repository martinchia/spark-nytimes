Paul Sullivan, in his Wealth Matters column this week, discusses the issues raised when wealthy families bring their children into the family foundation. For one, the next generation may favor different types of charities than their parents. And then, there are the families that have trouble getting along. The advice from those who work with family foundations to resolve disagreements is to bring in outside experts. While Paul writes about issues that pertain to the wealthy, middle-class families also deal with succession and resolving differences, whether it is a family business or just something one generation hopes to pass on. But many middle-class families can’t afford to hire outside experts to come in and resolve their problems. To those of you out there who have had to deal with passing on a family business or something else of worth, tell us how you’ve managed to do it successfully. Or, if you had to do it over again, what would you have done differently.
