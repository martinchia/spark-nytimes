ArcelorMittal and Nunavut Iron Ore said on Thursday that they had acquired an additional 6.2 million shares of the Baffinland Iron Mines Corporation, moving closer to taking control of the company. The latest increase brings their joint stake in Baffinland to 64 percent on a diluted basis, which takes into account the company’s warrants. The aim of ArcelorMittal and Nunavut is to bring their total stake to 66.66 percent on a fully diluted basis by Friday, when their offer of 1.50 Canadian dollars a share, or about $597 million, expires.  They still have 2.66 percent to go, and in the event that they do not reach their goal the companies have said they would proceed to a mandatory acquisition of the remaining shares. ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel maker, decided last month to team up with Nunavut to acquire Baffinland and its rich iron ore deposit in the Canadian Arctic. Nunavut is backed by the Energy and Minerals Group, a private equity fund based in Texas. Under the current agreement, Nunavut will control 30 percent of the company, and Arcelor 70 percent.
