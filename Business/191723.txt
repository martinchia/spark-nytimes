What would you do with this business? A case study we just published describes a crisis faced by Lundberg Family Farms, a fourth-generation farm in Richvale, Calif., that grows and sells rice and rice products. Founded in 1937 by Albert Lundberg, who came to California from Nebraska to escape the Dust Bowl, the company now has 225 employees and grows rice â 70 percent of which is organic — on a total of 17,000 acres. Its annual revenue exceeds $50 million. In February, a Dartmouth study found inorganic arsenicÂ â a carcinogen â in brown rice syrup. In September, Consumer Reports released the results of independent lab tests that found inorganic arsenic in a variety of rice and rice products. It left the rice industry reeling and Lundberg Family Farmsâ customers in a panic. The company was inundated with calls and e-mails from consumers wanting to know where the arsenic was coming from and whether eating rice could harm them. Neither the Lundbergs nor the government had answers. No standards have been set for safe levels of inorganic arsenic in food.  The owners have immersed themselves in research to try to determine the source of the arsenic in their rice and what they can do to lower its levels. They have engaged a toxicologist to help them, and they have been sharing what they learn with consumers, largely through the companyâs Web site. The overarching message they have tried to convey is that the Lundbergs care deeply and are working to mitigate the problem. âWe havenât even guessed at what we could lose,â said Tim Schultz, a third-generation Lundberg who helps run the farm. âWeâve decided not to focus on it.â Below you can read what other business owners — all of whom have faced crises — think Lundberg Family Farms should do. Please read the article and use the comments section to offer your thoughts. Next week, we will follow up with an update about what the Lundbergs have been doing and how it has worked out. Jeff Caponigro, president of Caponigro Public Relations, in Southfield, Mich., and author of âThe Crisis Counselor: A Step by Step Guide to Managing a Business Crisisâ: âThis needs to be put into perspective for customers. They should get several independent toxicologists to give some guidelines to help customers figure out at what point arsenic in food becomes dangerous — things like, for someone to get a mild stomach ache, they have to ingest this much arsenic but to cause death, you would need to consume this much arsenic. They should also stress that as a consumer, you are much better served eating rice from a company like Lundberg, which farms organically, than one that uses pesticides. The whole idea is to alleviate customer concerns.â Jacqueline Linder, founder and chief executive of LunchBots in Los Altos, Calif., who handled the 2009 fallout from a product defect affecting 10,000 of her stainless steel food containers: âAll this research, testing and data is great, but people really want to know one thing: âCan I feed this to my kids? And should I eat it once a week? What if I eat it five times a week?â You have to answer peopleâs primary question â is this safe? They should give safety advice up front, like telling consumers to rinse the rice first. This is a company that already adheres to a higher standard of quality because they grow organic rice and believe in healthy farming. This is an opportunity for them to build on that and put procedures in place for testing quality and safety, and then make sure itâs clear to consumers they are doing that.â Patrick Muldoon, chief executive of Forward Foods, which is based in Minden, Nev., and whose best-selling product, the Detour Protein Bar, was affected — after a salmonella outbreak in 2009 — by a recall of foods that used product from Peanut Corporation of America: âThey should ask themselves if their actions will lead to reducing the inorganic arsenic level below Prop 65 levels, which sets standards for consumer toxicity and carcinogen exposure levels in California. They are a California business and thatâs the toughest standard. If they canât get at or below it, they have to change their packaging, which is how they warn consumers and protect consumers. That is the most important thing. One lesson for us was that as owners you have to step back and look at public safety first. Itâs a terrible road you go down if you trivialize the data or the risk. Their plot of land has to be understood, which means looking at every single thing that touches the land, and getting the best experts to eliminate every cause of the arsenic. They need to get to the facts, rather than worrying about the message.â Scott Mitchell, chief executive of Organic Salon Systems in Palm Harbor, Fla., which makes organic skin and hair care products and which recently endured selling shampoo in defective bottles that snapped in half when squeezed: âThe Web site is going to draw people who are already looking for information, but they should be more proactive in communicating, whether itâs through e-mail campaigns or advertising in places where their customers would be. They also need to communicate exactly what they are doing to learn more about the problem and what they are doing internally to address it. The more specific they can be, the more successful they will be. It may seem counter-intuitive to advertise youâre having a problem, but in the long run transparency without communication means nothing.â You're the Boss offers an insider's perspective on small-business ownership.
