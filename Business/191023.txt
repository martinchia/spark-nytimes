Shareholders who had protested Hillshire Brands’ takeover of Pinnacle Foods will most likely be heartened by the packaged foods company’s decision to talk to its two unsolicited suitors. Still, ending the $5.3 billion Pinnacle deal isn’t as simple as just walking away. Hillshire confirmed on Tuesday that it planned to begin talks with both Pilgrim’s Pride and Tyson Foods after each company had offered more than $6 billion. (The move came after Pilgrim’s Pride raised its bid to $55 a share from $45; Tyson bid $50 a share last week.) Shareholders in Hillshire, which makes Ball Park hot dogs and its namesake lunch meats, have been thrilled by the emergence of takeover bids for their company. Pinnacle, with its Vlasic pickles and Birds Eye frozen vegetables, seemed like a poor choice for an acquisition target, adding older brands that would weigh the food maker down. But as Hillshire noted in its news release on Tuesday, it can’t unilaterally kill its earlier deal: Hillshire Brands does not have the right to terminate the Pinnacle Foods merger agreement on the basis of either of these proposals or enter into an alternative acquisition agreement with either of these parties prior to termination. That doesn’t mean shareholders should lose hope, however. What both Pilgrim’s Pride and Tyson â and their lawyers at Cravath, Swaine & Moore and Davis Polk & Wardwell, respectively â noticed is section 5.4 in the Pinnacle merger agreement, which gives would-be buyers a way to break the earlier deal. While Hillshire can’t seek out alternative bids, its board can talk to suitors. The key is this: If the board determines that a takeover bid would be in the best interests of shareholders, it can then recommend that investors vote against the Pinnacle deal. Shareholders then would presumably reject that transaction, freeing Hillshire to complete whichever takeover bid its board has accepted. That’s the legal construct outlined in the merger agreement, anyway. It’s possible that Hillshire and Pinnacle could reach an agreement to terminate the deal, since the Hillshire’s investors have already shown that they favor selling the company and would reject the earlier transaction. In any case, Pinnacle would be paid $163 million as a breakup fee. Shares of Hillshire are up 8.4 percent in premarket trading, at $58.10, showing shareholders are confident that they will end up with a takeover bid instead of being saddled with a deal they don’t favor. Andrew Ross Sorkin reports that Pilgrimâs Pride offered to pay $6.4 billion in cash for Hillshire Brands, hoping to derail the sausage makerâs planned acquisition of a packaged foods company.
