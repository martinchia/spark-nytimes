Royal Bank of Scotland said on Tuesday that it had agreed to sell the Priory Group, a British chain of rehabilitation and health care centers, to the private equity group Advent International in a deal that values Priory at Â£925 million ($1.47 billion). “After the settlement of outstanding debt, R.B.S. expects to receive gross equity proceeds of up to Â£133 million in cash from the sale of its minority equity stake in the Priory Group,” the bank said in its statement to the London Stock Exchange. The sale is expected to close this quarter. In 2005, the private equity firm Doughty Hanson sold Priory to ABN Amro, which iR.B.S. bought in 2007, a disastrous deal that led to the bankâs government rescue and effective nationalization. That precrisis expansion stands in stark contrast to R.B.S.âs gradual divestment of assets, including a $6.1 billion deal with Mitsubishi UFJ announced in November. Selling Priory is the most recent step in R.B.S.âs attempt to pay down that rescue, a strategy announced about two years ago. At that time the government owned 68 percent of the bank; by spring 2010 that stake had reached 83 percent. Priory runs dozens of mental health and addiction treatment clinics in Britain, with more than 75 percent of its financing coming from the public sector. Advertisement
