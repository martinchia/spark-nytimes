AT&T agreed on Sunday to buy the satellite television operator DirecTV for $48.5 billion in a bid to âtilt the balance of power with media companies as the market for broadband Internet and video shifts,â Michael J. de la Merced and David Gelles write in DealBook. With the acquisition, AT&T becomes the latest telecommunications giant seeking to establish an even greater reach. By acquiring the countryâs biggest satellite television operator, AT&T would hold more sway when negotiating with media companies as it increasingly focuses on video offerings. Through the deal, AT&T would become the countryâs second-biggest pay TV provider, behind only Comcast, which agreed in February to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion. The acquisition would bring to AT&T DirecTVâs existing content. It would also help get AT&T into new markets like video and data services inside airplanes. DirecTV would also bolster AT&Tâs financial resources as it continues to invest in wireless-broadband capabilities. Under the agreementâs terms, AT&T will pay $95 a share in stock and cash, roughly 10 percent above DirecTVâs closing stock price on Friday and about 30 percent higher than where its shares were trading before word of a potential transaction began to emerge. Including the assumption of DirecTVâs debt, the deal is valued at about $67.1 billion. The merger is likely to face scrutiny from government regulators, who have expressed rising concern that the nationâs television and Internet services are increasingly controlled by just a few corporate giants, Mr. de la Merced and Mr. Gelles write.   ASTRAZENECA REJECTS PFIZERâS âFINALâ OFFER Â |Â  The British drug maker AstraZeneca on Monday rejected Pfizerâs latest â and, according to the American pharmaceutical giant, its âfinalâ â takeover bid, again rebuffing the offer as too low, Chad Bray writes in DealBook. The latest offer, made Sunday evening, was worth about $119 billion. On Monday, AstraZeneca said the latest bid âundervalues the company and its attractive prospects.â AstraZenecaâs shares fell 10.7 percent, to 43.03 pounds, in trading in London on Monday morning. The latest rejection may spell the end of Pfizerâs pursuit of a merger, which began last year. The company has said it will not make a hostile bid for AstraZeneca. Sundayâs offer represented a 45 percent premium over AstraZenecaâs share price before news of Pfizerâs interest became public and came after a previous offer by Pfizer on Friday. The latest proposal would have given AstraZeneca shareholders 1.747 shares of the combined company and Â£24.76 in cash for each of their shares. The offer valued each share of AstraZeneca at about Â£55, or roughly $92.50. Pfizerâs bid to acquire AstraZeneca has set off debates on both side of the Atlantic. In the United States, the focus has been on the companyâs attempt to use the deal as a means to reincorporate overseas. In Britain, lawmakers have expressed concerns about the potential loss of jobs in the event of a Pfizer takeover.  GOOGLE MAY ACQUIRE TWITCH Â |Â  Google is said to be considering a possible acquisition of Twitch, a popular live-streaming video game service, Variety reported on Sunday. For Google, the deal, said to be worth more than $1 billion, would potentially bolster its YouTube video service, which has its own live-streaming game service. Googleâs talks with Twitch are at an early stage and the deal is not imminent, according to The Wall Street Journal. Twitch, founded in 2011, said in February that it had more than 45 million monthly unique visitors, including one million people who create and stream video content on the site.

DEUTSCHE BANK RAISING NEW CAPITAL Â |Â  Responding to regulatory pressure to reduce risk, Deutsche Bank said on Sunday that it would raise roughly $11 billion in fresh capital from existing shareholders and the royal family of Qatar, Jack Ewing writes in DealBook. The bank will raise most of the new capital in a rights issue likely to begin on June 24. After the capital increase, Deutsche Bankâs common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of a bankâs ability to absorb losses, will rise to 11.8 percent from the 9.5 percent at the end of March. The measures will help calm criticism that Deutsche Bank, which has the biggest investment banking operation among European banks, presents a risk to the financial system because it does not have enough capital to absorb potential losses, Mr. Ewing writes. But the capital increase may be less welcome among shareholders, as the additional 360 million shares will dilute the value of the holdings of existing Deutsche Bank stock. The additional capital could also take a toll on earnings.
