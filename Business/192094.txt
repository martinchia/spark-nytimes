A group of private companies missed a deadline Thursday to provide a $750 million down payment to purchase Nigeria’s ailing state-run telephone company, the latest setback in efforts to privatize the firm, The Associated Press reported. The New Generation Telecommunications Consortium requested another 30 days to put up the deposit on its $2.5 billion bid for Nigerian Telecommunications, known locally as Nitel, said Usman Gumi, managing director of local company and consortium member GiCell. A spokesman for Nigeria’s Bureau of Public Enterprises, the presidential task force set up to privatize state industries, could not be reached for comment Thursday night. The proposed sale to the consortium, which Nigerian federal officials say includes China’s Unicom, Dubai’s Minerva and local company GiCell, has faced scrutiny. The $2.5 billion bid by the consortium appears grossly overpriced compared with the next highest bid of about $956 million by Omen International. Federal authorities examined the deal for about eight months before allowing it to move forward. However, it put stringent terms on the deal, requiring the down payment in 10 days and the remaining $1.75 billion within 60 days after that.
