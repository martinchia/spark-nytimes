With rates on savings accounts dwindling, you might be tempted to stash a little cash at home. While acknowledging that this is, of course, a very bad idea for all sorts of reasons (risk of theft and absentmindedness, for starters), The Consumerist recently took a (tongue-in-cheek) look at the best and worst places to stash a little emergency money in your house. If you don’t feel like springing for a safe, that is. The worst place, no surprise, is that old clichÃ© of under your mattress; too obvious. The toilet tank also gets the thumbs down because it’s vulnerable to getting things soggy and also too well known from gangster movies. So what locations get the top rating? How about a fake electrical outlet? Cut a hole in your wall, fill it with money and cover it up with an electrical plate. A hole in your yard. Be sure to use a box that protects it from moisture and bugs. And, of course, remember where you buried it. (Doh!) With personal hygiene items. Possibilities include empty boxes that once contained tampons, toothpaste tubes or soap, or whatever else you’ve got under the sink. Have you ever hidden cash at home? Where did you put it?
