Gifting 10 shares of company stock might seem like a small amount to a university. But it’s a different story when Charles T. Munger, the longtime vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, is the donor. Mr. Munger recently gave 10 shares of Class A Berkshire Hathaway stock, which are currently valued at $115,900 apiece, to the Regents of the University of Michigan, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday. That makes the total gift worth nearly $1.2 million. The gift, which was earlier reported by Deal Journal, is not Mr. Munger’s first to the University of Michigan. Last year, he pledged $20 million to renovate a law school housing complex. In 2007, he donated $3 million for a lighting project in the Law Quadrangle.  Oddly enough, though he is one of the University of Michigan’s highest-profile alumni, Mr. Munger never graduated from the university. He began his studies in mathematics in 1941, but left in 1943 to enlist in the Army Air Corps. His lack of a college degree didn’t hurt him. He went on to Harvard Law School, founded the law firm Munger, Tolles (now known as Munger, Tolles & Olson) and eventually became Warren E. Buffett’s right-hand man at Berkshire. Not bad for a dropout. Advertisement
