LONDON — Some bonuses to British bankers were partly paid using government aid supplied to the beleaguered industry, John Vickers, chairman of a government-backed banking commission, said on Tuesday. Pressed by British lawmakers at a Parliamentary hearing, Mr. Vickers admitted that it was true “some of the bonuses have been financed that way.” “Much of the very understandable public feeling about bonuses is in the context where the taxpayer has been manifestly on the hook for the banks and yet some of those working in banks have been extremely handsomely rewarded by way of bonuses and otherwise,” he said. “So I think there is a link and that is another reason why it needs to be ironed out as far as possible.” The Independent Commission on Banking is chaired by Mr. Vickers, a former chief economist at the Bank of England and chairman of Britainâs economic regulator. It is not directly responsible for recommendations on whether to regulate bonuses. It was set up in June 2010 to consider changes to the banking sector that would make it more stable and competitive. Final proposals are due in September. Public outrage last year over compensation led British banks to adjust their pay packages. Royal Bank of Scotland and the Lloyds Banking Group, which continue to be partly owned by the government, pledged last year to reduce bonus payments and pay more of the bonuses in shares rather than cash.  Still, compensation at banks remains a contentious issue, with some shareholders voting against large compensation packages at annual shareholder meetings.  Eric Daniels, the retired chief executive of Lloyds, received Â£1.45 million ($2.3 million) for 2010, deferred for three years, and R.B.S.âs chief executive, Stephen Hester, could get Â£2.04 million even though the bank has yet to report an annual profit.
