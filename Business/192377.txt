An article about subprime auto lenders that was published Wednesday night in DealBook drew over 1,000 comments in less than 24 hours. The story centered on a piece of technology called the starter interrupt device, which allows lenders to remotely disable the engines of borrowers who donât pay on time as well as to track those carsâ movements with GPS â raising questions about the price of privacy. The storyâs popularity with readers both surprised and pleased its authors, Michael Corkery and Jessica Silver-Greenberg. âWe think it shows as journalists that reporting on an element of something people didnât realize exists â in this case, the subprime auto world â can be just as popular as a cat video,â said Ms. Silver-Greenberg. Mr. Corkery said: âIn some ways, the readers’ reaction to the piece reflects a debate nationally. At what cost â to individual borrowers and to the broader financial system â should lenders be making subprime loans again?â Subprime lenders are finding a market in a growing population âwho live in a parallel world where their wants and needs are met by pawnshops, payday lenders and other economic opportunists,â as John Meakin of Kentucky wrote. âMany are people who have had the economic ground cut from under them.â By MICHAEL CORKERY and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG Subprime lenders are increasingly relying on technology that allows them to track and disable delinquent borrowersâ vehicles with just a tap of a cellphone app. Some readers suggested that one reason subprime auto loans have made a comeback is that the Cash for Clunkers program has reduced the number of decent used cars available for sale by owner. â[The] Cash for Clunkers program wiped out the used-car market,â said Paul from Pittsburgh. âEvery vehicle we found below $5,000 was a pile of rusted rotting junk completely unsuitable for someone who needs reliable transportation â¦ a newer [car had] a price that required a sizable loan. Nothing in between whatsoever â¦ people with limited means are pretty boxed in.â â[If] the Cash for Clunkers program hadn’t pulled â¦ perfectly good used vehicles out of the marketplace, we would not have a secondary lending market. The government interference in the secondary auto marketplace did this,â wrote Ken Spicer of Alexandria, Va. Ms. Silver-Greenberg said her research showed her that there exists âa whole different set of rules for people who are poor. If you are poor, you are living in a fundamentally different world than people who have more money.â And what startles middle- and upper-middle-class readers of this story, she said, is that âthe steep price of credit [for the poor] is literally signing over access to your every movement.â Both authors agreed that the issue of privacy â what Ms. Silver-Greenberg called “the Big Brother element” â resonated with readers. The starter interrupt device serves as a kind of âscarlet letterâ for borrowers whose lenders install it in their cars, said Ms. Silver-Greenberg, referring to the shrill noise the device makes to alert a borrower that a payment is late. âThis device is literally going to scream at you as if [to say] you are poor, you are different.â âThe problem,âsaid GY of New York, âis not that the technology exists, [but] that you are not given the option to opt out. And that your movements and actions can be monitored without a warrant or your explicit consent, for legal or commercial purposes. Thatâs the larger picture.â âI too can see the advantage of being able to account for a significant asset that is the security for a debt. I also can understand why mortgage companies need a legal process to collect on bad loans. But none of that excuses the abusive behavior described in this article,â Ignatios from Georgia said. But JeffreyPtr of Florida disagreed with many readersâ critiques of the practice. âPrivacy concerns and the borrower’s feelings of dignity don’t seem that relevant here,â JeffreyPtr wrote. âThe lender offers a loan under certain known conditions. It is the borrower who makes the choice to accept them or not.â Safety concerns roused many readers, who were concerned by allegations that lenders turned off a car that was in motion. âI don’t disagree that many people have misplaced priorities, but to jeopardize one’s safety over 200-300 dollars?” said Dave from Ohio. The article was linked to by publications ranging on the political spectrum from the vivid scarlet of The Drudge Report to the deepest azure of The Huffington Post, touching off a culture clash in the commentsÂ â particularly over the nature of poverty. “Because the story was cited by a range of news sources, we got a flood of comments from readers — on both side of the political spectrum — that might not have otherwise seen the piece.  said Ms. Silver-Greenberg.  The issue of poverty and the reasons people find themselves unable to secure a traditional loan formed the basis for many readersâ assessments of the article, and also highlighted the political schism most clearly. âThese loans were an opportunity for those who had ruined their credit to start back on the road to financial recovery,â said Ron Strong of Arlington, Va. âThey blew it.â âThere’s a kind of stubbornness in our whole society with regard to sustainability of not only our own lifestyle but the sustainability of the economy of the country and our environment,â said Memi from Canada. âWe simply do not believe we can’t have what we want. Buy now pay later doesn’t work when you’re impoverished â not on the personal or any other level,â Lenders and those who have previously worked in repossession or collections chimed in, with varying opinions about the efficacy of the devices used by subprime auto lenders. âI find these tactics and conditions deplorable,âwrote br8kawy from Reno, Nev, who said he had worked as a creditor for 25 years. âWhenever you extend credit, you assess risk. With these devices, there is little risk of losing collateral, so why would the loan be charged interest as if it was a high risk?â But one former lender, Sharon from Miami Beach, said that âcars are so difficult to repossess since they can be moved quite easily! By disabling them once the borrower is in default, it makes collections much easier and car loans cheaper and more available to more people.â David from Los Angeles offered some advice: âThese people should adjust their spending and take the bus.â EB from California disagreed. âIt’s all well and good to say that poor people should have to take a bus, and that if they took on the debt of a car they couldn’t afford, then shame on them,â EB wrote. âThe truth is more complicated â¦ There are some places where it is almost impossible to get anywhere without a car. What to do then? How do you get to work? Take your children to school? Loans like this may be the only choice.â Advertisement
