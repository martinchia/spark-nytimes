Goldman Sachs will divide $3.8 billion among 35,400 employees in the third quarter, a pay pool reduced significantly from the period a year earlier, The Financial Times reported. The cuts result from a slump in the bankâs profit as a result of a slowdown in trading, as well as the fact that Goldman is now in the spotlight over salary and bonuses, The Financial Times said. The bankâs move could lead to dissatisfaction, particularly among its star bankers and traders, whose salary took a hit last year as well, the newspaper notes. The Financial Times wrote: During the first nine months of 2010, Goldman accumulated $13.2 billion for compensation and benefits or 43 percent of its total revenue. That represents an average of around $370,000 per employee, compared with $527,000 a year ago. David Viniar, the finance chief, told investors the pay accruals were the lowest nine-month compensation-revenue ratio since Goldmanâs listing in 1999, but declined to say whether the bank would try to keep it at that level for the rest of 2010. Goldmanâs earnings for the third quarter compared unfavorably with those of Bank of America, which succeeded in improving profit despite facing the same market conditions, The Financial Times said.
