 Portraits of women entrepreneurs. We just publishedÂ a conversation with Hanny Lerner, the founder and president of MOD Restoration, a furniture reupholstering company in Brooklyn. In the interview, Ms. Lerner, 29, who grew up in a Hasidic community with limited information about the outside world, discussed how she managed to get up to speed and grow her business, which had 2013 sales of just under $2 million and employs about 10. Ms. Lerner, who broke from her family and community when she was 21, said confidence has been one key to her success. Itâs important to believe âyou are entitled to be very successful, and thatâs the end of the story,â she said. With that mindset, she was able to talk her way into her first job â in interactive marketing â without any experience, and win Crate & Barrel as Modâs first customer. Mentors, including her former boss at the marketing firm, have also been important to her. She said he predicted she would one day start a company, and urged her to join the Entrepreneurs’ Organization when she did. Eventually, she followed his advice. From there, Ms. Lerner met many more mentors and advisers, continually seeking out those whose businesses were ahead of hers in terms of growth. Because Ms. Lerner was not a design industry insider, networking has been especially critical. âWhen people ask how they can help me, I always have an answer,â she said. Her big goals include doing work for the White House. Toward that end, she recently attempted to contact the Treasury secretary through a friend who works for the Italian government. She said the secretaryâs assistant loved Modâs proposal, and forwarded it on for vetting. To learn more about Ms. Lernerâs background, take a look at this video from the Story Exchange, a nonprofit media organization that shares the personal and professional stories of entrepreneurial women around the world.
