12:11 p.m. | Updated Cracker Barrel Old Country Store said on Friday that it had adopted a shareholder rights plan, or a poison pill, after an activist investor moved to shake up the board and gain a major stake in the restaurant and retailer. The company’s largest shareholder, Biglari Holdings — run by Sardar Biglari — applied for regulatory permission to buy as much as 49.99 percent of the stock on the market. He is also looking to join the Cracker Barrel board. “Over the last several months I have spent time with the board and management to understand their approach to the business and to their shareholders â and it has become increasingly clear to us that top leadership has shaped a culture that lacks, inter alia, accountability, transparency, and stock ownership,” Mr. Biglari said in letter to shareholders, which was filed this month with regulators. The shareholder rights plan would kick into effect after an investor acquires 10 percent of the company. Biglari owns 9.3 percent of Cracker Barrel. The poison pill would not, however, apply to a cash offer for the entire company. The board of Cracker Barrel said it had implemented the poison pill “to assure that all of Cracker Barrelâs shareholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the company and to guard against abusive tactics to gain control of Cracker Barrel without paying all shareholders a premium for that control.” Cracker Barrel’s move followed weeks of negotiations, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told DealBook on Friday. After Mr. Biglari approached the company about wanting to become a director in early July, at the end of the month the restaurant operator made the unusual offer of letting him pick two board candidates. But it would not let him become a director himself, citing antitrust rules. The two sides spent much of August negotiating further terms of the plan, but by September Mr. Biglari had decided to instead nominate himself as a director candidate. When he disclosed that he had received regulatory clearance to buy up to 49.99 percent of the company, Cracker Barrel and its advisers decided to put the pill in place, this person said. Mr. Biglari has been the aggressor before. In 2007, he muscled his way into Steak ‘n Shake, which was struggling with a slumping stock and poor financials. Following a tussle with management, he took over the restaurant chain. Last year, the company was renamed Biglari Holdings, a vehicle for the chairman’s investment strategy. Along with Steak ‘n Shake, it owns Western Sizzlin, and has unsuccessfully made a play for other businesses. “BH is in the business of owning other businesses in whole and in part,” Mr. Biglari, a devotee of Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren E. Buffett, wrote in recent shareholder letter.  Like Steak ‘n Shake, Mr. Biglari is jumping into Cracker Barrel at a moment of weakness. Since December, the company’s shares have slipped to roughly $40 from $59.  “My aim was to join the Board of Cracker Barrel to share my expertise and experiences â all in an endeavor to create substantial and sustainable shareholder value for all owners,” Mr. Biglari said in a letter.
