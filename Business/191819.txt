The Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking more time to respond to a Congressional request regarding how the agency handled referrals about suspicious trading activity at the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors. In a letter last month, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, asked the agency to describe its handling of about 20 instances of trading at the hedge fund that were referred to it. The trades were handed to the commission by the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency, Wall Street’s self-regulatory body, over the last decade. The letter, sent May 24, asked the agency to respond by Tuesday. “The S.E.C. officials said they need time to be sure they are allowed to share the information I requested,” Mr. Grassley said in a statement. “Iâm willing to give enough time to allow for a comprehensive response.”  A spokesman for the S.E.C. declined to comment. The SAC transactions under scrutiny relate to purchases of companies ahead of mergers and other market moving events, though the specifics of the trades have not been publicly released. Neither SAC nor its founder, Steven A. Cohen, have been accused of any wrongdoing. Nonetheless, the firm has found itself the unhappy recipient of regulatory attention. The S.E.C. is looking into trades in health care stocks made by the hedge fund, as well as its use of expert-network firms, according to a person briefed on the matter. Expert networks are agencies that connect industry specialists with money managers.  Additionally, two former SAC employees pleaded guilty this year to making illegal trades based on confidential information. Mr. Grassley has been a vocal critic of the agency in the past and conducted a similar inquiry in 2009 related to Pequot Capital Management, a once powerful hedge fund that has since shuttered. Mr. Grassley has also taken the agency to task for its failure to uncover the multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme perpetrated by Bernard L. Madoff.  In his most recent effort, Mr. Grassley said that he expected the agency to respond in a timely fashion.  “If the information isnât forthcoming, I want credible evidence that withholding the materials actually would impede an active investigation,” he said in the statement. “Otherwise, if the S.E.C. isnât taking action, thereâs no reason for the agency to withhold the information.â    Advertisement
