Updated, 3:23 p.m. | Three months ago, Sandell Asset Management took on a midsize restaurant operator. Now the activist hedge fund has its sights set on one of Canadaâs biggest energy companies. Sandell Â sent a letter to the TransCanada Corporation on Monday urging the company to overhaul its business strategy by taking better advantage of an affiliate that pays no taxes. The hedge fund also called on the pipeline operator to weigh a spinoff of its power business. The move highlights the boldness of activist investors as they seek to take on bigger targets. Buoyed in many cases by support from traditional investors â a phenomenon once considered unthinkable â these hedge funds have trained their sights on the likes of Apple, eBay and other large corporations. Now Sandell, which in August convinced fellow shareholders in Bob Evans Farms to vote for four of its eight board nominees, is taking on one of the biggest oil pipeline operators in North America. TransCanada operates roughly 35,500 miles of natural gas pipelines and about 407 billion cubic feet of gas storage. And its power plants generate more than 11,800 megawatts of electricity. Sandell first reached out to the energy company about three months ago, discussing matters like its corporate strategy, according to people briefed on the matter. But TransCanada executives said they were largely content with the current layout of the business. While the exact size of the hedge fundâs stake is unclear, Sandell says it is a Â âsignificant shareholderâ Â in the energy company. TransCanadaâs market value as of Friday was about $35 billion. The companyâs shares have risen more than 17 percent in the last year. But Sandell Â argues that TransCanada is not taking full advantage of its master limited partnership affiliate, which holds a number of its assets. A number of other pipeline operators, including Enbridge, Spectra Energy and the Williams Companies, regularly deposit assets into their so-called M.L.P.s. Those structures let these companies pass on profits to investors without paying taxes. In its letter, Sandell argues that TransCanadaâs strategy of only putting select assets in its M.L.P., described as a âcash A.T.M.â plan, limits both the companyâs and the affiliateâs potential profits. The hedge fund says that the pipeline operator should either put all of its oil and natural gas assets into the partnership, or at least set a schedule of âdrop-downsâ of assets into the M.L.P. The hedge fund also suggests that TransCanada should study a potential spinoff of its power unit, which it believes is in a much more volatile business that muddies the valuation of the overall company. Sandellâs argument is that TransCanada should focus on the fast-growing energy infrastructure business. Spinning off the energy business could also help attract a top-class leader for the unit, the hedge fund also plans to say in its letter. Some of Sandellâs arguments echo analyst reports from earlier in the year, notably a note from Citigroup in June that suggested a breakup of TransCanada could push its stock price. In response, TransCanada said in a statement that it planned to maintain its current strategy, arguing that the activist hedge fund’s proposals were “flawed.” The company added that it has delivered a 14 percent annualized shareholder return for the past 14 years. “We have a well-defined strategic plan to increase long-term shareholder value, including our strong focus on pipelines and power generation opportunities, and we remain focused on continuing to deliver on this plan successfully,” TransCanada said in a statement.   Advertisement
