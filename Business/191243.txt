The struggles of a business trying to survive. About half of my employees had been involved in devising the profit-sharing program I have been writing about the past few weeks, but the other half had heard only rumors. So I made a formal announcement of the program at the end of April. Before the meeting, I taped a large printout of the program, as shown above, to our whiteboard. I explained the program, starting with our problem of low profits, and my desire to increase production while sharing the wealth in a rational and predictable way. Then I explained the concept of dividing the profits among the investors, the idea generator (me), and those who do the work. I described the calculation of the bonus pool: how it would be divided into two portions, to be paid out upon turning a profit and hitting ship targets, and how those portions would be allocated.  At that point, I did not make a prediction as to how much the bonus might amount to for each worker. I did not want to create expectations that we might not meet. But I did go through the first quarterâs results. As it happened, we had bombed in January, shipping only $79,673 while spending $183,189. So we started the quarter with a big loss. February and March had been better: we had made money in both months. But we still ended the quarter with revenue of $513,243, costs totaling $549,567, and a consequent loss of $36,324. If we had hit our first-quarter ship target of $600,000, without spending any more money, the profit pool would have been more than $15,000. My workers were paying attention through all of this, but there were not many questions and it did not seem as though the news made much of an impact. âYou should be happy,â I said. âYou all just got a raise.â That didnât do much to lift the energy in the room, either — cabinetmakers are a pretty stolid set of people. The meeting adjourned, and everyone went back to work. Fast forward eight weeks. In April and May, we continued the pattern of the first quarter: a month of loss, followed by a month of profit. During those two months combined, we shipped $383,700 and spent $387,325. We were still a little bit in the hole, but the average monthly shipment was much higher than in the first quarter. And we were about to work on several jobs that we had sold at very high prices — contingent on making delivery by the end of the second quarter. These had the potential to be very profitable. In the last week of May I decided to see whether I could make a prediction as to how our quarter might finish. I sat down with my shop manager and we listed all of the jobs that he thought we could ship before the end of the quarter. It was a long list, and if the shop performed as he predicted, we would ship another $375,000. That would mean a substantial profit for the quarter. I spent some time putting a summary of my calculations up on our main whiteboard. I made a reasonable estimate of our monthly costs and shipments for June, and then calculated a potential quarterly profit: more than $163,000. Subtract our first-quarter loss of $36,324, multiply whatâs left by 0.3, and the resulting profit pool would be $38,000. Divide that into two parts, the first going to all workers (the profit bonus) and the second going to the production workers (the production bonus). It added up to a potential payout of $1,187.50 for each worker, and an additional $1,461 for the production people. Not bad. Then I listed every job we had to ship to make that bonus. I divided them into two groups: those we had to ship to break even for the quarter, which were listed in blue ink, and those that took us into profitability, which I listed in green ink. The value of each job went into either a ânot shippedâ or a âshippedâ column, with a total value written at the top. I would update the totals as we shipped each project. It would be easy to see exactly where we were on our quest for profits. I finished this at the end of the last Friday in May. The following Monday I went through the list, and circled the potential payout in red ink and drew a few stars around it, for emphasis. This time, there was more of a reaction — everyone looked happy at the thought of that large of a bonus. We finished the meeting, and they went to work. And they performed like heroes for the rest of the month. Each morning I would update all of the numbers. We shipped all the break-even jobs in the first week of June, and then moved into profitability. By the end of June, we had shipped everything on the list. At the first meeting in July, I promised that I would make an actual payout the following week, along with the regular paycheck. We would need to finish tabulating expenses before seeing whether the payout would be equal to the prediction. In the end, it was very close: our quarterly profit was $161,540, from revenue of $747,495. Subtracting the loss from the first quarter and multiplying by 0.3 resulted in a profit pool of $37,565. My actual payout would be $1,173.90 per worker in profit bonus and an additional $1,444.80 to each production worker for exceeding our shipping target. While confirming these numbers, I congratulated everyone on a job well done. The production guys had worked hard enough to make, on average, an extra $4 per hour. But I didnât want everyone to think that this was a foregone conclusion from here on. I explained that we had had an unusually good quarter, aided by a couple of very profitable jobs, and that we would be unlikely to repeat the result regularly. I stressed that they should be conservative about planning for the future and not count on regular payments of this size. The mood as the meeting ended was oddly muted. Maybe it was because of this warning, maybe it was because they had internalized the program and now saw it as a just reward for their efforts, or maybe it was because they are craftsmen and just do not emote much. At any rate, I felt a bit of a letdown. Only two of the guys thanked me for starting the program. The next payroll was going to be a whopper, about double our normal nut of $40,000 — and I was worried about our cash position. I finished June with $138,590 on hand. One of the jobs we delivered at the end of June, worth more than $89,000, had gone to a client that we had worked with many times in the past. This client normally paid very quickly, within a week of delivery, even though our terms allowed 30 days from delivery. But unlike most of our clients, it had not paid a deposit. So I was sweating whether the client would continue the pattern — or take the whole 30 days. The $89,000 was going to make a big difference in my working capital. I started logging into my bank account a couple of times a day, to see whether the transfer had come through. We pay on every other Tuesday, and the payroll with the profit distribution was scheduled for July 9. On Friday afternoon, July 5, I had just $99,839 in the bank — enough to cover the payroll, but after that I would be very short of cash. Worrying about this ruined my weekend. On Sunday, I decided that I couldnât risk it. I would do something that I had not had to do since 2009. I emptied my personal cash reserves and wrote a check for $80,000 to the company. I deposited it the following morning. When Tuesday morning arrived, there were no incoming transfers to be seen. I submitted our payroll to Paychex, with the profit distribution added on. Then I went home to spend the rest of the day caring for my children. I got a call from my bookkeeper after lunch: the customer payment had arrived just after I left. All of my worrying had been for nothing! (I repaid myself later that week.) After handing out the paychecks,Â I spent a good amount of time trying to decide what I should think about the reaction I got. It would have been nice to have received a little more gratitude — after all, these guys were well paid to start with, and I had just voluntarily given up a hefty share of the profits, for little thanks. On the other hand, it looked as though the program had done exactly what I wanted it to do: prompted a change in company behavior that resulted in a hefty profit. No matter how I felt personally, I couldnât deny that both my workers and I were better off. The share of the profits that went to me and my partners was almost $80,000 — although I will not be distributing any of that until I see how the rest of the year goes. I decided to grow up a bit, and to stop looking for gratitude from my workers. After all, they are the ones who are doing the vast majority of the work. Iâll take my satisfaction from seeing them perform well and from the additional money they are putting in all of our pockets. As I write this, we are coming into the third month of the third quarter, and I have again put up a list of jobs that I expect to complete. We donât have any supermoneymakers this quarter, so our shipments are likely to total $660,000 or so. Not bad, but spending has been up a bit in the last two months, so we might not even break even. (Incidentally, we accrued the profit payouts back into the second-quarter numbers, to keep that large payroll from hamstringing the third-quarter results. We will be doing this from here on out: a preliminary profit calculation after each quarter ends, then a payout in the first payroll of the next quarter, and then a revised quarterly result with the payout subtracted.) It will be interesting to see how the guys react to a less spectacular quarter — and whether the profits return for the fourth quarter. I have not fully made up my mind as to whether introducing profit sharing was a good idea. I think it will take at least a year to have enough results for a fair evaluation. But as I said, no one is worse off, and it just might inspire the change I have been seeking. UPDATE: There’s a follow-up to this post. Paul Downs founded Paul Downs Cabinetmakers in 1986.
