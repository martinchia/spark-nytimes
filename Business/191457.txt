Updated at 11:04 a.m. / To reflect that another cash mob was held last week in Cleveland. Looking for a way to spend your dollars locally during the holiday season? Want to go out for a drink and a snack afterwards? A âcash mobâ may be just the ticket. The concept is simple: Organizers select a local business and urge people via Twitter or Facebook to shop there at a certain time. Cash mobs began popping up in recent months in Buffalo and Cleveland, and they are spreading to other locales too. (An organizer in Canada is promoting âTwelve Days of Cash Mobs.â) As with many social-media inspired phenomena, itâs not entirely clear who came up with the initial idea, but it seems to be catching on. At the urging of a local blogger, shoppers staged a cash mob at a Buffalo wine store last summer. More recently, cash mobs have descended on a bookstore in Cleveland, and on a seller of locally made jewelry and art in San Diego, Calif. Andrew Samtoy, 32, a full-time lawyer and part-time cash mob impresario in Cleveland, said the aimed is to support local businesses while reclaiming the fun and spontaneity of flash mobs. (Flash mobs began as a lighthearted way for people to gather together to sing and dance in public, but morphed into something destructive as the notion was adopted by thugs and troublemakers.) âWe want to support local businesses that employ people and build wealth in the community,â Mr. Samtoy said in a telephone interview. A cash mob targeted a Cleveland bookstore in November, and another Cleveland event was held last week. A highlight of a cash mob — at least, in the Cleveland version — is gathering afterwards at local watering hole to tip a mug and get to know fellow mobbers. The nearby city of Kent, Ohio, has been cash-mobbing, too. On a blog about cash mobs, Mr. Samtoy and his compatriots suggest choosing a business that is supportive of the local community, and not identifying the store too far ahead of time to create an element of surprise. âIn my opinion, life has become far too ordered,â he said. (Typically, a meeting place is announced a week ahead of time, and the identity of the store is revealed when everyone gathers.) The spending goal should be no more than $20 a person, although people can of course spend more if they choose. And organizers should give the store owners a heads up, so they aren’t overwhelmed. Mr. Samtoy added that he wasn’t opposed to big business, but that small businesses deserve support so they can grow. Do you think a cash mob is an effective way to spend your dollars locally?
