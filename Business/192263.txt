The Brazilian bidders seeking to take over Chiquita Brands International raised their offer on Wednesday, making a definitive proposal to acquire the banana producer for about $660 million. If accepted, the deal would scuttle Chiquita’s plans to acquire Fyffes, an Irish rival, which would create a banana supplier bigger than the Dole Food Company, and allow the American company to complete an inversion, lowering its taxes. The Cutrale Group and the Safra Group, a wholesale orange juice maker and a private bank, surprised the markets this summer by making an all-cash proposal to take Chiquita private. Though it was unconventional, the Cutrale-Safra team had an opening because Chiquita’s shares had fallen since the company announced its intent to acquire Fyffes. Chiquita dismissed the first offer of $13 a share from Cutrale-Safra, but later allowed the group to conduct due diligence. Now, having examined Chiquita’s books, Cutrale-Safra has made a formal offer of $14 a share to buy the company. âOur all-cash offer provides certain value to Chiquita shareholders on a timely basis,” Cutrale-Safra said in a statement. “It is more favorable to the Chiquita shareholders than the proposed combination with Fyffes, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of our offer.” The Brazilian group said it believed Chiquita shareholders still did not support the company’s plan to buy Fyffes. The terms of that deal were recently renegotiated to make them more favorable for Chiquita. “We believe the investment marketplace recognizes the significant risks and issues inherent in the Chiquita-Fyffes combination, all of which cast serious doubts about the potential business performance of the combined Chiquita-Fyffes and the ability to integrate as well as realize potential synergies,” Cutrale-Safra said. Cutrale-Safra says its offer is not subject to any financing conditions, Chiquita did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
