Regulators agreed to support a draft proposal to regulate overseas derivatives trading, a move that comes just days after internal wrangling delayed the plan and prompted several last-minute changes.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced on Friday that its five members voted unanimously to support the rule, which would apply new derivatives rules not only to banks in the United States, but also to American banks that have foreign units. The rules, which impose capital standards and other new oversight measures, would also affect foreign banks that conduct significant derivatives trading in the United States. The overhaul gained new focus after JPMorganâs multibillion-dollar trading loss in London. âThe recent events of JPMorgan Chase, where it executed swaps through its London branch, are a stark reminder of this reality of modern finance,â Gary Gensler, the agencyâs chairman, said in a statement.  The proposal now enters a public comment period, after which the agency will vote to complete the plan.  The vote, which occurred behind the scenes over the last several days, was initially scheduled for a public meeting last week. But as commissioners staged an 11th-hour debate over the fine print of the proposal, the agency canceled the meeting only hours before it was scheduled to start. The agency provided no explanation, sending out a cryptic e-mail that it would “no longer hold a scheduled meeting on June 21, 2012.” The final negotiations, occurring between Mr. Gensler and one of his fellow Democratic commissioners, yielded a more flexible proposal that gives Wall Street additional time to comply.  The tweaks put the proposal back on track. Even the agencyâs two Republican members signed on, at least for now. Both Republicans, however, issued concurring opinions that spelled out concerns about the scope of the plan.  Scott OâMalia, one of the Republican members, stated “strong reservations about the statutory authority” of the proposal and expressed concern about “the commissionâs decision to issue interpretive guidance instead of a formal rule-making.” Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the commission who supported the earlier and tougher version of the proposal, praised the agencyâs effort.  “This is about a balanced and thoughtful approach â a planetary patchwork of harmonized financial and markets rules of the road,” he said in a statement.
