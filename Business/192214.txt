My last post — “The Hidden Costs of Hiring” — got an unusual response: all of the commenters agreed with me! Clearly, the costs of a bad hire more than justify taking the extra time to try to hire the right person. But the comments also revealed some truths about how hard it is to get an honest reference when evaluating a prospective employee. Here are three comments that speak to this: ââ¦ checking references can be a taxing process and will not always yield conclusive evidence.â — Jonathan âMany times you can call references until you are blue in the face, but not get anywhere.â — Liz âThe inability to really check references is a big negative in making a successful hire. We never could check the most recent business where a person is working, and thus we would miss many years of history that would clearly point out problems.â— Richard All of these comments are true, but I fear that they may lead to the conclusion that we should stop trying. I know it can be hard, and I know it can be frustrating. And it definitely takes time. But compared with making a bad hire, itâs a walk in the park.  Think about it. You consider hiring 10 people over the course of a year. You check references, and they are very good for five of the candidates. The references for another four donât say much, if anything. One reference for the last person says, âIâd rather not elaborate,â — or, âThat guy? Heâs a drug pusher.â Those are both actual responses I have gotten to reference calls I have made. I didnât hire the drug pusher (I didnât need one). The other person was already scheduled for a second interview, so I asked her what the reference meant. Without hesitation, she blurted out, âIâm difficult to work with.” All of a sudden the drug pusher didnât look so bad. I didnât hire the second person either. Was it worth taking the time to call the references for 10 people to avoid hiring this one? Absolutely. Did I save $5,000? $10,000? $20,000? Maybe a lawsuit? It’s also important to think about how you check references. If the person you call wants to say nice things about the candidate, it’s easy. Frequently, however, the person you call may be reluctant to tell you something you would like to know, whether for legal reasons or out of a sense of guilt or to avoid the wrath of the former employee. But most people don’t want to lie, and there are things you can do to help them help you. First of all, the best people I have hired have all gotten enthusiastic references. If someone has been a great employee, can it really be that hard to find someone who will say so — even given all of the lawyers and company policies that stand in the way? A co-worker? An ex-co-worker? No one will take the risk of saying something nice about a great employee? Possible, but I think it’s unlikely. As far as I am concerned, I think it’s irresponsible of employers to refuse to give references for someone who has worked at a company for years and done a great job just because the legal department has decided that is the easiest way to avoid getting sued. But it is what it is. Still, many employers donât have a legal department, and they canât stop themselves from being human. Here is my favorite question: âWould you hire this person back?â âNo,” is a typical answer. “Itâs against our company policy.” âI understand. But what if it werenât against your company policy?” I can tell you this: If the employee was fired, the reference will not be able to say, “Yes, we would hire this person back.” You just want to make it easy for the reference to give you a hint, which is all you need. So, for instance, you donât ask, âWhat can you tell me about the person?â That’s going to get a canned response. Instead you might try, âI get the sense that he is overstating his contacts in the industry. He said he knows every design firm in Chicago.â The idea is to ask specific questions about factors that would make or break the hiring decision. If you are checking references, there must have been several things the person said in the interview that you found appealing. Verify them. Many times, itâs not what the references say, itâs what they donât say. You have to read between the lines. Even just verifying employment dates and final wages can be revealing (if you want to check references at a current employer, you can make the hiring contingent upon those references checking out). Many people lie on their resume. You make it easy for them to get away with it if you donât verify. Over the past 33 years, I have had hundreds of employees. But I would guess that I’ve been called for a reference maybe 10 times. And even when people call, they usually aren’t smart about it. One caller asked me if my former employee was easy to work with. Actually, she was very difficult, which put me in an awkward spot. I laughed and said, âWhoâs easy to work with!â He could have followed up by saying, âIâll take it that she is not the easiest person to deal with” — which would have forced me to give him a little more. But he didn’t. He wasn’t listening. He hired her. People frequently call for reference checks and supply answers to their own questions. One caller gave me two or three reasons why he was going to hire my former employee. He never asked me if what she had told him was true. All I said was that she was very nice. I did not volunteer anything else. He got what he wanted from the reference — an opportunity to talk to himself without me correcting him. He hung up feeling good that he had gotten a good reference. What he really got was a very mediocre employee. If you are not good at checking references, have someone else make the calls or hire an outside service to make them. They areÂ  just one piece of the hiring protocol. They are not perfect. They donât always work. Most times, they won’t even matter. Neither does wearing a seat belt — most times.
