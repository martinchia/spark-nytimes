Validus Holdings, a reinsurer based in Bermuda, took its $3.2 billion bid for Transatlantic Holdings directly to shareholders on Monday, in an attempt to trump Allied World Holdings in a takeover fight. Transatlantic said on Monday that it would review the cash-and-stock offer and respond within 10 business days.  Allied World Holdings and Transatlantic, formerly the reinsurance unit of the American International Group, said last month that they planned to merge. The deal, also worth about $3.2 billion, would give Transatlantic the majority of the new company. After Validus made a rival offer this month, Transatlantic said that while it did not consider the new bid to be superior, it would enter into discussions with Validus. But those talks have failed to materialize. In a presentation this month, Allied highlighted what it described as weaknesses in the Validus proposal, including the fact that Transatlantic would own a minority of the new company and that its management’s representation on the board was uncertain. Ed Noonan, head of Validus, said that while his company hoped “to work cooperatively with Transatlantic,” he also indicated he was unwilling to grant the Transatlantic board the power to block the Validus bid, which it had demanded as a condition to enter talks. “We do not believe that it is in your stockholders’ best interests to give the Transatlantic board a veto right over whether our superior proposal is made available,” he said in a letter addressed to Transatlantic management. Transatlantic shares fell 5 cents on Friday, closing at $52.50. Validus shares fell 17 cents, or 0.61 percent, to close at $27.70 on Friday. Transatlantic, based in New York, has hired Goldman Sachs and Moelis as financial advisers and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher as legal counsel.  Validus hired Greenhill and JPMorgan as advisers and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom as legal counsel. Advertisement
