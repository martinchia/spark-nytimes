Abercrombie & Fitch continues on its path to move the retailer’s incorporation to Ohio from Delaware.  When I last wrote about the company in December, Abercrombie had just filed a preliminary proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission â part of the process since shareholders must approve the reincorporation, as per Delaware and Ohio law.  Under S.E.C. rules, a company must wait 10 days after the filing of the preliminary proxy statement before mailing it to shareholders. During this time, the S.E.C. will decide whether to review and comment on the document. If it does comment, the mailing will be delayed, usually by a month or two.   Ten days elapsed without Abercrombie mailing the proxy. I had thought that this meant that the S.E.C. had sprung to action.  But on Jan. 20, Abercrombie filed a definitive proxy statement and mailed the proxy to its shareholders. The final proxy statement was virtually unchanged from the preliminary one.  This is unfortunate. This reincorporation is important to Abercrombie shareholders. By moving to Ohio from Delaware, Abercrombie is changing the rules that govern its relationship with shareholders.   From my perspective, the Abercrombie proxy statement is a model of what I call disclosure nondisclosure. That is, disclosure that appears to be disclosure but really tells you very little about the actual matter.   This technique is used all too often. The S.E.C., if it had commented, might have forced Abercrombie to address this issue. But make your own decisions and read the proxy statement. As I discussed in my December article, Abercrombie still provides four reasons why shareholders should vote for the reincorporation. Three of the four do not seem to justify this move, at least to me.  These three reasons are: 1) To obtain operational benefits and commit to Ohio as Abercrombie’s headquarters
2) To reduce its tax liability by $180,000 a year
3) To improve Abercrombie’s ability to retain and enhance directors generally because, among other reasons, it is harder to obtain a judgment of liability in that state for alleged misconduct  Letâs take each of these quickly in turn.   With respect to the first reason, a majority of public companies are incorporated in Delaware without a problem even though their headquarters are in other states. This is a common practice. And if Abercrombie is so concerned about bringing operations and benefits to Ohio, why does it not bring real business like the manufacturing to the state? Most of the clothes its sells are manufactured outside Ohio. In regard to the second reason, $180,000 in tax benefits is not material. And in any event, it’s likely offset by the fact that Delaware is considered to have the highest quality corporate law and specialized judiciary.  In my December article I already cast a doubtful eye on the third reason. I stated that âa majority of the public companies in the United States are incorporated in Delaware and they donât seem to have problems obtaining and retaining directors. And in fact, Delaware has been quite protective of directors, even rejecting liability on claims arising from the financial crisis against Citigroup among others.â Since these three issues don’t provide a believable rationale for the reincorporation, we are left to scrutinize the last one.  This fourth reason is phrased by Abercrombie as âreincorporating into Ohio would provide us with an opportunity to address a number of corporate governance matters in a manner that appropriately protects and benefits the Company and its stakeholders.â   The proxy carefully does not say that the change will benefit the companyâs shareholders, but that it will benefit the companyâs stakeholders. Stakeholders can have a number of interpretations but commonly in the corporate context includes not only shareholders, but employees, officers, directors and society in general. In other words, Abercrombie manages to avoid the question of whether this reincorporation will actually benefit shareholders.  So how does Abercrombie say the move benefit stakeholders?   Among the âbenefitsâ cited by the proxy is that shareholders will now be able to act by written consent. It further notes that such action may be limited by Ohio law without specifying how.   You have to read further into the proxy to learn that such consent must be unanimous, an impossibility to obtain for a public company with thousands of shareholders.   Abercrombie also points out that it’s going to redeem a poison pill in connection with the reincorporation. But as the proxy notes, this is only for the âpresent time,â which I understand to mean right now.  As for tomorrow, the board reserves the right to put a poison pill back in place. So, two of the four benefits cited by A&F appear to be ephemeral.   Then there’s the shareholder hostile landscape of Ohio. Depending upon how you count, the state has five anti-takeover laws, which includes an anti-arbitrage provision that prohibits arbs from purchasing greater than a 0.5 percent stake in the company once a takeover has been announced.   Abercrombie also discloses that Ohio is arguably more friendly in terms of protecting directors from liability.  I could go on, but you get the picture. While many of these issues are also spelled out in the proxy on Pages 30 through 40, they are not set forth right after the âbenefitsâ the proxy lists. In the end, I count two real benefits of this reincorporation, which Abercrombie’s provides against 10 pages of disclosure concerning mostly anti-takeover and other laws. These are not listed under the reasons section. And in fact, Abercrombie does not detail how these anti-takeover and other laws are weighed in the benefit calculus to shareholders.   This is the disclosure nondisclosure part. This proxy may be technically correct in its disclosure, but a reader can easily fail to put it all together. Moreover, you are left wondering whether the proxy statement truly discloses Abercrombie’s real reason for the reincorporation.   In my prior post, I speculated that the reason could instead be to position the company for a management buyout.  But it also could be to have freer rein with compensation decisions or for the board to be able to adopt firmer takeover defenses.  But these are mere suppositions, as Abercrombie has not disclosed any of these as the reasons for the reincorporation. And I have no problem if Abercrombie shareholders, with full information, approve this reincorporation. It is their decision after all to make the judgment about the benefits of Ohio law and some people do believe that these protections are beneficial to shareholders.   The issue is whether this proxy statement gives them the full information they need to decide in a comprehensible format.   This may seem like gloom and doom. But in the interests of clarifying things, I did put in a number of calls to Abercrombie investor relations, which were not returned.  So I am left to only speculate. The Abercrombie shareholder meeting will be Feb. 28.  It will be interesting to see if shareholders have the same questions that I do.  Advertisement
