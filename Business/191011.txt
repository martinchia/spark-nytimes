  The notion of legal education is colliding with the profit motive inÂ Charleston, S.C., where âfor profitâ and âprivate equityâ are being tossed around as dirty words in the fight against the acquisition of a regional law school. The battle centers on the proposed acquisition of the Charleston Law School by the InfiLaw System, which runs three for-profit law schools and is owned by the private equity firm Sterling Partners. Opponents are skeptical of InfiLawâs for-profit business model. The irony is that the law schoolâs current owners have taken out more than $25 million in profits over the last few years without protest. It all may just boil down to snobbery and who should be allowed to attend law school. Five prominent local judges and lawyers started Charleston Law School in 2002, and it was intended to turn a profit for them from the start. TheÂ American Bar AssociationÂ has accredited 203 law schools, and not all of them can beÂ Harvard. Charleston is unranked by U.S. News and World Report, meaning it falls in the lowest tier of the schools it rates. But Charlestonâs founders never intended it to be Harvard. Instead, they wanted to give the state a second law school in addition to the one at theÂ University of South CarolinaÂ to feed graduates into local lawyersâ jobs. Like the majority of law schools that are not national research institutions, Charleston is regional and more focused on training. These schools depend on local ties and employment trends to succeed. Charleston Law School has performed fairly well and even prospered for the owners as the foundersâ ties to Charleston andÂ South CarolinaÂ aided the students. Enrollment grew to more than 700. But the school is now struggling to attract students in the face of a general decline in the legal job market and the cries of some that law school in general is a sham. Total applications at law schools have declined 40 percent over the last few years, and enrollment at Charleston declined 24.2 percent from 2011 to 2013. Enter the InfiLaw System. There are six for-profit law schools in the country, and InfiLaw owns three of them:Â ArizonaÂ Summit Law School, Charlotte School of Law and Florida Coastal School of Law. Last year, InfiLaw agreed to buy Charleston from its founders and take over its management. Law is a regulated business, so the purchase would need approvals from the A.B.A. and the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education. It was at this point that the uproar erupted. Alumni and students complained, withÂ one article describing the legal communityÂ as âhighly skeptical.â A majority of Charlestonâs faculty alsoÂ came out against the acquisition, saying that a sense of community had been replaced by a culture of âintimidation and fear.â The critics argue that InfiLawâs three law schools have lax admissions standards, too much attrition and inordinate transfer rates. Above the Law, the scrappy website geared toward lawyers and law students,Â summed up the criticsâ fearsÂ by calling InfiLaw a âdiploma mill.â InfiLawâs opponents scored a victory last week when they succeeded in persuading a committee of the South Carolina Commission on Higher Education to recommend 3 to 1 that the stateâs higher education regulator reject the sale. InfiLaw was naturally disappointed. âWe are confident that we provide the brightest future for continuing the proud traditions and commitment to excellence of the Charleston School of Law, its faculty, staff and students,â Kathy Heldman, spokeswoman for InfiLaw, said in a statement. Charlestonâs supporters celebrated, with a lawyer representing the alumni association saying that âsanity seems to be restored.â The only problem is that the previous state of affairs was sane only for Charlestonâs owners. In the hearing, it was revealed that the five owners had taken out $25 million in profits over the last few years and had received a $6 million advance to buy out two of the owners as well as an unknown amount for renting space to the law school. How was the money made? It appears to be off the students. Exact profits for Charlestonâs owners are not public, but filings with the commission disclosed that Charlestonâs cost per student was $20,995 in 2011. Tuition that year was roughly $35,000. If you take the cost per student as Charlestonâs total cost, that means that Charlestonâs owners made about $14,000 for each student. These are estimates, of course, and any scholarship money would have to be subtracted. In 2012, roughly half the student body received a median scholarship of $6,000. Any way you cut it, though, itâs hardly âsaneâ for students. The complaints that InfiLaw operates schools of lower quality than Charleston seem overheated. In fact, InfiLawâs statistics for its students are largely comparable to Charlestonâs for tuition, salaries, jobs, low loan default rates and passage of the bar. Not only that, but InfiLaw has a track record of improving schools. After InfiLaw took overÂ FloridaÂ Coastal, the percentage of its students who passed the bar increased to 76.4 percent from 58.2 percent. Charlestonâs founders are contending that the school lacks the money to develop the technical and clinical expertise it needs and that InfiLaw is willing to provide it. So what explains the fierce opposition? One faculty member pinned it on the private equity issue inÂ an op-ed article in the local Charleston paper: âIs a private equity fund really the best entityâ to run the law school? But why is a for-profit private equity firm any worse than the current owners who have made tens of millions of dollars? There is also a movement to affiliate Charleston with the state-run College of Charleston. But even here, the affiliation was promoted by a state representative with an eye on the profit potential. Representative Stephen Goldfinch Jr., a member of South Carolinaâs Legislature,Â justified the allianceÂ by stating, âLaw schools are traditionally cash cows for statesâ and so government intervention was justified. With everyone looking to profit, the private equity accusation may be shorthand for a more real fear about the acquisition â that a private equity firm will lower standards. InfiLaw has a broader focus and appears much more willing to admit students with lower scores on the Law School Admission Test. Lost among the dispute is the fact that a lower-tier law school like Charleston â whoever owns it â can not only produce capable graduates but help students start careers they couldnât have without a law degree. As two Charleston alumniÂ wrote in an online op-edÂ in defense of InfiLaw, âUnder InfiLaw, we will be the same lawyers we are today. And will be proud graduates of a thriving law school rather than one that struggles to provide the technology and clinical-based education that is required today.â InfiLaw will not be Harvard, but for those who go in with open eyes, it may be a path to being a lawyer. The point is really to make sure that students know the costs and benefits before they matriculate so they can make a sound judgment about whether to attend. In other words, if InfiLaw or Charleston cannot provide an education that helps students obtain jobs, then presumably students will know and not attend. That is really what legal education these days is about at the regional law schools â perhaps they should just acknowledge that they canât be Harvard and provide students the training they need. The full commission is meeting on the InfiLaw petition on Thursday. Instead of arguing about who will profit from them, Charlestonâs students may instead want to ask who will give South Carolinaâs residents the best opportunity to succeed as lawyers at an acceptable price. Itâs probably something that would work well for all law schools these days.
