Updated, 5:53 p.m. | Jana Partners has already disclosed that it is one of the biggest shareholders in Hertz Global Holdings. Now, it’s urging the rental car service to pick its preferred candidate for the company’s chief executive spot. The activist hedge fund urged Hertz in a letter on Thursday to pick Scott Thompson, the former head of the Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group, a rival rental car provider that Hertz bought for $2.3 billion two years ago. Jana owns a roughly 7 percent stake. Hertz has been looking for a new chief since the resignation of Mark P. Frissora in early September, under pressure from investors. In an acknowledgment that the company was suing for peace with unhappy shareholders, it gave Carl C. Icahn, its biggest investor, the right to pick three directors for its board. Yet it appears that Jana isn’t happy with unresolved issues at the rental car company, notably the absence of a permanent leader. In its letter, the hedge fund argued that Mr. Thompson was the right person for that position, even if he was the man whom investors and analysts believe successfully induced Hertz into overpaying for Dollar Thrifty. “We fail to see, however, how Mr. Thompsonâs determined and successful efforts to deliver maximum value for his shareholders at Dollar Thrifty can be seen as anything other than an overwhelming positive; this quality is in fact exactly what Hertz shareholders want in a new C.E.O.,” Barry Rosenstein, the hedge fund’s managing partner, wrote.  The activist investor added that although Hertz may believe that Mr. Thompson has been campaigning for the position — a Bloomberg News article from August probably didn’t help — the hedge fund approached him about the position rather than the other way around. The hedge fund acknowledged that it had not met with all the potential candidates for the chief executive position. But it’s time to pick a new leader, the firm added. And absent a better choice, the job should go to Mr. Thompson. “It is possible that the board has identified a candidate who satisfies the criteria we have laid out even more fully than Mr. Thompson,” Mr. Rosenstein wrote. “If so, the board should appoint that person now. If not, it is time to appoint Mr. Thompson immediately.” Hertz said in a statement: âWe are aware of JANAâs filing, members of the Hertz board have been in dialogue with them, and we appreciate their views as we do for all of Hertz shareholders. Selecting a permanent C.E.O. is a top priority, and the board will take the time needed to identify the best candidate. The search process is being led by the boardâs search committee, which consists of five independent directors, including two recently appointed independent directors, with the assistance of an executive search firm. The Hertz board of directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all Hertz shareholders.â Advertisement
