A day after recalling 2.6 million vehicles globally, most of them in the United States, G.M. is recalling 218,000 Chevrolet Aveo cars from model years 2004 to 2008 in the United States. The problem with the cars stems from a faulty part in their daytime running lights that could overheat and cause a fire, according to documents filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. G.M. is recalling 214 Chevy Optra cars from the same model years that were sold in United States territories because of the same problem. Wednesdayâ€™s two recalls bring the number of vehicles affected by G.M. recalls this year to almost 13.8 million in the United States. That tops the previous full-year high of 10.7 million vehicles that the company recalled in the United States market in 2004. It pushes the number of vehicles that G.M. has recalled globally this year to more than 15.8 million.   Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
