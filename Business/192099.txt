From Matt Daily and Sarah McBride writing in the Green Column: The United States solar energy industry is having its best year ever, yet financing remains scarce for the billion-dollar projects needed for it to gain ground on global leaders like Germany. For the American solar sector to move up from rooftop add-on technology to the scale of fossil fuel power plants, the country needs to build large plants covering hundreds of acres. Each can cost as much as $1 billion, a huge sum for the nascent industry to finance, even with government incentives. âBecause the debt market is so thin right now, it is very difficult to find lenders who are able to lend long-term,â said Scott Frier, chief operating officer of Abengoa Solar, which has two big U.S. plants under development.
