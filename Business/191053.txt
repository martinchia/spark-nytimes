Pfizerâs courtship of AstraZeneca looks like a hate-hate relationship. In January, the British pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca viewed its  larger rivalâs takeover proposal of 46.61 pounds a share as too low on cash, too risky, and too cheap to even talk about. Pfizerâs latest proposal, an effort to get AstraZeneca to begin friendly talks, hasnât moved the needle much. Pfizer is now offering 50 pounds a share, 32 percent of which is in cash. Pfizer needs to find the right mix of cash and shares that allows it to preserve the tax benefits of relocating to Britain – which would require a minimum of 20 percent British ownership of the combined group – while not diluting itself too heavily with the share component of the bid. The latest proposal would leave the British ownership at 27 percent of the combined company, so thereâs still room to up the cash. The new price represents a mere 7 percent increase on the original offer â not a significant bump. True, it values AstraZeneca at a whopping 20 times forward earnings estimates, double the multiple it traded at a year ago.  Yet it seems cheap to those shareholders who see AstraZenecaâs turnaround as well advanced, and its potential cancer immunotherapy pipeline as a blockbuster in waiting. Citigroup estimates that AstraZeneca could be worth Â£49 a share on a stand-alone basis.  Pfizerâs share of the synergies and tax benefits could be worth nearly Â£2 a share, according to analysts at Berenberg. Some investors, who piled into the stock for its high income, will see the Â£50-a-share bid as an unexpected windfall. But others will be antagonized. AstraZenecaâs board seems to be listening to them, and has rejected the offer. Pfizerâs chief executive, Ian Read, seems to be having a little more luck in the second leg of his British charm offensive, an effort to get the government on side. Mr. Read said he would complete a research center in Cambridge, retain a manufacturing plant in Macclesfield and keep 20 percent of the groupâs research jobs in the country.  Britain’s science minister, David Willetts, gushed that Pfizer âhas come a long way.â Maybe someone should tell him that a five-year commitment, with few details, doesnât amount to much. AstraZeneca’s stock price of Â£48 a share is still implying perhaps an 80 percent chance of a bid at Â£52. It looks as if Mr. Read will have to further loosen the purse strings. Advertisement
