 Sony’s top executives will return their annual bonuses as the company’s electronics business struggles with losses, the Nikkei newspaper reported. About 40 executives involved with the electronics and headquarters operations will give up amounts equivalent to 30 to 35 percent of their annual pay as proposed by Kazuo Hirai, the chief executive, the paper said. The bonuses to be handed back could reach as much as 1 billion yen ($9.8 million). Sony is expected to report results for the year to March 31 on Wednesday. The company will also shift its focus to the 4K ultra high-definition LCD TVs, the daily reported. A version of this brief appears in print on May 13, 2014, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Top Executives at Sony to Return Bonuses.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
