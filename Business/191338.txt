Thanks to Mitt Romney, we know that corporations are people. But should that also mean that a big business gets to file lawsuits anonymously under the name of âCompany Doeâ? A coalition of consumer groups has asked a federal court to deny a companyâs bid to do just that, in a case that involves a new public database of potentially harmful products maintained by the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission. On Oct. 17, Company Doe filed a lawsuit against the product safety commission in the Federal District Court for the District of Maryland, according to the nonprofit advocacy group Public Citizen. The suit, Public Citizen says, seeks âto block the C.P.S.C. from posting on a publicly accessible database a consumerâs report of harm apparently caused by one of the companyâs products.â The database, which went live this spring, lets users search for reports of injuries caused by products like appliances, toys and baby furniture. It includes thousands of reports of injuries filed by consumers. Manufacturers can post responses online, and many do. By law, the commission must post consumer complaints within 20 days of receiving them; manufacturers are notified and given a chance to respond. If the complaint is shown to be untrue, it is supposed to be corrected or removed from the database. The creation of the database was fought by some child-product manufacturers, who sought action in Congress to water down the database. The details of the legal complaint remain unknown as yet, because the company asked the court to seal all proceedings in the case. If the court agrees, the companyâs name, the facts of the case and the legal arguments would not be made public, said Scott Michelman, a lawyer with Public Citizen. The case remains under seal for now, while the court considers the motion to have it permanentlyÂ  sealed. (A search by the case’s docket number on Pacer, the federal court records system, returns a response stating, “This case is sealed.”) Public Citizen and other consumer groups, including Consumers Union, have asked the court to deny the companyâs motion to seal the case. But because the entire case is under seal, the groupâs objection is also under seal, pending action by the judge. The case is officially titled Doe v. Tenenbaum (Inez Tenenbaum is the chairwoman of the product safety commission). A spokesman for the commission, Scott Wolfson, said in an e-mail that the agency intends to file a motion to have the case unsealed. The database, he said, represents a victory for consumers and âshould be the first stop for a consumer who has experienced an incident with a consumer product and needs to report it to the federal government.â The filing of a case by a Company Doe is âquite unusual,â said Mr. Michelman of Public Citizen. Typically, the use of John Doe or Jane Doe to shield a plaintiffâs identity is used only in cases where protecting an individualâs privacy is important â for instance, in the case of a minor. âUsually, you donât see companies litigating anonymously,â he said. Public Citizenâs position is that a challenge to a product safety law should not proceed in secret simply to allow a company to avoid âbad publicityâ about one of its products, he said. Do you think it’s reasonable to keep the name of the company secret?
