How small-business issues are shaping politics and policy. It has been more than three months since the comment period on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s proposed rules for equity crowdfunding ended, and with no sign of final regulations on the horizon, stakeholders are getting antsy.  The crowdfunding industry’s supporters are wondering when the agency, which was supposed to have those rules in place at the beginning of 2013, will finally let them begin selling stock in start-ups and emerging companies to average Americans. Consumer advocates, meanwhile, are worried that whenever it happens, it will be too soon. When the proposed rules first came out, last October, Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, was concerned with the balance between investor protection and access to capital struck by the commission, but she also allowed that regulators got some aspects of the rule right. Now, having dissected the 585-page rule, Ms. Roper said she is not so sure. “The proposed rules are terrible,” she said recently by email. She and other consumer advocates find fault with the S.E.C.’s approach on a range of investor protection issues but are particularly unhappy that the agency, as Ms. Roper put it, took “the most expansive approach possible” to the crowdfunding law’s limits on how much a person can invest in a year. “The S.E.C. proposal maximizes the risk of unaffordable losses because most companies will fail.” Notably, one of the crowdfunding legislation’s authors in the Senate, Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, also urged the S.E.C. to tighten the investment limits, which are based on income and net worth. “For small businesses to utilize it, the system must be both simple and easy,” he wrote. “Yet investors must also have confidence in what crowdfunding provides, or else they will not provide the capital into the market.”  I’ve been tracking the development of equity crowdfunding since the House and Senate passed very different versions of the legislation legalizing the industry, and I’ve been struck by how little heed the crowdfunding industry has paid to the second half of Mr. Merkley’s equation.  Back in those early, heady days of crowdfunding â that is, two years ago â the nascent industry’s boosters spoke a little dismissively about the risks crowdfunding posed to the crowd. After all, only half of all new enterprises stay in business for at least five years.  At a luncheon with a venture capital association in July 2012, I heard a Wall Street entrepreneur and crowdfunding industry organizer, Vince Molinari, try to imagine how the investor “acknowledgement of risk” form required by the law might read. His formulation: “You will lose your money before you invest if you crowdfund!” Almost two years later, the industry’s leaders can still seem dismissive of the risks â as I report in the May issue of Inc. magazine â but they tend to argue that completing a successful crowdfunding campaign is itself likely to make a company more successful, reducing the risk of investor losses. (Mr. Molinari, for his part, said recently that the long wait for final regulations from the S.E.C. has spurred the market to devise technological solutions to the problem of investor risk, in the form of filtering and other analytical tools. “I don’t think this process has been for naught,” he said, although it has engendered “lots of frustration,” he said.) As evidence ofÂ crowdfunding’s positive impact, industry leaders sometimes point to the performance of the Australian Small Scale Offerings Board, a crowdfunding listing service in that country. Doug Ellenoff, a New York securities lawyer, cited the crowdfunding site’s track record at Crowdfund Global Expo, an industry conference in San Diego in January.  “That site’s been in business for over five years, done about $150 million-ish in financings, and their failure rate â it’s a slightly different model than the U.S., in fairness â is 13 percent,” he told the audience. “So it’s legitimate and responsible to have concerns about all that’s new in this world, including crowdfunding, but there are referenceable examples worldwide where people have done things differently than they’ve been done here, like on the A.S.S.O.B. site, and I would encourage you to look there.” I did look there. In the two years since this claim about the Australian site’s success at nurturing crowdfunded companies first appeared in Forbes, it has shown up, among other places, in testimony before Congress, and in a report prepared for the World Bank â and it is usually misrepresented.  In reality, it is an accounting of the 176 businesses that raised money on the Australian site between 2008 and March 2012 â and of those businesses, all but 14 percent were still listed with Australia’s securities regulator at the end of that March. Fourteen percent is not quite as low as 13 percent, but it’s still a low number, and the number of failing businesses could actually be even lower, because delisting does not necessarily mean the company is defunct (it could have been acquired or taken private, for example). But as a measure of a crowdfunded company’s long-term success, this aggregate figure is almost meaningless, because it includes many businesses that had raised money recently and had not yet had time to fail. When the sample is limited to the 25 businesses that raised money in 2008, the picture is bleaker: Fourteen of those businesses, or 56 percent, are no longer listed today, according to Paul Niederer, the Offerings Board’s chief executive. In theory, successful crowdfunding should improve a business’s odds. If nothing else, it suggests that the company at least has fans, if not customers. Moreover, according to D.J. Paul, another industry organizer who spoke at the San Diego conference, the two leading reasons for those failures are lack of money and lack of expertise. Crowdfunding, Mr. Paul told the audience, ought to solve both problems. “It should make access to capital easier; that is one of the designs of the legislation in the first place,” he said. And, he added, “we can hope that as a result of putting your venture out in a public forum that people perhaps might invest with you because they have some expertise in the thing that you’re doing. So perhaps some of the expertise of the crowd, of the investors, will actually influence the founders such that the failure rate will go down.” Perhaps. But in the absence of other evidence, Mr. Paul is right that it is only a hope. And it is not likely to win over the investor advocates who fear the agency got the balance wrong, like Ms. Roper and the law’s author, Mr. Merkley.
