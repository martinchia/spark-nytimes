Under rising scrutiny for its ties to Wall Street, the Federal Reserve played defense in separate Senate panels on Friday. On the fifth floor of the Dirksen building, Senator Sherrod Brown grilled William C. Dudley, the president of the New York Fed, on whether regulators are too close to the banks they regulate. On Thursday, the Fed announced that it would study its Wall Street oversight. That announcement came after DealBook reported that a banker at Goldman Sachs received confidential documents from a former colleague at the New York Fed. Senator Elizabeth Warren wondered if Mr. Dudley would compare the New York Fed to a cop walking a beat. âIt is not like cop on the beat,â Mr. Dudley said. âItâs more like a fire warden.â Senator Warren questioned the leadership of the cop fire warden Mr. Dudley. âIs there a culture problem at the New York Fed?â asked Ms. Warren. âI think the evidence says that there is. You need to fix it, Mr. Dudley, or we need to get someone who will.â Meanwhile, on the first floor of Dirksen, senators continued to assail Wall Street’s outsize role in commodities. Daniel K. Tarullo, a Fed governor, said that the Fed was considering new limits for banks in the commodities markets. Senator Carl Levin, fresh off taking Goldman to task, called the “rule-making long overdue.” A look back on our reporting of the past week’s highs and lows in finance.
