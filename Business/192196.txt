Glencore, the world’s largest commodities trader, could eventually merge with  the mining company Xstrata, according to an HSBC research note published this week. If such a deal materialized, the combined entity could be worth more than $100 billion. Glencore, the largest Xstrata shareholder with a 34 percent stake, has been preparing itself for an initial public offering that could value the company at up to $60 billion. Last month, Xstrataâs chief executive, Mick Davis, said it was “unsustainable in the longer term” to have the two companies listed separately. Given the situation, Andrew Keen, an analyst at HSBC, assessed what a Glencore initial offering could mean for Xstrata. He called Glencoreâs potential offering “Xstrataâs core controversy in the near term,” because “the process of the market reaching a valuation of Glencore is likely to focus attention on the underlying value” of the mining company.  “The potential for some kind of transaction between the two entities to form one is likely to be an ongoing focus for investors,” Mr. Keen wrote in a note published on Monday. Last summer, analysts estimated that Glencore was worth $47 billion. But the company’s valuation has surged along with the price of the mining stocks it owns. Shares of Xstrata, which has a market capitalization of Â£41.7 billion ($67.4 billion), are up more than 50 percent since last July. Glencore has been playing it coy with its initial public offering. It has postponed an official decision even as it has briefed analysts on the workings of its business. The company reported net income of $3.8 billion for 2010, up 40 percent from the previous year. Last month, Xstrata reported profit of $5.15 billion for 2010, up 86 percent from 2009. One advantage Glencore anticipates from the potential offering, a person familiar with the company said, is that it would have more flexibility to finance larger acquisitions with its own shares. The merger speculation comes as Xstrata said on Monday that Sir John Bond had been named to succeed Willy Strothotte as chairman.  Mr. Strothotte is also chairman of Glencore, and the move is one of many boardroom changes that the company’s I.P.O. plans have set in motion. Xstrata has said “it would not be appropriate for the two companies to have the same chairman.” Advertisement
