Generating revenue along with the buzz. Iâm one of the many people in the United States who have had their individual health insurance policy canceled since the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act began Oct. 1. I own the Quintessence Group, a marketing consulting company based in Philadelphia. I have seven employees, but Iâve dodged the staff health insurance bullet for years because all of my employees have either had insurance through their spouses or have worked as independent contractors. I offered a group health insurance plan through the company until 2007, when I reorganized. I finally decided to offer health insurance again in the summer of 2012 â after my divorce became final and I had to get an individual policy. The process was not easy, even though I was 39 and in good health. I applied to Aetna, where I had been covered on my ex-husbandâs policy, but was denied. The company pulled the results of a blood test during the underwriting process and decided a blood cholesterol score of 213 disqualified me. (The Mayo Clinic says that a score below 200 is desirable.) What they didnât know is that I was on a medication before the test that has a side effect of elevating cholesterol. So this forced me to apply for the only other health insurance option in my market, Independence Blue Cross, which was happy to sell me a premium individual PPO policy for $447 a month. Four months later, after my 40th birthday, my premium was raised to $618 a month, which I thought was pretty expensive. With this insurance policy, I had $50 co-pays for regular doctor visits and experienced quite a bit of gap billing for lab work and minor in-office procedures. And, by the way, the policy did not include either dental or vision coverage. And then, in October, I got a letter informing me that my policy would be discontinued effective Jan. 1. Now I am panicked and irritated â but also hopeful that I can get a reasonably priced policy, through the Affordable Care Act, that wonât discriminate against my slightly elevated cholesterol, my race, my gender or any other preexisting condition. I have not yet decided if my health insurance options would be better served offering group health insurance again or just getting another individual policy. As my research progresses, I will chronicle my journey to get a new policy. My first stop is HealthCare.gov. Iâm also going to reach out to a health insurance broker for advice. I may find that itâs more beneficial to make one of my contractors an employee and get a group plan instead. You must have at least two employees to apply for health insurance to qualify for a group plan. Has the Affordable Care Act had an impact on your business? Melinda F.
