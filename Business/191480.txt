8:39 p.m. | Updated  A federal bankruptcy judge on Tuesday blessed a plan by Lehman Brothersâ bankruptcy estate to pay out about $65 billionto creditors, about one-fifth of what they are owed, a major step toward winding down the investment bank. The approval by Judge James M. Peck of the federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan, who has overseen Lehmanâs case, paves the way for a vote by creditors sometime this fall. That could lead to Lehmanâs ending its bankruptcy and paying off creditors as soon as early next year â some three years after its Chapter 11 filing touched off a global financial crisis and reshaped banking. Since the Sept. 15, 2008 filing, Lehmanâs estate has sold off significant portions of the firmâs business and assets, seeking to recover some money for scores of institutions around the world. Lehman, saddled with bad real estate assets, filed in 2008 with about $613 billion in debt. But the bankruptcy case continually whittled the amount of allowable claims down to about $320 billion. The proposed payout plan will offer creditors an average recovery of about 20 cents on the dollar â higher than estimates of 17 to 18 cents on the dollar from earlier this year. The labyrinthine disclosure statement being considered on Tuesday â months in the making â followed clashes between Lehman and its debtholders and other institutions owed billions of dollars. Lehman revised the scheme several times in order to earn the support of several major creditors, including Goldman Sachs and the hedge funds Elliott Management and Paulson & Company. âThereâs so much money involved and so many viewpoints,â said Evan D. Flaschen, chairman of the financial restructuring practice at the law firm of Bracewell & Giuliani, who compared the Lehman proceedings with other contentious bankruptcies like that of the Tribune Company. âFor all of them to reach common ground really is momentous.â Lehmanâs disclosure statement for the plan will be sent to the estateâs 110,000 creditors, who will have until Nov. 4 to vote. To pass, the plan must win approval from a majority of creditors in each class, and voters in favor of the plan must represent at least two-thirds of the dollar amount sought. A confirmation hearing is scheduled for Dec. 6, pending approval by creditors. Lehman has said that it hopes to begin paying creditors by early next year. In Wall Streetâs mind, Lehman Brothers ceased to exist when it agreed to sell its North American operations to Barclays Capital on Sept. 16, 2008, the day after it filed for bankruptcy. But the complex unwinding of Lehmanâs remaining assets has proved to be an extraordinary boon for lawyers and advisers involved in the case. A recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that Lehman Brothers Holdings had paid nearly $1.4 billion in legal and advisory fees in connection with its bankruptcy through July, making it the most expensive bankruptcy in history. Weil, Gotshal & Manges, the law firm representing Lehman, has alone collected more than $300 million in fees. Final revisions to the crucial disclosure statement came in as late as Tuesday morning, when lawyers for Wells Fargo agreed to drop objections to the plan. But other creditors, including Germanyâs Bundesbank and the hedge fund Centerbridge Partners, still had objections. Judge Peck overruled those objections for now, saying that they would be heard in the confirmation hearing. The hearing on Tuesday, held in a sixth-floor courtroom so packed that it required opening two adjacent overflow rooms, lasted several hours, and included remarks from lawyers representing Lehman creditors who stated their objections to the proposed payment plan and, often, emphasized the size of their claims. One lawyer for Bundesbank likened the proceedings to Lake Wobegon, Garrison Keillorâs fictional Minnesota town, where âall the women are strong, all the men are good-looking, and all the children are above average.â âEveryoneâs claims are a little larger than normal,â the lawyer said. Harvey R. Miller, the lead lawyer for Lehmanâs estate, said he hoped Tuesdayâs hearing would represent âthe beginning of the endâ of Lehmanâs bankruptcy. Judge Peck called the disclosure agreementâs approval âan extraordinary and noble achievement,â and said that the lawyers on both sides had done work that âborders on miraculousâ by bringing major groups of creditors into agreement on a plan.
