Okapi Partners has gained prominence in recent years for its role in advising activist investors like Elliott Management and Starboard Value in their fights against companies like the Hess Corporation and Darden Restaurants, the parent of Olive Garden. But the firm is hiring a new senior executive to help bolster its work for corporate clients. The firm, a proxy solicitor that dispenses advice on matters involving shareholder votes like board elections and mergers, plans to announce on Friday that it has hired Tony Vecchio from Georgeson, a rival firm, as a managing director. It’s the latest hiring by the firm as it seeks to battle more-established competitors. In recent years, the proxy solicitation industry has benefited from an increase in shareholder activism, where hedge funds and other investors push for change at companies by contesting director seats or threatening to vote against an acquisition. That kind of boardroom brawling is expected to increase even more next year. But Okapi actually spends more of its time advising corporations, in the defense against activist campaigns and in more mundane matters, according to Bruce H. Goldfarb, the firm’s chief executive. Adding Mr. Vecchio — whom he knew from his days working at Georgeson — is meant to help bring in more senior experience on that front. “The way we look at the service we provide is that we help our clients communicate with investors,” Mr. Goldfarb said in a telephone interview. “Our clients are both corporations and activists, as well as mutual funds and other institutional investors.” That said, Okapi expects to be busy yet again on the activist front. Many hedge funds and other dissident shareholders are already contacting potential fight targets ahead of a wave of deadlines for nominating board members. And companies are becoming more interested and focused on both understanding who their investors are and how best to communicate with them.  “Itâs an environment thatâs heating up,” Mr. Goldfarb said. “Right now, people are boiling the water in their tea kettle of activism. The whistles will be ready to go off.” Advertisement
