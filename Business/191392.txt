5:02 p.m. | Updated  ConAgra Foods said on Monday that it was dropping its $94-a-share cash offer for Ralcorp Holdings.  “This follows Ralcorpâs failure to enter into a constructive dialogue with ConAgra Foods,” the company said in a statement.  Earlier on Monday, Ralcorp said that it still considered ConAgra‘s $5.2 billion takeover offer insufficient. That all but ensured that the offer would expire without deal talks beginning. Ralcorp said in a statement that its board had met to again consider ConAgra’s $94-a-share offer, which is higher than the company had ever traded. But Ralcorp’s directors again decided that the bid would generate less value than the company’s plan of spinning off Post Foods, the maker of Grape-Nuts and Cocoa Pebbles cereals. ConAgra’s bid was set to expire at 5 p.m. on Monday. Among the Ralcorp board’s concerns were that ConAgra’s bid offered a lower premium than other food deals, according to a person briefed on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. This person added that the directors felt that ConAgra was limited in how much it could raise its offer and still maintain an investment-grade rating. Shares of Ralcorp ended the day down 1.6 percent, at $75.25. Shares of ConAgra fell 2.3 percent, to $23.39. Advertisement
