Deutsche Postbank, the German retail lender, recommended on Wednesday that its shareholders accept a takeover offer from Deutsche Bank, The Associated Press reported. Deutsche Bank, the country’s biggest lender, announced plans last month for a full takeover of Deutsche Postbank, of which it already holds nearly 30 percent. It offered 25 euros ($34.61) a share for an estimated total cost of 6.3 billion euros. â a cash payment matching the volume-weighted average price over the previous three months. Deutsche Postbank said its management and supervisory boards had concluded that the price was “appropriate” and were recommending that shareholders accept the offer. It said it welcomed Deutsche Bank’s pledge to maintain Deutsche Postbank as a separate company and brand. Deutsche Bank’s chief executive, Josef Ackermann, has said the takeover would allow Deutsche Bank to expand its position in Germany and in the retail banking business, and to improve its revenue mix.
