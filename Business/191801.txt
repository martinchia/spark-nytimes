Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Permira said on Wednesday that they were selling about 3.7 percent of ProSiebenSat.1 Media, the German broadcaster. ProSieben shares slipped 0.21 euros, or 0.86 percent, to 24.25 euros on Thursday, making the transaction worth around 194 million euros ($255 million). Proceeds from the sale of eight million preferred shares will be used to reduce debt and raise liquidity for Lavena Holding 5, the company through which K.K.R. and Permira own the ProSieben stake. The companies said in a joint statement that they would immediately begin book-building. Once the sale is completed, the two private equity firms will still hold 53 percent of ProSiebenâs equity, and 88 percent of the voting shares. The two firms announced their takeover of ProSieben — the biggest broadcaster in Germany, Europe’s largest economy — in 2006, paying 22.40 euros a preferred share.   Advertisement
