Two founders of Groupon, Brad Keywell and Eric Lefkofsky, have invested $1 million in the Silicon Valley start-up Qwiki through their investment fund, Lightbank, extending Qwiki’s latest fund-raising round to about $9 million. “We believe that the Qwiki platform is unique and valuable in many respects, and look forward to helping the management team identify the most promising opportunities,” Mr. Keywell wrote in an e-mail to DealBook. Qwiki — started by Dr. Louis Monier, a founder of AltaVista, and Doug Imbruce — is a technology platform that uses data to create multimedia presentations. The company currently offers a free, Wikipedia-like service that responds to search queries with brief audiovisual packages. It will soon push its service across multiple mobile devices, including the iPad and iTV, and it plans eventually to open its platform to third party users like content publishers or small businesses. “Qwiki solves the problem of declining relevancy for traditional content as users migrate toward rich media as their default method for consuming information,” Mr. Keywell said. “Qwikiâs solution becomes especially important as media consumption moves off the desktop and onto mobile devices, an area we’ve been particularly focused on.” Since its introduction in September, Qwiki has attracted more than a dozen investors, Mr. Imbuce said. The latest round was led by Eduardo Saverin, the Facebook co-founder whose lawsuit against Mark Zuckerberg was portrayed in the film “The Social Network.” A YouTube co-founder, Jawed Karim, and a Juniper Networks co-founder, Pradeep Sindhu, are also investors in Qwiki, which is based in San Francisco and has raised a total of $10.5 million from investors, including seed capital. Mr. Keywell and Mr. Lefkofsky, who both attended the University of Michigan as undergraduates and law students, are serial entrepreneurs. Before starting Lightbank, they co-founded MediaBank, an analytics platform; Echo Global Logistics; and Groupon, which they co-founded with Andrew Mason, its chief executive.  Although Mr. Keywell and Mr. Lefkofsky are less active in Groupon on a day-to-day basis, the pair were close advisers to Mr. Mason, who has expanded the company from a handful ofÂ  employees to more than 5,900 in less than three years. Part of the reason why Qwiki was so attractive to the low-profile co-founders of Groupon, according to Mr. Keywell, was its “encouraging rate of user adoption.” Earlier this year, Mr. Keywell invited Mr. Imbruce and his team to Groupon’s headquarters in Chicago, where they toured the office and discussed a possible investment opportunity. As with Groupon, Mr. Keywell hopes his expertise in building big companies, quickly, will be a valuable asset for the fledgling Qwiki. “We invested in Qwiki on its own merits, and on our evaluation of its own unique prospects, not in relation to any other company,” Mr. Keywell said. “I think Qwiki can specifically benefit from our vertical expertise and ability to accelerate to scale.” Advertisement
