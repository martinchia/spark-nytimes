Coming off strong returns, John Paulson, in his 2010 year-end letter to investors, tracks the next phase for several large bets at his firm, Paulson & Company, which famously profited from the subprime mortgage crisis.  Now, he’s making money on the recovery. His Citigroup holdings, which he started amassing in the middle of 2009, are up about $1 billion so far. The bank was the firm’s most profitable bet of 2010. Mr. Paulson, who manages nearly $35 billion in assets across a wide array of strategies, took heat from investors and others who claimed his funds were too big to manage effectively. With his flagship fund flat as 2010 drew to a close, the chorus of critics only got louder. Then his Advantage Fund roared back, returning about 17 percent on the year thanks to a blockbuster December. His Recovery Fund, which included the Citigroup stake, gained 24 percent in 2010. The returns were even better for those in the gold share class, which also gives investors exposure to the precious metal.  In short, Mr. Paulson wants investors to know he’s still got the Midas touch.  âIn addition to maneuvering our investment strategy based on where we are in the economic cycle, a large part of our success has been based on anticipating market events before they are generally recognized,â he wrote in the letter. In the letter, Mr. Paulson offers insight into that self-proclaimed foresight. He points out that investing is a matter of timing, and that certain market conditions merit certain strategies.  The graphic breaks down two elements of his strategy: implementation and monetization. For instance, he began implementing his famous short position on credit in 2005 and started his subprime fund in 2006. The monetization phase followed through 2008 as the housing bubble burst. Looking to the future, he charts his inflation hedges. It’s no secret Mr. Paulson is long on gold. As such, his funds began to implement inflation hedges, like gold, in 2009. But he doesn’t expect the various bets to be monetized fully until 2013 or 2014, even though those investments performed pretty well as gold prices soared. He’s also betting on an uptick in mergers and acquisitions. He’s started laying out related positions in 2010 and expects them to pay off sometime in 2014, according to the letter. Basically, he’s bullish on the United States economy. âWe believe the U.S. economy is recovering, and we anticipate continued growth,â he wrote. Advertisement
