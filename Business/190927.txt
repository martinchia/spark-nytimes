 OTTAWA — The Toronto-Dominion Bank signaled on Thursday that Ed Clark, who turned it into Canadaâs dominant retail bank before starting a successful foray into the United States, will gradually move out of the position of president and chief executive beginning next year.  In a speech prepared for the companyâs annual meeting on Thursday, which will be held simultaneously in New York and Toronto, Brian Levitt, the bankâs chairman, said that after Mr. Clarkâs current contract expires in April 2013, he will continue as chief executive only through âan open-ended employment agreement.â Exactly how long that will continue is unclear. But both Mr. Levitt and Mr. Clark suggested that any change was unlikely to come quickly. âAt some point Ed will retire but he plans to be around for a while yet,â Mr. Levitt said. âThe board is confident that Edâs successor will be internal and will carry on with the same vision and values.â Mr. Clark, who led the New York side of the presentation, that after next year, the bank can ask him to leave at any time without making a severance payment. He added that although he turns 65 next year, he doesnât anticipate being quickly replaced. âIâm in no hurry, Iâve got a fantastic job,â he said. âBut I also think thereâs a point at which I have to move on.â While Canadaâs five large banks dominate financial services in their home country and all enjoy stable financial performance, even during economic downturns, most of them have been unable to translate that success into expansion into the United States.  Under Mr. Clark, however, Toronto-Dominion has found success in the United States. He applied the same formula of high levels of customer service that also turned Toronto-Dominion into the leader in its home market. Until now, Toronto-Dominion has grown in the United States through acquisitions including its $8.6 billion purchase of Commerce Bancorp of New Jersey in 2008 as well as its acquisition of Chrysler Financial, which is now called TD Auto Finance. On Thursday, however, Mr. Clark said the bank would invest directly in opening 50 to 60 new branches in New York, with the goal of becoming the cityâs third-largest retail banker based on deposits within four years. Mr. Clark said it currently ranked fifth. He estimated that opening the branches would require an investment of âa couple of hundred of millions.â While a stable real estate market with potential for high quality mortgage lending is one of the features Mr. Clark finds attractive about New York, he said that the marketâs sheer size is its chief attraction. âThe greater New York City area has a deposit base three quarters the size of all of Canada,â he said.  Mr. Clark said the United States economy was displaying some âsigns of life.â He cautioned that although the bank did not expect to âsee a snap back recovery, we may well see a consistent steady recovery, as well as, hopefully, paced structural reforms to deal with the critical underlying issues.â Mr. Clark noted that Toronto-Dominionâs continued strong financial performance stemmed in large part from its conservative management style, which avoided subprime mortgage lending in the United States and other risky investments.  âIf something seems too good to be true, it probably is and we wonât do it or sell it,â he said. âWeâll walk away from opportunities.â  While not cited by Mr. Clark, the lack of a housing bubble and corresponding credit crisis in Canada also shielded all of Canadaâs banks from a downturn.
