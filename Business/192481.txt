The fiscal impasse in Congress has been testing investorsâ confidence that the United States â considered the most reliable borrower in the world â will be able to pay back its debt on time, Nathaniel Popper reports in DealBook. Investors in recent days have shifted money out of the $1.7 trillion market for the short-term government debt known as Treasury bills. It now costs more for the United States to borrow money for a month than it does for the average highly rated American company to do so, Mr. Popper writes. âThese bills are like the center of gravity for the financial universe â they really are,â said Lee A. Sachs, a former Treasury official who now runs the lending firm Alliance Partners. âDefaulting on these would be like the laws of physics being repealed.â But the most visible stock market is remaining relatively calm â making a crisis more likely, Jesse Eisinger of ProPublica writes in his column, The Trade. âWall Streetâs lack of worry reflects cynicism about Washington (who doesnât feel that?) but also a deep misreading of how significant the ideological fissures are in the capital,â Mr. Eisinger writes. âWall Street is misunderstanding the extremism of the House Tea Party Republicans who precipitated the government shutdown and debt ceiling crisis.â As a result of the standoff, some influential business executives have come to a conclusion that recently would have been unthinkable: Their voices are carrying little weight with the House majority that their campaign contributions helped build, Eric Lipton, Nicholas Confessore and Nelson D. Schwartz report in The New York Times. âTheir frustration has grown so intense in recent days that several trade association officials warned in interviews on Wednesday that they were considering helping wage primary campaigns against Republican lawmakers who had worked to engineer the political standoff in Washington.â And yet, House Republicans began on Wednesday to consider a path out of the fiscal impasse that would raise the debt ceiling for a few weeks as they press for a broader deficit reduction deal, Jonathan Weisman reports in The Times. âThat approach could possibly set aside the fight over the new health care law, which prompted the shutdown and which some Republicans will be reluctant to abandon.â  WHAT TO EXPECT FROM YELLEN AT THE FED Â |Â Janet L. Yellen, President Obamaâs nominee to succeed the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, at the end of January, has pressed for stronger measures to reduce unemployment as the central bankâs vice chair since 2010, Binyamin Appelbaum reports in The New York Times. âMs. Yellenâs intellectual roots and leadership style both suggest that she would push somewhat more forcefully than Mr. Bernanke to extend the Fedâs stimulus campaign, according to a careful review of her career and interviews with more than two dozen colleagues and acquaintances.â âShe has expressed greater concern about the economic consequences of unemployment, a stronger conviction in the Fedâs ability to stimulate job growth and a greater willingness to tolerate a little more inflation in order to reduce unemployment more quickly. Until recently, her emphasis on unemployment would likely have disqualified her for the job, and it has already inspired opposition from some Senate Republicans and investors concerned that she would not be sufficiently vigilant in guarding against inflation,â Mr. Appelbaum reports. “Ms. Yellen is also a more assertive leader than Mr. Bernanke and appears less averse to conflict. While both encourage open debate and seek to make decisions by consensus, Ms. Yellen has been a more vocal and persistent advocate for her own views. Mr. Bernanke has allowed Fed officials to air their views freely, while Ms. Yellen has expressed concern that the cacophony undermines the Fedâs effectiveness by sowing confusion about the direction of policy.â  ON THE AGENDA Â |Â  Jacob J.
