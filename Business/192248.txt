LONDON â Greene King, a British brewer and operator of pubs and hotels, said on Tuesday that it had reached an agreement on a recommended offer to acquire the Spirit Pub Company of Britain. According to the offer, Greene King, which makes Old Speckled Hen and Greene King I.P.A., would pay 773.6 million pounds, or about $1.2 billion, in cash and stock for Spirit. The deal would value Spirit at Â£1.15 a share, 52 percent above its closing price in September before Greene Kingâs initial overture to Spirit was made public. Spiritâs board of directors intends to unanimously recommend that shareholders approve the offer, the companies said in a news release. Last week, Spiritâs board agreed to continue negotiations and to extend Greene King’s window to make a final offer to Tuesday. The offer is conditional, in part, on the approval of shareholders who have at least 75 percent of Spiritâs stock. The transaction must also be approved by Greene King’s shareholders and regulators. Under the deal, Spirit shareholders would receive 0.1322 of a share in the combined company and 8 pence in cash for each share of Spirit they own. After the transaction, Spirit shareholders would own almost 29 percent of the combined company. Greene King said it believed it could achieve cost savings of at least Â£30 million a year after the deal. Greene King, based in Bury St. Edmunds, England, operates about 1,900 pubs, restaurants and hotels in Britain. The company, founded by Benjamin Greene, has been brewing beer since 1799. It posted revenue of Â£1.3 billion for its 2014 fiscal year, which ended in May. Spirit, which was spun off from Punch Taverns in 2011, operates about 1,200 pubs in Britain. It posted profit of Â£42 million on revenue of Â£758 million in the 2013 fiscal year. Shares of Spirit rose 1.6 percent, to Â£1.09, in midday trading in London on Tuesday, while shares of Greene King declined 2.7 percent, to Â£7.86. Advertisement
