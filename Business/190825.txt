Credit Suisse is expanding its metal and mining advisory business, hiring a new executive as part of an effort to capture more fees in the sector. The Swiss bank is adding David Hammond, a longtime Morgan Stanley banker, as its global head of metal and mining advisory, according to an internal memo obtained by DealBook. Mr. Hammond, who will be based in London, plans to join the bank in October. At Morgan Stanley, where he spent his entire career, Mr. Hammond advised Barrick Gold on its $7.8 billion takeover of Equinox Minerals last year. In 2007, he represented Phelps Dodge in its $26 billion merger with Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold. âDavid has the senior client relationships, global expertise and leadership abilities that will allow us to accelerate our buildout in this critical industry segment,â according to the memo, which was signed by Mark Echlin and Andy Lipsky, co-heads of Credit Suisseâs global industrial group.  A spokesman for Credit Suisse confirmed the memoâs contents. Mr. Hammond started at Morgan Stanley in 1997, after earning a joint law and business degree from New York University. Advertisement
