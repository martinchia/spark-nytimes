Mark Oesterle, the chief counsel to Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee, has joined Reed Smith’s financial regulatory group in the law firmâs Washington office.  Mr. Oesterle will be âof counselâ to the firm, which has some 220 lawyers representing banks and other financial institutions across the world.  After playing an important role in crafting the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, Mr. Oesterle will now influence the law’s implementation as an outsider.  With banks facing hundreds of new regulations related to Dodd-Frank, their lawyers have been frantically drafting letters to government regulators who are implementing the law. The goal is to influence regulatory agencies as they determine the final outcome of Dodd-Frank.  Mr. Oesterleâs inside-Washington experience gives him plenty of influence to wield. In a statement, the firm noted that Mr. Oesterle had worked with financial regulators âwhile developing such legislation and throughout the regulatory implementation process that follows legislative enactment.â âMark has an impressive command of every topic addressed by the Dodd-Frank banking legislation and its impact on the financial services industry,â Leonard A. Bernstein, head of Reed Smithâs financial regulatory group, said in the statement. Mr. Bernstein added that âhaving Mark on board to help steward our clients through this process will be a tremendous asset.â  Mr. Oesterle will join a group that is heavy on Wall Street experience. Several of his new colleagues are former lawyers at big banks, including the former general counsel at the Bank of New York Mellon and the former vice chairman of PNC. âReed Smith has a group of unique attorneys, many of whom have served major financial institutions at the highest levels,â Mr. Oesterle said in the statement. Mr. Oesterle had been with the Senate Banking Committee since 2001. He had been the chief counsel, Republican deputy chief of staff and Parliamentarian. Mr. Oesterle started his career on Capitol Hill as a legislative aide to Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama, who is the ranking member of the banking committee.  Advertisement
