The private equity firm Silver Lake has agreed to pay $29.5 million to settle accusations that it colluded with its rivals to drive down the prices of corporate takeovers before the financial crisis, according to a court filing on Thursday.  Silver Lake is the third defendant to settle accusations in the nearly seven-year-old lawsuit filed by former shareholders of the acquired companies, who contend that a group of private equityâs top firms were unofficial partners in an illegal conspiracy to reduce competition. In striking the deal, Silver Lake continued to dispute the accusations, according to the filing in Federal District Court in Massachusetts.  The previous two defendants to settle, Goldman Sachs and Bain Capital, agreed to pay a combined $121 million. Barring any further deals, the remaining defendants — the Blackstone Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, TPG Capital and the Carlyle Group — are scheduled to head to trial in November. Silver Lake was a smaller player than the other firms, involved in relatively few of the deals under scrutiny. In a pillar of its defense strategy in the case, the firm said that contracts with its investors prevented it from buying any companies outside the field of technology, making any overarching collusion unlikely. But in weighing the potential costs of a trial, the firm chose to settle, a spokeswoman said. The settlement is pending approval by the court. “While we continue to believe that the plaintiffs’ claims about Silver Lake are baseless and without merit, we concluded that it was in the best interests of our limited partners to put this matter behind us and end over six years of litigation, expense and distraction,â the Silver Lake spokeswoman, Gemma Hart, said in a statement. A lawyer for the plaintiffs, K. Craig Wildfang, indicated that the lower tab in the Silver Lake settlement could be explained in part by the firmâs unique defense. âWe take all factors into account when deciding whether to settle with a defendant and how much to settle for,â Mr. Wildfang said. “Silver Lakeâs unique set of facts, including their limitation in investing in only technology companies, was something we thought we should take account of.â The lawsuit focused on string of deals during a heady period for the private equity industry, when firms would often team up to place enormous bets. Among those deals was the buyout of SunGard Data Systems, which Silver Lake and a number of other firms acquired for $10.4 billion in 2005. Such transactions, known as âclub deals,â helped foster a quid pro quo understanding among the firms, according to the lawsuit. In one message quoted in the complaint, Glenn H. Hutchins, a co-founder of Silver Lake, wrote to Hamilton E. James, the president of Blackstone: âWe believe, perhaps mistakenly, that we invited you into SunGard and have a reasonable expectation of your reciprocating.â “You are one of the very few firms in the SunGard consortium who hasn’t found an opportunity to invite us into something that we weren’t otherwise engaged with,â Mr. Hutchins continued, according to the lawsuit. “It has caused me to wonder if you and I have different views on that subject or if there is something I am missing.” Advertisement
