An Australian regulatory panel has declined to move forward on claims that Foster’s made “misleading and deceptive” statements in its full-year financial results, a charge lobbed by SABMiller in its hostile takeover battle. SABMiller, which took its $10 billion bid directly to shareholders after being rebuffed by the Foster’s board, asked the Australian government’s Takeovers Panel this month to look into the company’s accounting, notably its financial objectives and pro forma net debt. “SABMiller submits that these statements do not meet the standards required in statements made in the context of a takeover bid and are misleading and deceptive,” the panel outlined in a statement at the time.  But the Australian authorities have decided not to “conduct proceedings” on the matter, finding no problems with Foster’s forward-looking statements. The regulator did raise some issues with the company’s net debt figures, but those concerns “were allayed” as Foster’s agreed to clarify the underlying calculations, the panel said in a statement on Thursday.  The takeover battle between SABMiller and Foster’s has intensified in recent weeks.  In June, SABMiller offered $10 billion for Foster’s, a bid its board quickly rejected as too low. With the directors maintaining their stance, SABMiller took the deal to Foster’s shareholders in August.  At the time, Foster’s reiterated its position that the deal “significantly undervalues the company” As part of its effort to thwart the hostile bid, Foster’s agreed to return at least $525 million to investors, possibly through a share buyback. Shares of Foster’s are trading at 4.85 Australia dollars, slightly below SABMiller’s offer of 4.90 dollars a share.  Advertisement
