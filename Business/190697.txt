SUN VALLEY, Idaho — At the Allen & Company media and technology conference here, the name of the game is talk. Mainly, who’s talking with whom?   Stocked with moguls galore, the gathering is best known for the deals that have emerged from hush-hush meetings that take place by this resort’s duck pond or in conference rooms at the Sun Valley Inn. Chief among those enshrined in conference lore was the merger of Disney and Capital Cities. But a number of attendees played down the importance of deals hatched at the conference. (That said, John C. Malone, who has reiterated here the need for consolidation in the cable industry, hustled to at least one meeting on Thursday morning.) Instead, coming to the Allen & Company conference largely allows moguls to see peers and discuss the state of their industries, as well as meet with potential new business partners. With that in mind, here are a few intriguing conversation partners that DealBook has observed so far: Advertisement
