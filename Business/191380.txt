SHANGHAI â Shares of the Chinese gaming and Internet giant Shanda Interactive soared early Monday after the company announced a management-led buyout that would take the Nasdaq-listed company private. The management group includes Shanda’s founder and chief executive, Chen Tianqiao, his wife Luo Qianqian, who is a nonexecutive director of the company, and Mr. Chen’s brother, Chen Danian, a Shanda director and the company’s chief operating officer. The group already controls about 68.4 percent of the company.  The buyout group offered to pay $41.35 a share to acquire the remaining 31.6 percent of the company it did not already own. The proposal, worth an estimated $740 million, represents a 24 percent premium to the stock’s closing price on Friday. Shanghai-based Shanda Interactive is one of this country’s best-known gaming and entertainment companies. But since its spectacular Nasdaq debut in 2005, the company has gone through a complicated series of restructuring efforts, spinoffs and acquisitions. In 2009, its gaming unit, which provides the bulk of its revenue and earnings, was spun off in an initial public offering that raised $1 billion on Nasdaq. It was one of the biggest United States I.P.O.’s in 2009. As much as 77 percent of Shanda Interactive’s revenue now comes from the gaming unit, according to Morgan Stanley. That unit charges fees for online gamers to play massively multiplayer online role-playing games. The company has also moved into online literature, video and entertainment, trying to create a Disney-like conglomerate. It has also spent heavily to acquire companies and assets, including $80 million early last year to buy a United States online game distributor, Mochi Media. But analysts have complained about the parent company’s transparency and have expressed doubts about whether its nongaming units can develop into something significant. Also, Shanda’s gaming unit has been strong, but its growth has lagged that of Chinese competitors like Tencent. Still, with over $1 billion in cash on Shanda’s balance sheet, analysts at Morgan Stanley believe it has the cash to finance a buyout, and could easily get other financing from a third party. In its release on Monday, Shanda’s board said it had received a proposal from the Chen family, saying that the group has held preliminary discussions with J.P. Morgan about financing the deal. The group also told the board that J.P. Morgan would serve as its financial adviser on the deal. The Shanda board said it would create an independent committee of board members to consider the transaction. Before Monday, shares were down about 16 percent on the year, and far off the high of about $62 a share in mid-2009.  Early Monday, shares of Shanda were trading at about $39, up about 17 percent from Friday’s close. Richard Ji, an Internet analyst at Morgan Stanley, said early Monday that Shanda had plenty of cash, and cited a report on the Chinese Web site Sina.com that Shanda was considering a public listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
