The investment banking arm of the Royal Bank of Canada said on Monday that it had hired two bankers, one to cover health care companies and the other to work with consumer corporations, as it continued to expand its footprint in the United States. The health care banker, NoÃ«l Brown, will join from Piper Jaffray and focus on biopharmaceutical deals. He previously worked at Lehman Brothers and then Barclays. The consumer banker, Jonathan Tretler, will join from Deutsche Bank, where he was co-head of food and beverages. He previously worked at UBS. Both will be based in New York. The moves are part of Royal Bank of Canada’s efforts to tap into the American market for growth. The firm has announced a number of hirings this year, including its co-heads of United States technology, a mergers and acquisitions specialist and an industrial banker. “We are pleased to welcome NoÃ«l and Jonathan to RBC’s U.S. investment banking platform,” Blair Fleming, the head of RBC Capital Markets’ investment banking group in the United States, said in a statement. “NoÃ«l’s proven track record in biotechnology and life sciences, and Jon’s strong background in food and beverages will further strengthen these two key client offerings that we continue to build strategically.” Advertisement
