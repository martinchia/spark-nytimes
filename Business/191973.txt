Talbots may find a home with Sycamore Partners after all. The troubled retail chain has agreed to open its books to the private equity firm, as it considers a possible sale, according to a filing disclosed on Monday.Â  The move comes about a month after Talbots officially rebuffed a $212 million buyout bid by Sycamore, deeming it too low. On Dec. 20, the company said it was exploring its strategic options, effectively putting itself up for sale. Those options now appear limited. Amid deteriorating sales, Talbots seems to be warming to the idea of finally selling itself to Sycamore, one of its largest investors with a 9.9 percent stake. Talbots, according to the filing, will provide Sycamore with “certain confidential information regarding the business, operations, strategy and prospects.” Founded in 1947, the retailer carved out a niche in the fashion industry by offering classic pieces, like blouses and pencil skirts, for a mature clientele. But in recent years, the chain, based in Hingham, Mass., has fallen out of favor with fashion analysts, who have criticized the brand for its dowdy style and its failure to appeal to younger generations.  The company has also struggled to reshuffle its management team. Last year, Talbots ousted its chief creative officer and announced the retirement of its chief executive, Trudy Sullivan. It has yet to announce successors, but it has hired Spencer Stuart to lead its C.E.O. search. “As one of Talbotsâ largest shareholders, we are concerned by the companyâs rapidly deteriorating performance,” Stefan L. Kaluzny, a Sycamore managing director, said in a letter to Talbots in December. “Nonetheless, we believe that Talbots has significant potential and remains a premier, storied brand.” At the time, Sycamore had offered $3 a share but said it was willing to consider increasing its offer if it had access to more information.  Talbots has a strong presence in North America, with about 550 stores in the United States and Canada. But its sales have been weak compared with many competitors in an already challenging economic environment.  It reported losses in the second and third quarters, recording a loss of $22.1 million, or 32 cents a share, in the third quarter alone. With losses mounting, Sycamore has questioned the company’s access to liquidity. As of December, Talbots had used up more than half of a $200 million credit line.  Shares of Talbots were relatively flat in early trading on Monday.  Advertisement
