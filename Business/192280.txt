Shire can get more from AbbVie. Shire, the London-listed drugmaker, is pondering a fresh, $51 billion unsolicited bid from its American rival. AbbVie claims shareholder support and is offering a hefty premium, but Shireâs board can probably extract one more increase in return for its recommendation. AbbVie’s chief executive, Rick Gonzalez, has spent a week courting Shireâs shareholders and returned with an 11 percent increase, offering 51.15 pounds a share in cash and stock, which he says reflects what shareholders want. Unusually, Mr. Gonzalez has made the offer public rather than first putting it to Shire. That allows AbbVie to control the presentation of this bid, but invites complaints from Shire about aggressive behavior. And unlike his peers at Pfizer, who tried and failed to snag AstraZeneca, Mr. Gonzalez hasnât tied his hands by declaring the bid final. This may not be quite the 55 pounds a share that some analysts want, but it is getting harder for Shire to argue that the proposal is too cheap. The premium to the companyâs share price before any bid interest emerged is now a rich 45 percent. It values Shire at 25 times next yearâs expected earnings, Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows, compared with a sector average of 18 times. And about 70 percent of the dealâs synergies would go to Shire, on Breakingviews’ calculations. Shireâs board still has some leverage. AbbVie will not rule out a hostile bid, but such deals are tricky in pharmaceutical industry. AbbVieâs own weakness helps, too; roughly 58 percent of its sales come from one drug, and its stock is lower-rated than Shireâs. A sharp sell-off suggests that the market expects a strong rebuttal from Shire. But that would risk angering shareholders, many of whom are fuming at the collapse of Astra-Pfizer. Another mooted alternative is to open talks before agreeing on price, but that would badly weaken the groupâs negotiating hand. So one plausible response is a gently worded rejection, based solely on valuation. That would signal that another increase would be enough to secure an agreed deal. AbbVie would have 10 days for its final move. Neil Unmack and Robert Cyran are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. For more independent commentary and analysis, visit breakingviews.com. Advertisement
