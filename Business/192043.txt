Dell  may have lost the fight over 3Par, but it has found a consolation prize in another data storage company: Compellent Technologies. The two companies announced on Thursday that Dell was in talks to buy Compellent for $27.50 a share. The proposed deal is effectively a take-under, with a bid that is 18.3 percent below Compellentâs closing price on Wednesday of $33.65. Shares of Compellent have nearly doubled in the last two months on takeover speculation. More fuel was added on Dec. 7, when the companyâs chief financial officer canceled an appearance at a technology conference scheduled for the next day. Dellâs offer values Compellent, based in Eden Prairie, Minn., at $876 million. But the companies cautioned that the proposal could fall apart. âThere can be no assurances that an agreement will be reached or that a transaction will be consummated,â the two said in a statement. Compellent stock tumbled 13.7 percent on Thursday to close at $29.04 a share. Dell ended down 0.2 percent, at $13.65 a share. The data storage sector has consolidated rapidly in the last two years, as technology giants rush to capitalize on the growth in cloud computing. Dell, EMC and Hewlett-Packard have offered rich prices for the marketâs top players. Three weeks ago, EMC agreed to buy Isilon Systems for $2.25 billion, a 28.8 percent premium over Isilonâs closing price the previous day. Hewlett-Packard and Dell battled for weeks this summer over 3Par. Dell initially bid $18 a share. After a string of counteroffers, H.P. emerged the victor with an offer of $33 a share, or $2.4 billion. Compellentâs rivals â like Isilon, 3Par and Data Domain â sell high-end data storage solutions that can be ramped up to meet the needs of even the largest companies. Thatâs why suitors are offering to pay more than nine times revenue for the companies, said Paul H. Mansky, a managing director at the research firm Cannacord Genuity. Compellent specializes in products for medium-size businesses, a less lucrative segment. Dellâs bid is roughly 4.5 times next yearâs sales, Mr. Mansky estimated. âAll the big acquisitions have been of high-end storage vendors,â he said. âThis is the strategy Dell wanted, and they fell short.â Even so, Compellent may make sense for Dell, analysts say. Dell first gained a stronghold in data storage with its 2007 purchase of EqualLogic for $1.4 billion. The computer maker also sells EMC products through a nearly decade-long partnership agreement. But Dell is winding down its relationship with EMC, a Compellent competitor, analysts say. Dellâs bid for 3Par was considered the first strike against EMC and a sign that Dell was ready to build its own storage business. âIf 3Par was a public separation, this announcement is the divorce,â said Mr. Mansky. Compellent also fits nicely into Dellâs distribution model, which caters to small and midsize businesses. While Dellâs motivations are clear, the real question is why Compellentâs board would entertain such a low offer. Jason Ader, an analyst at William Blair & Company, said it could reflect underlying business issues. âIf your stock is at $33, why would you be willing to sell at $27?â Mr. Ader asked. âWhat does that tell you about what theyâre thinking about their business longer term? Are they worried about their prospects?â  Advertisement
