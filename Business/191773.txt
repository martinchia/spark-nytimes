Two articles in Sunday’s Times contained reminders of the positive role that government can play in a market economy. Steve Lohr, who was a foreign correspondent in Japan back when it was booming, wrote the following, in a piece comparing Japan then with China now: … for certain industries, the Reagan administration took steps that amounted to a measured approach to industrial policy. Washington negotiated so-called voluntary export restraints with the Japanese in the automobile industry. That forced Japanese automakers to build factories in the United States that now employ many thousands of American workers. And a semiconductor trade agreement helped pry open the Japanese market. âPeople often forget that we did a lot of things to address the Japanese challenge,â says Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonpartisan research group in Washington…. âIn semiconductors, we got organized to defend and stay ahead,â says William A. Reinsch, a foreign trade expert and the chairman of the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a bipartisan advisory group to Congress. âIn that industry, there was a considerable amount of cooperation between the U.S. government and business. The computer chip industry was deemed too important to lose, not least because of all the military applications of computer chip technology.â And Gardiner Harris, a science correspondent in Washington, described a plan by the National Institutes of Health to finance drug research directly: The National Institutes of Health has traditionally focused on basic research, such as describing the structure of proteins, leaving industry to create drugs using those compounds. But the drug industryâs research productivity has been declining for 15 years, âand it certainly doesnât show any signs of turning upward,â said Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the institutes. The job of the new center, to be called the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, is akin to that of a home seller who spruces up properties to attract buyers in a down market. In this case the center will do as much research as it needs to do so that it can attract drug company investment. Obviously, there is a risk that the government won’t prove very good at making these kinds of investments. On the other hand, its track record is hardly terrible. The Internet is the most obvious product of a successful government research program, but it’s hardly the only one. In fact, the semiconductor — the same product that government policy helped in the 1980s trade wars with Japan — owes some of its initial success to Washington, too. As this Breakthrough Institute report on the history of innovation puts it: The purchasing power of the federal government made the microchip an affordable and ubiquitous technology.  Government procurement drove the price of microchips down by a factor of fifty in just a matter of years.  Consider this: without these public investments in the semiconductor revolution, your iPod would cost $10,000 and be the size of a room! An updated version of the Breakthrough report is here.
