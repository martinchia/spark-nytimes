Bitcoin can already be used to purchase a plane ticket, donate to a political campaign and pay a satellite TV bill. Beginning this fall, it can also be used to pay for a college education. On Friday, Kingâs College, a four-year evangelical school based in Lower Manhattan, said that it would become the first accredited college to allow students to pay their tuition in Bitcoin. It’s also the latest in a growing list of groups that have begun accepting virtual currency, fueled by a cottage industry dedicated to making online money easier to use.  A small liberal arts college committed to âthe truths of Christianity and a biblical worldview,â Kingâs charges $15,950 a semester for 12 to 18 credits, according to its website. King’s has about 500 students, according to the school’s president, Gregory Thornbury.  But Mr. Thornbury does not know how many of those students, or future students, will actually take advantage of the new payment method. Thatâs not surprising, given that many merchants say that just offering Bitcoin as an option can be a useful marketing tool. Mr. Thornbury said that the school was primarily motivated by the desire to be forward-thinking. âIt seems to be fairly similar to email 20 years ago,â Mr. Thornbury said in an interview Friday. âWhy would we need that? And then everybody has one.â While regulators debate the pros and cons of bitcoins, this volatile digital currency inspires the question: What makes money, money? Bitcoin, the computer-driven currency created by an anonymous programmer, has steadily gained a toehold in the mainstream since it appeared online in 2009. While established financial institutions have thus far shunned it amid fears about future regulation, a number of venture capital firms have jumped at the chance to capitalize on what they see as a growing market.  But critics contend that investors should be wary of Bitcoin because of the potential for scams and its volatility. Federal prosecutors shut down Silk Road, the popular Bitcoin marketplace, after accusing it of facilitating drug deals and other illegal transactions. And several regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, have recently sent out alerts to warn consumers about fraudulent investment schemes. Bitcoin’s price has swung from a few cents to more than $1,000 to its current price of about $600 in just a few years.  Still, plenty of entrepreneurs are eager to jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon. Companies like Coin.co and the more widely used Coinbase have made it easier for companies to accept Bitcoin by converting virtual currency into dollars. Coinbase already works with companies including Overstock.com and recently confirmed it would help Jared Polis, a congressman from Colorado, accept campaign donations. Just last month, Dish Network announced it would use Coinbase to let customers pay their satellite television bills.  Advertisement
