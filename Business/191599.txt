LONDON — The chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, which was effectively nationalized during the financial crisis, has decided to turn down his bonus after coming under heavy pressure from British politicians. Stephen Hester, the bankâs chief executive, was to have received a bonus of Â£963,000 ($1.5 million) in stock on top of his salary of Â£1.2 million. But the bank, which announced the bonus award on Thursday, confirmed on Sunday night that it had been refused. The bonus would have been less than half what Mr. Hester received last year for 2010, but it caused a public outcry as the share price in the bank, which is 82 percent owned by the British government, has fallen by a third over the last 12 months. Labour, the country’s opposition party, had proposed a nonbinding debate in Parliament in February to discuss whether Mr. Hester should be stripped of his bonus. On Monday, George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, called it “a sensible and welcome decision that enables Stephen Hester to focus on the very important job he has got to do, namely to get back billions of pounds of taxpayersâ money that was put into R.B.S.” The bank, based in Edinburgh, has announced thousands of job cuts as it reduces the size of its operations, particularly its investment banking unit. R.B.S. is in talks to sell its corporate brokerage business Hoare Govett to the investment bank Jefferies, according to a person briefed on the matter. The deal is expected to be announced this week. R.B.S. stock was down 2 percent in morning trading in London on Monday. Mr. Hester is not the first prominent banker to bow to public pressure. On Saturday, R.B.S. said its chairman, Philip Hampton, decided to give up his Â£1.4 million all-share bonus. AntÃ³nio Horta-OsÃ³rio, chief executive of the Lloyds Banking Group, in which the British government holds a 41 percent stake, said on Jan. 13 that he would waive his bonus, which could have totaled as much as Â£2.4 million. Mr. Horta-OsÃ³rio had taken a temporary leave of absence from the bank last year because of exhaustion. Pressure on British bankers is expected to increase in February as the countryâs major financial institutions, including Barclays and HSBC, publish yearly earning statements and decide on employee bonuses. John Hourican, the head of the investment banking division at R.B.S., for example, is in line for a Â£4 million bonus despite the bankâs continued poor performance. In January, British officials capped cash bonuses at both the R.B.S. and Lloyds at Â£2,000 for this year. Authorities are also trying to give shareholders more power over executive pay. Last week, Vince Cable, Britainâs business secretary, outlined proposals to change corporate pay practices to make compensation more transparent. Mr. Cable said companies should publish a single pay figure for top executives and rethink the makeup of compensation committees. He also outlined so-called clawback mechanisms that would allow companies to recover bonuses if top executives failed to perform. The current pay practices represented a “clear market failure,” Mr. Cable said. “Businesses and investors recognize that there is a disconnect between top pay and company performance and that something must be done.” Advertisement
