11:56 a.m. | Updated with Mr. Schwarzman’s comments There was a slight difference to the Blackstone Group’s quarterly earnings call with analysts on Thursday — it came with a bit of a Gallic note. As Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chairman and chief executive, spoke about Blackstone’s strong fourth-quarter earnings, he was dialed in not from New York City but the firm’s office in Paris. Mr. Schwarzman relocated to Paris on Monday, after spending much of last week in Davos, Switzerland, at the World Economic Forum, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. As previously reported, Mr. Schwarzman’s move will help him focus on Blackstone’s international operations. He is expected to stay in Europe for about four months.  Mr. Schwarzman told analysts that while he will be based in Paris, he will still be involved in all of the important activities of the firm, including discussions of the investment committee.  He added that being based in Europe would help in travel, especially to the Middle East and Asia, though he planned to be in New York once or twice a month. Still, he said, there is one potential downside to trading Manhattan’s slushy streets for the boulevards of Paris. “It’ll be fun getting phone calls at 2 in the morning,” he said, adding, “I think someone’s getting an extra six hours out of me.” Advertisement
