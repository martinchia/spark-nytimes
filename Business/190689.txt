HONG KONG–After a spring thaw that included several big  offerings, Hong Kongâs market for new  stock listings may be back on ice.  On Wednesday, the Nexteer Automotive  Group, a steering component supplier  and former unit of General Motors that is now  owned by Chinese investors, was forced  to postpone a Hong Kong initial public offering that would have raised as much  as 2.5 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $322  million, a person with direct knowledge  of the matter said.   The same day, the casino operator  Macau Legend Development announced it would slash by half an I.P.O.  that had planned to raise nearly $800  million. Instead, Macau Legend will  seek a maximum of 2.8 billion Hong  Kong dollars, or $360 million.  Two weeks earlier, Hopewell Hong  Kong Properties, a local developer,  postponed its $780 million deal, citing a  ââsignificant deterioration in market  sentiment,ââ according to stock exchange filings.  Hong Kong â the worldâs biggest market for new share listings from 2009  to 2011 â had looked to be recovering  from a 2012 slump as recently as last  month, when two large I.P.O.’s of more  than $1 billion each were completed. But  since then, the market has come under a double chill brought on by a cash squeeze in China and the United States Federal Reserveâs  plans to reduce quantitative easing. The  benchmark Hang Seng Index has declined 11.5 percent in the last month. ââThe combination of concerns on the  stability of the Chinese financial system  and investor repositioning in the wake  of last weekâs comments on potential  Q.E. tapering has negatively impacted  markets,ââ Andrew Swan, head of Asian  fundamental equities at BlackRock, an  asset manager, said in an e-mailed statement.  Nexteer, based in Saginaw, Mich., manufactures steering components and  was previously part of G.M.âs Delphi  unit. A subsidiary of the state-owned  Aviation Industry Corporation of China acquired majority control of Nexteer in  2011, and the owners planned to use the  money raised in the Hong Kong listing  to bolster production capacity and pay for  more research and development.  Whether the deal will be offered again would depend on market conditions, according to the person familiar with the  matter, who was not authorized to speak  publicly.  The underwriters of Nexteerâs I.P.O. are Bank of China International and J.P. Morgan. Macau Legendâs underwriters are CLSA Asia-Pacific, Citic Securities and Credit Suisse.   The underwriters of the spin-off listing of Hopewell Hong Kong Properties included B.O.C. International, Credit Suisse, J.P. Morgan, HSBC Holdings and Citigroup. Advertisement
