George Lee, who has served as co-head of group since 2008, will become the group’s chairman. He will also serve as chief information officer for the investment banking division, a newly created position.  Anthony Noto, the other co-head of the group, will remain in his role.  Mr. Noto’s new co-head will be Daniel Dees, who is relocating from Hong Kong, where he has been one of Goldman’s most senior bankers in Asia.

Mr. Noto led Twitter’s successful initial public offering last year, and Goldman has been making gains in the technology I.P.O. market, taking share from its chief rival, Morgan Stanley. As chairman of the TMT group, Mr. Lee will continue to work with some of the bank’s prominent technology clients. As chief information officer for the division, “he will identify and assess the impact of disruptive technology themes across our client base, provoking strategic discussion with clients across all industries and driving commercial opportunities for them and for the firm,” according to an internal memo. Mr. Lee joined Goldman in 1994, became a managing director in 2002, and made partner in 2004. With Mr. Dees’s departure from Hong Kong, Matthew Westerman will become sole head of the investment banking division in Asia Pacific excluding Japan.
