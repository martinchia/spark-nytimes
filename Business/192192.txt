In the heat of the deal, it is hard to remember that mergers and acquisitions are a risky business.  This is particularly true when management is seeking a defensive deal, one born out of desperation to âsaveâ the company or otherwise fight off an activist investor. It is not a deal born to further the company’s expansion but rather in response to its own distress. Instead of achieving its goal, a defensive deal too often simply exposes the fault lines of a company and its management.  The implosion at Dynegy is a good example, and we are about to see if something similar occurs with Zoranâs announced acquisition by CSR of Britain.   It will be awhile before the full facts of the failed Dynegy deal emerge.  But we know that after an earlier failed deal with the Blackstone Group, Dynegy turned to the billionaire financier Carl C. Icahn for a second transaction.  With the defeat of this second transaction, Dynegyâs chief executive and chief financial officer have resigned and the board has announced that it will not stand for re-election.  As an aside, Blackstone will now not receive the $27.5 million termination fee that Dynegy agreed to pay if the Icahn transaction succeeded. Bummer.  Signs of internal dissension at Dynegy had emerged a few weeks ago with the sudden resignation of Dynegyâs general counsel, J. Kevin Blodgett.  But the real distress for Dynegy began back in August when it announced the Blackstone transaction.  Management suddenly claimed that without an acquisition, Dynegy would likely be facing liquidity problems or worse.   The strategy backfired.  Management appeared to be raising alarm to force through a deal.  With the collapse of the Blackstone deal, management then suddenly announced the Icahn deal at the higher price of $5.50 a share.   The Icahn deal may have been the better one, but by this time management lacked credibility.   Moreover, by failing to obtain the support of Seneca Capital, a 12 percent shareholder, for the Icahn deal prior to announcement, Dynegy left an opponent out on the field.  This was an opponent who came back to fight.  Senecaâs opposition was notable since, according to Factset Sharkwatch, this was its first activist campaign since 2006.  The unusual nature of this challenge added to their credibility.  The Dynegy deal offers a lesson in public relations that I discussed last year.  But as DealBook reported on Tuesday, investors are increasingly scrutinizing and wary of board actions.  A significant transaction like a sale announcement brings focus onto the company.  And this focus may include new hedge fund shareholders who are much more willing to take risks and challenge management.  These risks are heightened when the deal is a defensive one, because there is more to criticize.  For another example, one need only look at the travails of Cedar Fair, which is still dealing with activist shareholders in the wake of its failed sale to Apollo Management. Cedar Fairâs management also raised alarm that it was in precipitous decline.  And defensive action is not just a deal announced when the company is in peril.  This week, Zoran, a maker of technology for digital photography and video, announced that it would be acquired by the British chip maker CSR in a deal valued at $679 million.  Zoran has been under siege in a proxy contest with the activist hedge fund Ramius, owner of 9.1 percent of the companyâs shares.  Ramius is running a campaign to replace six of Zoranâs seven directors on its board.  Ramius was underwhelmed by the CSR deal, asserting that it may undervalue Zoran.  Ramius also stated in a regulatory filing: âWe are suspicious that the announced merger with CSR may be yet another attempt by the current board of Zoran to usurp the will of the shareholders.  To announce such a transaction just weeks before the completion of our consent solicitation to remove and replace a majority of the board appears to be a last ditch effort by the board to insulate itself from shareholder action seeking new representation” In this acquisition, CSR will issue 1.85 new shares for each Zoran share.  The ratio here is a fixed one. If CSRâs shares decline between now and the closing, Zoran shareholders bear the risk.  CSRâs closing price on the London Stock Exchange just before the deal was announced was 434 pence.  CSRâs shares are now trading at about 380 pence.  This means that from an original implied price of $13.03 a share, Zoran shareholders are now to receive about $11 a share.  Zoranâs closing price was $9.32 a share before the deal was announced.  Part of the decline in CSRâs stock price was a result of the turmoil in the Mideast and the market sell-off it spurred,  but this price will continue to fluctuate until the deal closes. It is a bit odd, but a review of the acquisition agreement reveals that Zoran did not negotiate protection from fluctuations in CSRâs stock price.  This could have taken the form of a collar — a minimum price that Zoran would receive — or a right to terminate the agreement if CSRâs stock fell below a certain price. In fairness, Zoran has not agreed to pay a termination fee to CSR if its shareholders vote down this deal, a nicely negotiated feature of the deal that does preserve some optionality to reject the deal if price declines.  CSR is not listed in the United States and so it will need to register its American depository shares here and list them on Nasdaq.  There is likely to be significant flow of money back to Britain once the deal is done, perhaps further depressing the CSR share price.  The reason why is that many institutional investors who previously held Zoran stock may not be permitted to hold shares of foreign companies. Even from this bare review of the transaction details, Ramius will have grist for its fight and claims that Zoran was rushed into a deal.  Or alternatively, Zoran will claim that stock was the only viable consideration and that this allows the company to profit from any upturn in the market, albeit as part of a British company.   Ramius has made no signs of stopping its consent solicitation.  And so we are about to see another aspect of defensive M.&A. —  the deal to halt and/or satisfy shareholder activism. These deals can have success; the deal between Sanofi-Aventis and Genzyme involved the consent of a number of shareholder activists, including the increasingly Zellig-like Mr. Icahn.  But it is hard work, and announcing a deal without the consent of current activist shareholders means that your opponent is outside waiting to throw stones.  These deals ultimately show that deal makers need to be extremely well prepared from the start when announcing defensive M.&A. transactions.  Public relations is important as is co-opting potential opponents as soon as possible.  Chief executives be warned.  With your entire company under scrutiny, if you cannot sell your story in a defensive M.&A. transaction, it may very likely be you who is looking for an alternative opportunity.  Advertisement
