 The discount retailer Family Dollar, under pressure from the activist investor Carl C. Icahn to sell itself, said its profit fell by a third as competition intensified and the company cleared inventory ahead of planned store closings. Mr. Icahn, Family Dollar’s largest shareholder, with a 9.4 percent stake, wants the company to sell itself to its rival Dollar General. Family Dollar, which has underperformed in the sector, said in April that it would slash prices on 1,000 basic items, close 370 stores and slow its expansion plans. On Thursday, the company said it would start selling beer and wine next year. Net income for the third quarter fell 33 percent to $81.1 million, or 71 cents a share. Excluding items, earnings amounted to 85 cents a share. Net sales rose 3.3 percent to $2.66 billion, slightly above the average analyst estimate of $2.61 billion. A version of this brief appears in print on July 11, 2014, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Family Dollar Posts Lower Profit, as Carl Icahn Presses for a Sale.
