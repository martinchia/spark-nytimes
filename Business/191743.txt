Guy Kulman is the president and founder of Bay Island Capital. From 2001 to 2008, Mr. Kulman worked at Lehman Brothers, most recently as a vice president for the firm’s chief legal officer and vice chairman. I got back from Berkshire Hathawayâs annual meeting on Sunday and was sitting down that night to write a post on my blog about the weekend.  I did not get far â my Twitter feed started going nuts: We had killed Osama bin Laden. The next day, I had a bizarre feeling and I think I wore a smirk, if not a smile, most of the day.  It caused me to reflect on my time on Wall Street, but for a change, not with the critical eye to constant abuses of ethics, greed and incompetence. For some reason, I donât think about or talk about it very often, but Sept. 11, 2001, was my second full day at Lehman Brothers.  I had just finished three weeks of training and had just started my first rotation in the mergers and acquisitions group.  I lived at 60th Street and 10th Avenue in Manhattan, so I took the subway from Columbus Circle down to the World Trade Center stop. As the subway train approached downtown, the conductor made a garbled announcement that âthis local train was going express from here on down.â  Still pretty unfamiliar with that subway line, I started asking people on the train what that meant. I wasnât sure if it would stop at the World Trade Center or if I would end up in Brooklyn.  Unsure of what to do, I got off at Chambers Street.  It was about 40 minutes after 8 a.m., so I figured I would have plenty of time to walk to 3 World Financial Center. As I climbed up the steps from the subway station to the street, I heard, or rather felt, a loud noise that shook the ground.  Instinctively, I ran right down the steps.  I hadnât seen a thing, but a mother carrying a baby came running down the steps, screaming, âA helicopter hit the World Trade Center.â I think I waited a minute or two and then peeked up the stairs.  I remember looking at the tower and thinking:  âWow, that building is something else.â  In my head, it was clear that something bad had happened, but from where I stood on Chambers Street and West Broadway, the building seemed impenetrable with a totally fixable gash in its side. I instantly dialed my mother in Sarasota, Fla.  I knew that if she watched the TV news, she would have a heart attack.  I got her on the phone.  âMom, a helicopter hit the World Trade Center,” I told her. “Donât worry, I donât work in that building.  I work at 3 World Financial next door.  Iâm fine, and Iâm heading to work.â So I leisurely started walking toward 3 World Financial Center.  I think I walked across at Chambers Street and then down the West Side Highway.  As I got closer and closer, brain dead as I am, it started to occur to me that maybe I shouldnât be going to work.  I guess it hadnât quite occurred to me how close the North Tower was to 3 World Financial Center.  By now, the damage had gotten worse, and I remember thinking to myself that maybe itâs not so safe to be in the building next door. I dialed up work to say that I didnât think I should come to work.  But it was my second day and I didnât really know who to call yet.  I then tried to call my good friend from college, Brian, who had started at Lehman a year before me.  I wanted to see if he was at the office and see if he wanted to leave.  As I was looking down to press the digits on my phone, I felt and heard another explosion.  This time, I also saw a fireball out of the corner of my eye. I took off running north and didnât stop until I reached Stuyvesant High School at the western end of Chambers Street.  Some guy was running next to me.  He said, âA plane hit the World Trade Center.â  I said, âIt was a helicopter.â  He said, âNo, a plane, two planes hit the towers.  I saw them both.â  It was then that I turned around, and saw both towers on fire. I started running north, pulled out my phone and hit dial.  My mom picked up again.  She hadnât even put on the TV based on my helicopter report.  I told her: âMom, where are you? Call Dad at the hospital.  President Bush is in Sarasota, and you got to make sure youâre nowhere near him.  We are under attack.â  I then filled her in on the details of what I knew about two planes. The guy who had told me about the planes was still next to me.  He had been trying to dial his wife in Boston, but his phone wasnât working.  He asked me how I got through.  It seemed everyone walking near us couldnât get a phone line.  Afraid of losing my connection, I gave this random guy my phone so he could have my mom call his wife from another phone line at home.   My mom managed to get the guyâs wife and tell him that her husband was O.K.  I canât remember where he worked, but I think he had been at the World Financial Center. This guy and I walked up the West Side Highway together all the way up to 60th Street.  He hadnât grabbed his wallet, so I bought him some water, and wished him luck.  He had family in New York and was going to try to find them somewhere uptown. Iâm skipping a lot of steps here, but I ended up going back to my apartment and tried to track down friends who lived in New York and Washington.  I also called the chief administrative officer of the M.&A. group at Lehman to ask if I was supposed to be doing anything.  I actually reached her and she said there was nothing for me to do.  However, right after we hung up, she called me back and asked if I could pull together a list of other people in my starting class. I called her back once I had pulled together some names.  She then asked if I would be willing to head over to the Lehman offices in New Jersey to unpack computer boxes and help set up servers.  She also asked I could call some others on the list to volunteer.  My recollection of facts is so fuzzy, itâs bizarre, but I know I went over to New Jersey and unpacked boxes for hours and hours. There were lots of volunteers.  There were also people from the various computer companies teaching the more tech-savvy volunteers how to assemble components.  I stuck to the boxes. A few days later, we reported to work at the Sheraton Hotel in New York, where Lehman created makeshift headquarters following 9/11.  Again, the details are fuzzy, but I remember Lehman’s chief executive, Dick Fuld, making a speech to the whole company.  It was a great speech and it rallied the company in a major way. I spent the next month volunteering in any way I could.  I didnât do any real banking work, but along with a bunch of fellow bankers just starting out, we created an I.T. help desk to help the overstretched real I.T. people troubleshoot computer problems in the hotel offices.   The I.T. professionals would teach us solutions, and we would go floor to floor fixing problems and reporting back new issues.  It was crazy â my friends from Stanford who always knew me as the least technical person in the world couldnât imagine me fixing computers.  I did this for about a month, until I got assigned to a real M.&A. deal, which kept me working 24/7 for seven straight months. Thatâs how my career at Lehman Brothers began in September 2001. This week we killed Bin Laden and I was smiling all day long.  And for a change, I was looking back at my days on Wall Street and remembering how we pulled together at Lehman.  I still canât believe that seven years later, in September 2008, I found myself at the office on the 31st floor of Lehman Brothers, in the middle of the night, drafting a press release with corporate communications that would announce the firm was filing for bankruptcy.
