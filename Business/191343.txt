LONDON — Executives at Britainâs biggest companies received an average pay increase of 49 percent this year, with compensation rising faster than companiesâ shares. The annual average pay of executives, including chief executives and finance chiefs, at Britainâs 100 largest publicly listed companies rose to Â£2.7 million, or $4.3 million, according to research by Incomes Data Services published Friday. Chief executives received an average 43.5 percent pay increase, to Â£3.9 million, the report said. The FTSE 100 share index rose 15.8 percent in the period from February last year to April 2011. âBritainâs economy may be struggling to return to pre-recession levels of output, but the same cannot be said of FTSE 100 directorsâ remuneration,â Steve Tatton, editor of the report, said in a statement. The pay includes salary, benefits, bonuses and long-term incentive plans. Deborah Hargreaves, chairwoman of the High Pay Commission, an independent group that examines private sector pay, told BBC radio that it was âvery hard to justify these sorts of pay increasesâ and that it was in the interest of the executives to keep the market rate for their positions high.
