Renault, the French carmaker, said Wednesday that it was selling more than 300 million shares of the Swedish truckmaker Volvo AB to institutional investors to raise more than 3 billion euros, or $4.2 billion, with plans to use the money to reduce its debt by divesting the nearly 15 percent stake in the company. Renaultâs shares rose 2.19 euros, or more than 6 percent, to 38.71 euros on Thursday in midmorning trading in Paris.  In trading in Stockholm, Volvoâs shares slipped from 93.8 kroner at the open, down 4.05 kroner, or 4.17 percent, to 93 kroner, the price at which Renault sold the B shares. At the end of June, Renault said it had 4.66 billion euros, or $6.5 billion, in debt, and in its statement Wednesday said that the Volvo sale would reduce that debt to less than 3 billion euros, a level that a spokeswoman for the carmaker called âprudent.â “The funds raised from the placement will strengthen Renault’s balance sheet in preparation for the launch of our new strategic plan next year,” Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of the Renault and Nissan, said. Renault kept its A shares, and therefore 17.5 percent of the voting rights in Volvo, making it still one of the the companyâs major stakeholders.  Renault acquired the Volvo shares when it sold its truck division to the Swedish company in 2001. Volvo AB, not to be confused with the carmaker that Ford Motor sold to Geely, has seen its shares rise from 60 kroner early in the year to nearly 100 kroner more recently, as the cyclic heavy vehicle sector recovers — a major factor in the timing of the Renault sale. Goldman Sachs was the sole bookrunner for the share sale, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. –Chris V. Nicholson Go to Renault Statement Â»
