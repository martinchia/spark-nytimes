 CNBCâs Jim Cramer talks with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner about the global economy and what sovereign nations in Europe and around the world are doing to deal with the threat of default. Despite the latest shock of tough news to hit Europe’s financial sector, the Continent’s governments will not allow another bank to collapse like Lehman Brothers, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said on Wednesday. Speaking at CNBC’s Delivering Alpha conference in midtown Manhattan, Mr. Geithner acknowledged that European regulators had traditionally been more “indulgent” of their banks, given the institutions’ close ties to their governments.  But European governments and banking authorities realize they need to shore up their banking institutions, he said. “They recognize they have to do more,” Mr. Geithner told CNBC’s Jim Cramer. “They recognize they’re behind the curve.” When asked whether Europe would be “alive or dead, and meaningful” in several months as part of a “lightning round” of questions, Mr. Geithner quickly responded “alive.” Later, when asked if Greece would be saved, and if that would require additional financial support from Germany, Mr. Geithner answered, “It takes time and it does not work unless it’s supported by money.”  Mr. Geithner also defended the Obama administration’s policies, including proposed tax code changes that would raise rates on the wealthiest Americans.  “We think it makes sense to make modest changes to the tax benefits,” he said. “There are limits to what we can do without being fundamentally unfair.” He addressed one of the biggest points of contention between corporate America and the administration — allowing corporations to bring home overseas profits without being taxed — with a hint that the White House would ease some restrictions on repatriating earnings. But such a move would only be accompanied by broader tax code changes. The conversation was not all doom and gloom. When Mr. Cramer asked if Mr. Geithner was ever afraid of being fired, the Treasury secretary quipped, “I’ve been hoping” before trailing off, earning more than a few laughs from the audience and his interlocutor.
