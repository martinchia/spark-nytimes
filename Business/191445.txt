 Richard L. Sharp, the longtime chief executive of the now-defunct electronics retailer Circuit City and a founder of the used-car dealership chain CarMax, died on June 24 at his home outside Richmond, Va. He was 67. The cause was Alzheimer’s disease, CarMax said. During Mr. Sharp’s tenure as Circuit City’s chief executive, from 1986 to 2000, the company’s revenue grew to $10.6 billion from $175 million. In the early 1990s, he oversaw a team at Circuit City that led to the creation of CarMax, which had more than 135 stores with revenue of $12.5 billion in its latest fiscal year. He went with CarMax when Circuit City spun it off as a separate publicly traded company in 2002. He retired as board chairman in 2007. Circuit City filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008. After failing to find a buyer, the company announced in January 2009 that it was going out of business.

He spent his later years promoting Alzheimer’s disease research. A native of Alexandria, Va., Mr. Sharp studied electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Virginia and the College of William and Mary. He later attended Harvard Business School’s advanced management program. Before joining Circuit City in 1982, he led a custom hardware and software business development company that he founded when he was 27.
