Michael Perino, a professor of law at St. Johnâs University School of Law, is the author of “The Hellhound of Wall Street: How Ferdinand Pecoraâs Investigation of the Great Crash Forever Changed American Finance” (Penguin Press), which is out Thursday.
 For 16 months in the depths of the Great Depression, Ferdinand Pecora, a former New York prosecutor turned Senate inquisitor, captivated the country. He chronicled how, in the run up to the 1929 crash, Wall Streetâs elite financiers manipulated stocks, dodged taxes and collected enormous bonuses for peddling shoddy securities to unsuspecting Americans. The sensational headlines galvanized public opinion for reform, giving Congress the political cover it needed to pass the first federal securities laws and the Glass-Steagall Act. âWe built completely on his work,â one of the drafters of those laws acknowledged. In May 2009, Congress evoked the Pecora hearings when it created the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a panel chaired by Phil Angelides. A former California treasurer, Mr. Angelides said that he kept Pecoraâs memoirs near his bed and that his goal, like Pecoraâs, was to âdeepen the national dialogue about the need and the shape of reform.â Last month, the commission held its last hearing. Few will notice its absence. The panelâs investigation has generated nowhere near the attention of the Pecora hearings and had no discernible influence over the financial reforms passed this year. How did the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission fail so badly when Pecora succeeded so spectacularly? The explanation lies in the way these two investigations were organized and in how they used their bully pulpit. The Pecora hearings were a juggernaut. The honest and ferociously independent Pecora dominated the investigation, going wherever the evidence took him. He used his subpoena power liberally to pry documents out of recalcitrant banks. Pecora could act aggressively because he had the backing of two committee chairmen and President Roosevelt, all of whom wanted a full-throated investigation. Uncovering Wall Streetâs sins, they knew, would ease passage of the kind of reform legislation that normally succumbs to special interest wrangling. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, by contrast, was made to founder. Rather than selecting a single experienced investigator to run the inquiry, Congress created an independent commission stocked with members carefully selected for their political connections, gravitas and competing viewpoints. The need to build consensus would necessarily bog down the commissionâs efforts. Making the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission an independent commission was meant to shield it from political influence, but it also made the commission a political orphan, lacking any overt backing by either Congress or the president. Predictably, the investigation was delayed for months as Mr. Angelides and the vice chairman, Bill Thomas, a Republican, negotiated staffing issues. Congress further hamstrung the effort by placing inordinate restrictions on the commissionâs use of its subpoena power. Issuing one requires either agreement by Mr. Angelides and Mr. Thomas or a vote by a majority of the commissioners, including at least one minority member. Given that cumbersome procedure, it was hardly a surprise when Mr. Angelides announced that he would prefer firms to cooperate voluntarily. They often didnât, but it was only when foot dragging grew excessive that the commission was able to act. The highest profile incident occurred last June and involved Washingtonâs current favorite whipping boy, Goldman Sachs. The firm had stalled the commission since January and then inundated it with five terabytes of unindexed information â the equivalent of several billion pages of documents. Mr. Angelides complained: ”We did not ask them to pull up a dump truck to our offices and dump a bunch of rubbish.” Struggling through the voluminous material, the commission’s staff soon discovered important documents were missing. It was only in the face of these overtly obstructionist tactics that the committee issued a subpoena. Goldman became more cooperative and apologized for its actions, but as public attention waned, the firmâs contrition faded. A month later Mr. Angelides was once again complaining about Goldmanâs failure to answer crucial questions. And yet he resisted issuing more subpoenas, the one action that had succeeded in getting Goldmanâs attention. âWe’ve already asked Goldman for this information,â he said. âI have every expectation they will comply. They’ve told us they will.  I believe them.â It is hard to imagine Pecora would have been so trusting. Those structural problems were more than enough to doom the investigation. The commission compounded them in both the substance and style of the hearings. Pecora succeeded by crystallizing amorphous anger at Wall Street into hard facts and concrete evidence. Many people at the time believed that problems in the stock market were confined to shady pool operators and short sellers, people who were widely assumed to use any methods (legal or illegal) to make money. Pecora showed for the first time that Wall Streetâs derelictions went much higher. He took on the elite leaders of the most prestigious firms and revealed how they too had put their own financial interests ahead of everything else. Mr.  Angelides recognized the same need to tell angry Americans something they didnât already know. âWe canât just rehash what weâve known to date,â he acknowledged. That was a tough assignment given all of the information about the financial crisis already in existence, an assignment that the commission was ultimately unable to handle. Anyone watching the proceedings would have heard one more recitation about the problems associated with credit default swaps and subprime mortgages, about ratings agencies that were captives of the firms that paid their fees, and about institutions that were too big to fail. There was precious little new here. That brings us to style. Mr. Angelides oft-repeated admonition that he wanted to âshed light not heatâ translated into hearings that were just plain dull. From bland opening statements to long-winded and sanctimonious speeches, the commissioners eschewed any attempt to develop a coherent narrative listeners could follow. During one hearing Mr. Thomas stated forthrightly that he didnât want to âget lost in â¦ the intriguing stories.â The resulting hearings were what even Mr. Thomas called a Whitmanâs Sampler of topics likely to be covered in the final report. It is, to be sure, unfair to place all the blame for that outcome on the commission. Congress ordered the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission to study how 22 separate factors contributed to the financial crisis. With that broad mandate and the short time it had to operate, the commission had little choice but to pursue a scattershot approach. Still, had the commissioners forgone their moment in the sun and turned the questioning over to a seasoned courtroom advocate, the hearings might have proved far more compelling. Pecora knew that a little bit of sensationalism goes a long way. He was a skilled teacher and he understood that it was important, indeed crucial, to dwell on Mr. Thomasâs âintriguing stories.â Those stories were not just useless fluff; they were the vehicle through which Pecora could illustrate why more regulation was vital, and he devoted most of his time to spinning compelling narratives out of the welter of complex details. Pecora realized, much more so than the commission’s members, that dissecting one shady transaction and showing how specific bankers ripped off specific clients was far more effective than endless testimony about theoretical conflicts of interest. That was how he created the clamor for reform.  His genius was his ability to convert complex economic problems into simple morality plays. Pecora wrote in his memoirs: âLegal chicanery and beneficent darkness were the bankerâs stoutest allies.â  His investigation succeeded because he was willing to shine the âfierce light of publicity and criticismâ on the wrongful practices he unearthed. To emulate his success, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission needed both heat and light.  Unfortunately, they gave us neither. — Michael Perino Go to Michael Perino’s Website Â» Advertisement
