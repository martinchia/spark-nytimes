Portugal Telecom announced on Wednesday that it had signed a deal to take a 22.38 percent stake in the Brazilian telecommunications company Telemar Norte Leste, also known as Oi. The stake represents 8.32 billion reals ($5 billion) in cash and awards Portugal Telecom “significant corporate governance rights” over the Brazilian company. A strategic partnership between the two companies demonstrates Portugal Telecomâs continued interest in the Brazilian market even after it sold its 50 percent stake in the cellphone operator Vivo to TelefÃ³nica of Spain in July. Under the terms of its investment, Portugal Telecom can nominate one member and one alternate member to the board at the Oi subsidiary, TmarPart, as well as two members and two alternate members to the board of TNL. The sake will also give Portugal Telecom a say in the nomination process for the chief executive of Oi. Portugal Telecom said it hoped to contribute significantly to the improvement of Oiâs performance, citing its successful experience in fixed-to-mobile convergence, mobile broadband and pay TV, as ways it might do this.
