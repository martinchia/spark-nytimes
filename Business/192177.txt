Raj Rajaratnam and Anil Kumar met 30 years ago at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, ambitious graduate students who had come to the United States for an elite business education. On Thursday, the two met again under very different circumstances. Mr. Kumar took the witness stand in Federal District Court in Lower Manhattan on the third day of the trial of Mr. Rajaratnam, the central figure in the governmentâs vast investigation into insider trading at hedge funds. The 52-year-old Mr. Kumar, a former senior executive at McKinsey & Company, the management consulting firm, pleaded guilty last year to receiving about $2 million from Mr. Rajaratnam in exchange for confidential information about his McKinsey clients. The Indian-born Mr. Kumar appeared somber on the witness stand. But he also came off as an intelligent and articulate witness, speaking directly to the jury when explaining concepts like hedge funds and initial public offerings. Mr. Kumar described how he and Mr. Rajaratnam, a Sri Lankan native, got to know each other at Wharton through the South Asian community and stayed in touch through the years. At McKinsey, Mr. Kumar and his partners twice pitched Mr. Rajaratnam on developing a consulting arrangement that would provide insights on business to support the investment decisions of the Galleon Group, Mr. Rajaratnamâs hedge fund. Mr. Rajaratnam ignored McKinseyâs overtures, Mr. Kumar said. But Mr. Kumar said that after a charity event in New York in the fall of 2003, Mr. Rajaratnam pulled him aside, telling him that he wanted his insights, not McKinseyâs, and that he was willing to pay him $500,000 a year for them. Mr. Kumar said he initially rejected Mr. Rajaratnamâs offer, explaining that McKinsey would not allow the separate arrangement. But Mr. Rajaratnam persisted. âPeople are making fortunes,â he recalled Mr. Rajaratnam saying. âSo just keep track of your knowledge and share it with me.â Mr. Rajaratnam also devised a scheme to hide the arrangement from McKinsey. He suggested that Mr. Kumar open a Swiss bank account in someone elseâs name. Mr. Rajaratnam also proposed that the money paid to Mr. Kumar should be re-invested in a Galleon fund in the name of Mr. Kumarâs housekeeper. Mr. Kumar capitulated, and in 2003 began to pass tips about his clients to Mr. Rajaratnam. âI felt an obligation to try and help himâ once he began paying me, Mr. Kumar said. His testimony continues next week. On cross-examination, the defense is expected to portray Mr. Kumar as an unreliable government witness cooperating for a lesser prison sentence. Earlier on Thursday, jurors heard for the first time secretly recorded telephone conversations between Mr. Rajaratnam and those whom the government says were his co-conspirators. Tapes were played during the testimony of the first witness, Diane Wehner, a special agent with the F.B.I. Although the ostensible purpose of Ms. Wehnerâs testimony was to establish the authenticity of the wiretapped conversations, the government used her to give the jury a glimpse of what they are expected to hear during the testimony of more substantive witnesses. The jury heard snippets of three recorded phone conversations involving Mr. Rajaratnam. Among them was a discussion between Mr. Rajaratnam and Rajiv Goel, a former Intel executive, who has also pleaded guilty and is testifying for the government. The government claims that Mr. Rajaratnam bought stock in Mr. Goelâs brokerage account because of confidential information he had learned from a board member of PeopleSupport, which was about to be acquired. âAnd I know the dealâs going to get done at $12.25, which is three bucks above, right?â Mr. Rajaratnam said to Mr. Goel. He added: âWe know because one of our guys is on the board. We know they are going to put $41 million in escrow. Itâs a $250 million deal.â On cross-examination, Mr. Rajaratnamâs lawyer argued that the conversations were taken out of context. In another call, Mr. Rajaratnam asked a colleague, on a down day for stocks, how the markets were treating him.  âLike a baby treats a diaper,â said the colleague.  Mr. Rajaratnam giggled. Correction: An earlier version of the story incorrectly said Raj Rajaratnam and Anil Kumar met 20 years ago at Wharton. They met 30 years ago.
