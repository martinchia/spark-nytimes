Jeffrey Smith, chief of the hedge fund Starboard Value, argues against Darden Restaurantsâ decision to sell Red Lobster in a $2.1 billion deal. Updated, 3:42 p.m. | Starboard Value officially unveiled its effort to unseat the entire Darden board. The company replied with its own statement, arguing that the activist hedge fund was attempting to take control of the company well out of proportion to its stake, which now stands at about 6.2 percent. And Barington Capital, the other activist hedge fund involved in the Darden fight, said in a statement that it believes “it’s time for a change in the Darden boardroom.” Original post | One of the activist hedge funds pushing for change at Darden Restaurants plans to take a big swing at the company in the wake of a planned sale of the Red Lobster chain. The investment firm, Starboard Value, is seeking to unseat the restaurant operator’s entire 12-member board, people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday. The move comes after Darden announced plans last week to sell Red Lobster to Golden Gate Capital, a private equity firm, for about $2.1 billion. Both Starboard and another hedge fund, the Barington Capital Group, fiercely criticized the deal as a “fire sale” that shortchanged them and other investors. Darden had announced late last year that it was exploring a spinoff or sale of the seafood chain, a strategy that fell far short of what the investment firms preferred: a more substantial breakup of the restaurant operator. Starboard had won support for a special shareholder meeting, at which investors would have held a nonbinding vote on the wisdom of a Red Lobster divestiture. But Darden pre-empted the meeting by striking the deal with Golden Gate. Now the hedge fund is responding by seeking to replace every single director. Among its nominees are Bradley Blum, a former president of Olive Garden, and Charles Sonsteby, a onetime chief financial officer of Brinker International, the parent of Chili’s, one of the people briefed on the matter said. Starboard owns a roughly 5.5 percent stake.  News of Starboard’s plans was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal. Advertisement
