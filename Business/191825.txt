One of the summerâs most-anticipated financial blogs — at least by DealBook — appears to have met a swift demise. Tuesday, DealBook got wind of a blog created by a summer analyst (read: intern) at a middle-market investment bank in Los Angeles, who promised to write about his trials on the job — under the pseudonym âMumbles.â Sadly, as of Wednesday morning, Mumbles is no more. The rogue blog, titled “Life of an Investment Banking Summer Slave,” had been deleted by the second day. Itâs too bad. The newcomer showed some promise. In the inaugural post, Mumbles introduced himself: “I don’t have a 4.0 G.P.A., play lacrosse or belong to any secret societies. Rather, I play real sports — basketball and golf, do enough to get by in school and prefer a C.F.A. to an M.B.A.”  
This summer, I joined an exclusive club. A club filled with Ivy Leaguers, valedictorians, paper pushers, foot soldiers, and me, the chip-on-the-shoulder state school kid. We call ourselves: Investment Banking Summer Analysts — essentially, we’re superheroes without the capes. Mumblesâs pair of posts included tips like “Never Go Home Before a V.P.” and ruminations on the grunt work that is expected of summer analysts. 
A large portion of my week has been spent formatting. Formatting letters, profiles, lists, databases, etc.; if you can imagine it, I probably formatted it this week. This exposed me to one of the pillars of corporate finance — an incredible attention to detail. Not only was the content of the reports I was compiling expected to be a hundred percent accurate, but so too was the formatting, which from what I gather, is suppose to display a sense of professionalism, both internally and to our clients.  It was also an earnest, if somewhat breathless, portrait of a young man chasing the dream. We do enormous amounts of work, efficiently, and in not so enormous amounts of time. … We work ourselves to within an inch of our sanity because somewhere out there, in the distance, we see a faint and distant picture of our desired future. A future filled with summer homes in the Hampton’s [sic], private jets, and model trophy wives, all by the age of thirty five. The short-lived blog appears to have been an homage to the earlier work of Leveraged Sell-out, a pseudonymous blogger whose humorous musings, supposedly from the front lines of finance, were turned into a book titled “Damn It Feels Good to be a Banker” in 2008. Mumbles, who calls Leveraged Sellout “one of my favorite literary wordsmiths,” adopted the book title for the URL of his blog. We’re guessing that Mumbles’s blog was removed because a co-worker spotted it. In one post, he wrote about blogging from work “while your V.P. searches the Internet” for inappropriate material. His firm’s compliance policies almost certainly prohibit unapproved blogs. Advertisement
