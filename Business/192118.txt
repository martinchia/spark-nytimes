Sanofi-Aventis, the French drug maker, turned its $18.5 billion takeover bid for the United States biotechnology company Genzyme hostile on Monday but stuck to the same terms, having failed to persuade the Genzyme board to allow it to conduct due diligence. The offer of $69 a share is a premium of 31 percent over Genzymeâs one-month average up to July 22, the day before rumors of the bid first surfaced in the media. Genzyme responded by urging shareholders to take no action while its board reviews the offer, pledging to advise them within ten business days.  Henri Termeer, chief executive of the biotech company, said in August that the offer âdramatically undervaluesâ his company but has been unwilling to name his price.   Sanofi is seeking to acquire Genzyme for its drugs that treat rare diseases, like enzyme deficiencies. The biotechnology field has proved more resistant to competition from generics, which are threatening Sanofiâs product line and profits. In a statement Monday, Sanofi said that a meeting on Sept. 20 with Genzyme management had proved unproductive. But from meetings with Genzyme shareholders, âit was clearâ that they âare supportive of our initiative and, like us, are frustrated with your refusal to have meaningful discussions with us regarding our proposal,â Christopher A. Viehbacher, chief executive of Sanofi, wrote in a letter addressed to Mr. Termeer. Those shareholders hold more than half of Genzyme’s shares, Mr. Viehbacher said, suggesting the hostile bid will succeed. The offer expires Dec. 10. The Paris-based drug giant had been expected in some quarters to raise its final offer. Citigroup analysts wrote in a recent note that they expected a bid of up to $77 per share. But Sanofi was hesitant to offer more because of Genzymeâs recent manufacturing difficulties. Genzyme had a viral infection in one of its plants last year, cutting its manufacturing capacity and leading to the rationing of two drugs: Cerezyme, which treats Gaucherâs disease, and Fabrazyme, for Fabryâs disease. The company said last month that would normalize the distribution of Fabrazyme next year.  Rations for Cerezyme are set to end this year. In the letter, Mr. Viehbacher said he had sought information about Genzymeâs âanticipated manufacturing recoveryâ at the Sept. 20 meeting, but was rebuffed. He added that Mr. Termeer also was unwilling to give his âperspective on an appropriate valuation for Genzyme.â In his August letter rejecting Sanofiâs bid, Mr. Termeer said Genzyme is worth more because it is poised to increase its manufacturing capacity, reduce costs, and deliver on promising drugs in its pipeline. âWithout exception, each member of the Genzyme board believes this is not the right time to sell the company, because your opportunistic takeover proposal does not begin to recognize the significant progress underway,â Genzyme said in August. As it seeks to fend off Sanofi, Genzyme has been engaged in other deals as well. The company said last month that it had agreed to sell its genetics unit to Laboratory Corporation of America for $925 million. It is also seeking to divest itself of its diagnostic products and pharmaceutical intermediates units, in line with a plan it announced in May. Sanofi shares were down slightly in morning trading in Paris. Sanofi said it had secured financing for the cash bid from BNP Paribas and SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale in France, as well as J.P. Morgan Europe. The company was advised by Evercore Partners and J.P. Morgan, and has hired Weil, Gotshal & Manges as counsel. Genzyme is being advised by Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs, and has hired Ropes & Gray as counsel. –Chris V. Nicholson Go to Article from The New York Times Â»
