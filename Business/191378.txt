11:00 p.m. | Updated  The activist investor Nelson Peltz has taken on yet another target, calling on the State Street Corporation to bolster shareholder value by actions including cutting costs and potentially selling business units. In a public letter on Sunday to State Streetâs board, Mr. Peltzâs investment firm, Trian, said that it had been holding private conversations with its management for a year. Among Trianâs concerns are growing costs and a history of expensive acquisitions. State Street, a financial holding company based in Boston, also suffers from a history of recurring charges that it has been calling ânonrecurring,â including restructuring and legal expenses.  Shares in State Street have fallen more than 15 percent over the last year and nearly 47 percent over the last five years. They closed on Friday at $33.90. Still, shares in Northern Trust have fallen 24.2 percent over the past year, while those in the Bank of New York Mellon have tumbled 26.6 percent. But Trian also argued that State Street’s investment management unit reported a 28 percent adjusted operating margin last year, while its competitors reported an average margin of 45 percent. Should State Street not take additional steps to improve its stock price, Trian hinted at a more aggressive campaign against the firm. “Trian remains willing to work closely and constructively with State Street to create greater shareholder value,” the firm wrote in its letter. “However, if management and the board fail to make progress, Trian may decide to become significantly more active in evaluating its alternatives as a large shareholder.” State Street responded in its own statement:  Despite the challenging operating environment over the past several years, our business has remained resilient. State Street has continued our track record of profitable growth and has maintained the strongest capital position among our closest peers. With the approval of the Federal Reserve and within the context of growing our business, we intend to continue to return capital to our shareholders.
