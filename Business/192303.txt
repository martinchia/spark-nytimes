HONG KONG â The head of a Chinese chemical company that was called a fraud last week in a short-selling research report responded on ThursdayÂ to what he called âfalsified information and blatantly untrue statements.â The comments by Xuan Wei, the chief executive of Tianhe Chemicals, were in response to a report published last week by Anonymous Analytics, a group that calls itself a faction of the hacking collective Anonymous. The report described Tianhe as âone of the largest stock market frauds ever conceived.â Tianhe said late on Wednesday that its email system had been hacked, possibly compromising the company’s continuing discussions with the Hong Kong stock exchange over the claims in the report. The company said it had decided to immediately issue the lengthy rebuttal, published on the website of the exchange.  Trading in Tianhe’s shares has been suspended since Sept. 2, when the report was released. The company has been listed only since June, when it raised about $650 million. âThe company unequivocally denies and vigorously refutes the groundless allegations in the report,â Tianhe said in the filing. âThe authors of the report have concealed themselves behind a shroud of anonymity with no information on their identity or background or their purported expert sources.â The attack on Tianhe, which makes specialty lubricant additives, comes amid an increase in activity among short-sellers betting on a drop in the shares of Chinese companies. This week, Carson C. Block of Muddy Waters Research announced a new short position on 500.com, a Chinese sports gambling website listed on Nasdaq. On Wednesday, the Trinity Research Group, another short-selling research company, published a report taking aim at 21 Vianet Group, a Chinese Internet data center services company, also listed on Nasdaq. But the report on Tianhe is notable because of the company’s size â a market value of about 59 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $7.6 billion â and its backers. Those include Morgan Stanleyâs Asian private equity unit, which invested $300 million in Tianhe in 2012. âWe stand resolutely behind Tianheâs world-class management team,â Homer Sun, the chief investment officer of the Morgan Stanley unit and a nonexecutive director of Tianhe, said on Thursday in a statement. Tianhe said it was still in discussions with the Hong Kong stock exchange â which doubles as the operator and a regulator of the city’s market â about the Anonymous Analytics report when it discovered on Wednesday that someone had hacked into its email system. The company said it released the rebuttal publicly because it had determined there was âan imminent risk of leakage of such communications which may result in further market rumors.â The shares remain suspended from trading, pending further discussions with the stock exchange. âI intend to draw a line under this matter as quickly as possible, and move on to what is important â continuing to grow one of the worldâs leading specialty chemical groups,â Mr. Wei, the chief executive, said in the filing.
