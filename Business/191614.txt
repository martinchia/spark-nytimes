Carl Richards is a certified financial planner in Park City, Utah. His new book, “The Behavior Gap,” was published earlier this year. His sketches are archived here on the Bucks blog.  Each year, many of us set resolutions to do (and be) better. We like the idea of improving ourselves, so we tell ourselves that because we want it badly, willpower alone is enough to see us through. We do this despite knowing that sticking to something takes discipline and patience. Frankly, it can be hard, and we often underestimate just how hard it will be. Think of all the information out there on diet and exercise. Eating well and exercising are not complex. We have all the information we need, but we still have a tough time doing it. The tendency to rely on willpower, the sheer grit-your-teeth-and-do-it sort of stuff, only works for a very small number of people, particularly when it comes to money. So what if we stopped relying on willpower and discipline alone to avoid bad money behavior? What if we simply automated good behavior? If youâre trying to eat well, you don’t bring a box of donuts home. So if youâre trying to save $100 a month for your child’s education, don’t force yourself to remake that decision ever month. Automate it. We have access to a lot of tools that make good money behavior automatic, so itâs ridiculous to not use them where possible. If we continue to rely solely on willpower, we will continue to get the same result: failed budgets and emotional decisions with our investments. Not every financial decision can be put on cruise control, but why are you fighting the same battle every single month if you donât have to? Here are three things you can do to take some of the headache out of good money behavior: 1) Portfolio Rebalancing One of the easiest and most overlooked automation options is portfolio rebalancing. I’ve written about this in the past, but I’m still amazed at how many people overlook this really powerful tool. By choosing to have your portfolio rebalanced automatically you reduce significantly the odds that you’ll buy high and sell low. 2) Automatic Savings Most accounts now allow for automatic savings each month. It may be a service offered by your employer that splits a check between two accounts or your bank may offer the option to transfer automatically a set amount from checking to savings each month. Whatever the option, sign up for it. 3) Automatic Payments For set payments, things like your mortgage or car loan, consider setting up automatic payments. Since most systems allow you to set the date of payment, you can time the withdrawal from your account to make sure that you never get hit with late fees or feel the bite of extra interest. By automating specific financial decisions, you’ll lessen the temptation to cheat. For instance, if you have to remake the decision to rebalance every time the market fluctuates, it will be incredibly hard to sell when stocks reach all-time highs or not liquidate your portfolio if the market takes a nose dive. If you have to physically transfer money to savings each month, there will be months that you tell yourself it’s O.K. to skip. The emotions around money are so enormous and often so complicated that the more we can do to automate good behavior, the better off we’ll be in the long run.
