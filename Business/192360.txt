LONDON — British and American regulators on Thursday fined a small British brokerage firm more than $2 million over misconduct related to the manipulation of global interest rate benchmarks known as Libor. The firm, RP Martin, agreed to pay $1.2 million in penalties to settle accusations by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission related to the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, as it was tied to the Japanese yen. RP Martin was also fined 630,000 pounds, or about $1 million, by the Financial Conduct Authority of Britain related to conduct by employees at its Martin Brokers unit. The authority said that the fine could have been as much as Â£3.6 million, but that the brokerage unit demonstrated it could not pay a penalty of that amount in addition to the other regulatory fine it faced. âTodayâs action is part of our ongoing efforts to ensure that the Libor rate is free of fraud and manipulation,â Gretchen L. Lowe, acting director of the C.F.T.C.âs enforcement division, said in a statement. âThis action reflects the commissionâs unwavering commitment to hold those who seek to undermine the integrity of the U.S. financial markets responsible for their actions.â Libor helps determine the borrowing costs for trillions of dollars in loans, credit cards and mortgages. The investigation by American, British and other regulators into its manipulation in London, New York and Tokyo has ensnared a number of large global institutions, including Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS. RP Martin assisted a trader at the Swiss bank UBS in his efforts to manipulate Libor as it was tied to the yen, including making misleading recommendations to RP Martin employees who made submissions used in the setting of Libor, British and American regulators said. In exchange, the RP Martin brokers accepted payments of more than $400,000, through so-called wash trades that were intended solely to generate commissions for the brokerage firm. âThe culture at Martins was that profit came first,â said Tracey McDermott, the British authorityâs director of enforcement and financial crime. âCompliance was seen as a hindrance, and the firm lacked the means to detect the âwash trades.â In this environment, broker misconduct was almost inevitable.â RP Martin brokers were also accused of submitting nonexistent cash bids, known as âspoofâ bids to their clients, in hopes that they might influence the yen Libor to the benefit of the UBS trader. The conduct continued after the trader left UBS, the United States regulator said. As part of the settlement, RP Martin agreed to strengthen internal controls related to the setting of benchmark interest rates. The regulators did not name the RP Martin brokers or the UBS trader in the statement. Two former RP Martin brokers, Terry J. Farr and James A. Gilmour, are facing criminal charges in Britain related to Libor manipulation. They are accused of conspiring with employees at a number of banks, including Tom A. W. Hayes, a former Citigroup and UBS trader. Mr. Farr, Mr. Gilmour and Mr. Hayes have pleaded not guilty and are set to go on trial in Britain next year. All told, 12 people are facing criminal charges in Britain, including six former employees of the British bank Barclays, which became the first bank to reach a settlement in the matter nearly two years ago. Separately, American authorities have brought criminal charges against several of those people, including Mr. Hayes. British prosecutors have said they have identified as many as 22 people as potential co-conspirators in the investigation, but have named only the 12 people charged criminally. In a statement, RP Martin said that its new senior management team cooperated fully with American and British regulators in their investigations and âentirely respect the fine and sanctions imposed.â âOver the last 12 months, the board comprehensively restructured the firmâs governance, systems and controls, and compliance procedures,â the company said.
