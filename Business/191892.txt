Earning a doctorate while working as a teaching assistant sounds like a great deal: Get your Ph.D. for free! And in many ways, it is a good deal. But graduate students who have their degrees fully financed typically work hard in exchange for that money, often toiling long hours while pursuing their own studies, as I learned while reporting an article for the Education Life section. You probably remember teaching assistants from your college days: older students who helped make clear what was blurry after a big, hourlong lecture, coaching you in discussion groups to unlock the meaning of âParadise Lost.â Most doctoral students rely heavily on their assistantships, essentially a type of merit-based financial support, to pay for their studies. These days, due to tight budgets and a slow academic job market, thereâs more competition for them. Students I interviewed on several campuses report that while theyâre generally able to get assistantships â T.A.’s, after all, are crucial to the functioning of a university â they sometimes have to scramble more than in the past. Elite schools dangle packages of financing, typically a mix of teaching assistantships and fellowships, to lure top students. If youâre truly an academic rock star, you still probably wonât pay a dime for your Ph.D., and you’ll be assured of a teaching assistant job upon admission. (Teaching assistantships generally come with a tuition waiver and a stipend, in exchange for part-time work helping to teach undergraduates.) But tight budgets have caused even some highly selective programs to shrink, meaning fewer doctoral students are admitted in the first place â especially in the humanities. The graduate students I interviewed are passionate about their studies and dedicated to their students. Yet some schools are opting instead to hire more lecturers or adjunct professors, who are cheaper because they donât need tuition waivers. If youâre already in the work force, you may want to take a look at another article in the section, which examines the costs and benefits of getting an executive M.B.A. These programs are tailored to working professionals. Take a look at the articles and let us know what you think. Is it worth it to be a T.A. these days? Or to pursue an executive M.B.A.?
