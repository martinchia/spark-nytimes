Seven former employees of Dewey & LeBoeuf who pleaded guilty to participating in a scheme to manipulate the law firmâs finances came from very different backgrounds than many of the high-powered lawyers at the once-prominent New York firm, Matthew Goldstein writes in DealBook. The employeesâ guilty pleas were unsealed on Thursday and Friday, revealing that none of the former employees was a lawyer and just one was a certified public accountant. Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, is relying on the testimony and cooperation of the seven former back-office employees to support a 106-count indictment filed this month against the law firmâs three top executives, all of whom are lawyers. The seven former employees, four of whom pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges, provided prosecutors with detailed statements outlining their role in the manipulation scheme. The indictment, approved by a New York grand jury, charged Steven H. Davis, Deweyâs former chairman; Stephen DiCarmine, the firmâs onetime executive director; and Joel Sanders, the firmâs former chief financial officer, with orchestrating a four-year scheme to manipulate the firmâs finances to keep Dewey in business and persuade investors and banks to provide it with badly needed financing. A low-level employee was also indicted. The unsealed pleas from the former employees reveal that most are prepared to provide testimony directly linking Mr. Sanders to accusations that the firm made improper year-end adjustments to its revenue and expenses and lied about those adjustments to the firmâs auditor, Ernst & Young.   COMCAST LOOKS BEYOND CABLE Â |Â  Four years ago, Reed Hastings, chief executive of the then-fledgling Netflix, questioned why his company would want to make a deal with Comcast, which he called âa regional cable company.â If Comcastâs chief executive, Brian Roberts, has his way, his company will soon be neither regional nor cable, James B. Stewart writes in the Common Sense column. Mr. Stewart writes: âWith its aggressive push into broadband Internet and its bold acquisition of NBC Universal, Comcast already is no longer just a cable company. If its proposed $45 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable is approved by regulators, it wonât be regional, either.â And, he notes, Netflix agreed last month to pay Comcast for faster and more reliable broadband delivery of its streaming service âin a potentially groundbreaking deal between a content provider and a broadband distributor.â This may be just the beginning. Mr. Roberts sees the new Comcast as a global technology company and its major competitors the media companies of the future, which include Google, Amazon and Facebook. But whether Comcast can become a force in New York now lies with regulators at the Justice Department, who are looking into antitrust issues related to the Time Warner Cable deal, and at the Federal Communications Commission, which is examining broader public policy issues.   TOO BIG TO CARE? Â |Â  Vindu Goel writes in the Bits blog: âFacebookâs chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has always followed his own instincts when making decisions about the company he founded 10 years ago. But several events over the last week make you wonder: Has the company gotten so successful that it doesnât care what other people think about it?” The question was raised after Facebookâs announcement last week that it would pay more than $2 billion in cash and stock to buy Oculus VR, a start-up that makes virtual reality headsets. After the Oculus deal, Facebookâs stock fell more than 7 percent, but, Mr. Goel writes, âMr. Zuckerberg has voting control over the company, so he can simply ignore Wall Street as he pursues his vision of the companyâs future.â Facebook also reacted unsympathetically to an announcement on Thursday by Eat24, an online food ordering service, that it would shut down its Facebook page on Monday.

A LONE RANGER OF THE 401(K)âS Â |Â  Hidden fees can make it hard for 401(k) holders to find out what they are paying for their plans. Of course, plan sponsors have a fiduciary duty to safeguard workersâ retirement accounts, but these sponsors do not always push providers like mutual funds to reduce fees or cut costs. Now this may be about to change, Gretchen Morgenson writes in the Fair Game column. Jerome J. Schlichter, a partner at the law firm Schlichter Bogard & Denton in St. Louis, has had a string of cases that highlight a corporate responsibility to monitor the costs and fees in employeesâ retirement plans. Since he began suing companies over fiduciary failures eight years ago, he has settled six 401(k) cases, generating $125 million in recoveries to 300,000 participants, minus legal fees, and secured major reductions in plan costs for the future. Five more cases filed by Mr. Schlichter are pending; one was dismissed. Each case differs, but most involve high and often hidden fees levied on 401(k) participants. âThe good news for all 401(k) holders is that Mr. Schlichterâs cases are gaining traction in the courts,â Ms. Morgenson writes, adding, âBattles against 401(k) plan sponsors that are somnambulant or worse are bringing a much-needed spotlight to questionable practices in these plans. But one small law firm can do only so much.â  MICHAEL LEWIS TAKES AIM AT HIGH-SPEED TRADERS Â |Â  The author Michael Lewis, whose new book, âFlash Boys,â is scheduled to be released on Monday, argued on â60 Minutesâ on Sunday evening that the United States stock market was âriggedâ in favor of high-speed traders, William Alden writes in DealBook. In his new book, Mr. Lewis â the author of popular books like âLiarâs Poker,â âThe Big Shortâ and âThe Blind Sideâ â follows the story of Brad Katsuyama, a former trader at the Royal Bank of Canada who helped create a system to slow down customersâ orders to thwart high-frequency traders, Nathaniel Popper wrote in DealBook last year. Mr. Katsuyama now runs a new trading platform called IEX, which is designed to be inhospitable to âpredatoryâ high-frequency traders.
