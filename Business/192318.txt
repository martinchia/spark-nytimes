Jennifer Taub is a professor at Vermont Law School. Her book âOther Peopleâs Housesâ  was published in May by Yale Press. Filed before dawn on Sept. 15, 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. spread panic through the financial system. Within hours of the filing that Monday morning, what should have been the contained demise of a venerable investment house turned into a widespread financial crisis.  That part is old news. But what still deserves attention are these questions: What actually precipitated Lehman’s collapse, how did the contagion spread from the firm to the credit markets  and broader economy, and has this problem been fixed?  A direct cause of Lehman’s failure, and its spread to the credit markets, was money market funds. Yes, those rather dull vehicles that allow investors to redeem their shares dollar-for-dollar, played a central role in Lehman’s and other banks’ failures, and subsequent government bailouts.  In September 2008, more than $3 trillion was invested in money market funds. Some of these funds hold only short-term United States government securities, others short-term municipal debt. A third type, “prime” funds, have portfolios that include short-term corporate debt. The trouble six years ago was with the prime funds. Prime money market funds provided short-term (often overnight) financing to banks, including Lehman. This allowed the banks to load up on a range of assets. These assets would then serve as collateral. Collateral types varied and included toxic mortgage-linked securities, the worth of which depended upon ever-rising home prices. After the housing bubble burst, the value of this collateral declined. Let’s recall. One week before it failed, Lehman owed an astonishing $200 billion in overnight “repo” loans. Some large money market funds and other wholesale lenders, nervous about the mortgage-linked collateral backing those loans, demanded their cash. Short of a government-backed rescue, Lehman was done for.  Unlike those fast-acting repo lenders that protected themselves (and their own investors) by bringing Lehman to its knees, other short-term creditors that did not run on Lehman were infected. These included the Reserve Primary Fund. Reserve Primary held about $785 million in short-term loans and other debt issued by Lehman, all worthless after Lehman’s failure. Though that was a small percentage of Reserve Primary’s total $62 billion portfolio, its panicked investors pulled $40 billion from the money market fund in the two days after Lehman went under. After the market closed on Tuesday, Sept. 16, the sponsor announced that Reserve Primary “broke the buck” and was now valued at 97 cents a share.  The failure of Reserve Primary inspired a huge run on other money market funds. These vehicles had been thought of as a higher-yielding, but equally safe, alternative to a bank account. Not anymore. Nervous investors redeemed $300 billion in cash that week alone.  To honor redemption requests, many of the money market funds had to rapidly sell off holdings and horde cash. This meant that they did not renew or âroll overâ hundreds of billions of dollars in financing needed by banks and other businesses.  To stop the run on the money market funds, the government stepped in on the Thursday of Lehman week. The Fed used its emergency authority to make loans to banks so that they could buy up the assets the money market funds were shedding. On Friday of that week, the Treasury Department announced that it would temporarily guarantee the $1 net asset value for money market fund shares. These moves stopped the run, but they were unprecedented: the taxpayers were now standing behind the performance of an investment product. Today, the problems remain unsolved. Giant banks and broker dealers are still vulnerable to the sudden withdrawal of short-term financing by money market funds and other wholesale lenders. And despite two sets of new rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission — one in 2010 and the other in 2014 — investors in money market funds still have reasons to run with their cash at the first hint of trouble. The most recent rule, issued in July, squeaked through on a 3-to-2 vote. It requires that within two years, all prime and municipal money market funds sold to institutional investors have a floating net asset value. In contrast, all types of retail money market funds, (which in total hold nearly $1 trillion in assets), will still be allowed to maintain the $1 price, as will government money market funds sold to institutional investors. The rule also allows the boards of money market funds to impose fees and redemption gates on their funds to discourage or block investor redemptions during times of stress. In certain circumstances, the rule requires the imposition of liquidity fees. In separate statements, the two dissenting commissioners, Kara Stein, a Democrat, and Michael Piwowar, a Republican, highlighted the rule’s shortcomings.   Ms. Stein suggested that “gates are the wrong tool to address” investor flight risk.  She cautioned that “as the chance that a gate will be imposed increases, investors will have a strong incentive to rush to redeem ahead of others to avoid the uncertainty of losing access to their capital.” What’s worse, investors shut out from one troubled fund, may then turn to other funds to redeem cash out of “fear that they also will impose gates,” resulting in a “systemwide run.”  It is also questionable whether the floating price for prime institutional funds will substantially eliminate the advantage of the early redemptions or stem runs. In 2008, ultra-short bond funds (that have floating values) experienced comparable redemptions to stable-price money market funds. Ms. Stein and Mr. Piwowar shared an area of concern. They noted that the rule does not address the financial institutions’ over-reliance on short-term wholesale funding, whether from money market funds or other sources.  Alternatives exist. Consider a recent academic paper by Jill Fisch. a University of Pennsylvania law professor, entitled “The Broken Buck Stops Here: Embracing Sponsor Support in Money Market Fund Reform.”  Professor Fisch would require that sponsors of money market funds be required to guarantee the $1 share price. She points out that the reason money market funds rarely break the buck is because of  voluntary, behind-the-scenes, sponsor support. Under Professor Fisch’s proposal, this support would come “out of the shadows” and could take a variety of forms.  She makes several suggestions. Money market fund sponsors, she said, “could waive advisory fees, in whole or in part, to prevent the fund from experiencing a negative yield,” or “sponsors could commit up front to provide support through an explicit guarantee or letter of credit or could purchase private insurance to cover any potential liability.” Alternatively, she said, “a sponsor could, if a fund experiences financial weakness, provide liquidity by purchasing assets at par.”  All money market funds, in other words, whether offered to institutional or retail investors, could maintain a stable net asset value if the sponsor provided the guarantee. Without the guarantee, the net asset value would have to float.  It’s an idea worthy of consideration, but now that the S.E.C. has issued a final rule, money market reform looks to be crossed off the to-do list. Yet this proposal may yet have its day. If the government is once again needed to stop the contagion when another fund breaks the buck, it will be time to mandate that sponsors, not taxpayers, back the buck. Advertisement
