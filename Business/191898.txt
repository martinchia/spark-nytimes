Transocean, one of the world’s largest offshore drilling contractors, said on Monday that it had bid $1.43 billion for Aker Drilling of Norway to expand its fleet by adding rigs and ships. Transocean, which owned the rig lost in the oil spill disaster last year in the Gulf of Mexico, said it agreed to pay 26.5 Norwegian kroner ($4.80) in cash for each Aker share. The offer price is 62 percent higher than Akerâs average share price over 30 days before the offer, Transocean said in a statement. Transocean would also assume $800 million of Akerâs debt. With the acquisition, Transocean would gain two ultra-deepwater rigs that are on long-term contracts in Norway to Statoil and Det Norske. It would also get two drillships that are currently being built at a shipyard in South Korea. Transocean would have to pay $900 million for the ships upon delivery. “Aker Drilling is an excellent strategic fit for Transocean,” the company president and chief executive, Steven L. Newman, said in a statement. “It allows us to enhance our position in Norway where we have enjoyed a long-term presence and excellent customer relationships.” Transocean said it would finance the bid with existing cash and debt, and that the acquisition was expected to be immediately accretive to Transoceanâs earnings.  The board of Aker Drilling unanimously recommended the bid to its shareholders, Transocean said. Aker Drilling’s shareholders are expected to vote on the offer later this month. Morgan Stanley and Fearnley Fonds/Fearnley Offshore advised Transocean on the bid. Wikborg Rein provided legal advice. Advertisement
