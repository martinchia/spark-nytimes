Robert Moir, 42, joined Merrill Lynch in 1997. On Sept. 11, 2001, he was a business manager for NASDAQ Trading. He is now a managing director and chief operating officer of the Americas cash equity sales and trading at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. On Sept. 11, 2001, I was working for Merrill Lynch on the equity trading floor at 4 World Financial Center.  It seemed typical to any other morning until we heard what sounded like a large truck crash. Curious to see what had happened, we ran to the windows to find a large amount of paper tickets falling to the ground.  Since we were on a lower floor, we could only see up to the 20th floor or so of the twin towers and didnât have the full understanding of what had happened until we turned around and saw the coverage across every television on the trading floor.  After staring at the screen for a few minutes, we realized we were close enough to the scene that we could go outside and look at it firsthand, given it was literally happening across the street. As we headed down and the elevator doors opened, we found pure panic — people were yelling and screaming at the top of their lungs and running in all directions.  At that moment, we learned that a second plane had hit the second tower. Workers suddenly began pouring out of surrounding buildings, including ours, and I and a handful of colleagues started walking north up the West Side Highway. As I was walking away from the building I turned to my colleagues and said, âThis changes everything.â I knew that things would never be the same.   By the time we reached 14th Street, we heard that the towers had fallen. In the days that followed, I was particularly eager to get back to work. I needed a healthy distraction, something to focus on other than the news reports, devastation and heartbreak that the attacks left behind. So when I received the call to help set up a backup trading floor for Merrill Lynch in Jersey City, I was eager to help. The following day, I reported to the Herzog Building in Jersey City, as Merrill had recently acquired Herzog Heine Geduld and we had made arrangements to share their office space in Jersey City for the next several weeks. We were tasked with constructing a scaled-down trading floor and worked with Herzog to find desks, computers and phones — all the essentials traders needed to do their job. We clearly wouldn’t have all of the luxuries that come with modern trading technology. Once we were operational, we had to make due with the limited resources we had. Every order had a paper ticket attached, and an operations person would have to manually key it in. We didnât have electronic merchandising boards, so we used dry erase boards and called out orders to someone who was charged with writing them on the board to advertise them to the floor. We were resourceful and made it work because we knew we had to. We knew we couldnât let terrorism win. We were doing our part to fight back. The opponentsâ goal was to cripple the United States economy, and we werenât going to let that happen. There was a tremendous sense of pride in our firm, in our industry and in our country, and we werenât going to let anyone bring us down. Advertisement
