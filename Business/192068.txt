The private equity owners of Kinder Morgan — Goldman Sachs, Highstar Capital, the Carlyle Group and Riverstone Holdings are selling shares in the I.P.O., while  Kinder Morgan’s management is not.  Kinder Morgan was taken private in 2007 in a $22 billion buyout led by the company’s founder, Richard Kinder.
