E.U. IMPOSES FINES FOR RATE-FIXING  |  The European Union has fined a group of global financial institutions a combined 1.7 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in a landmark accord over alleged collusion to fix two benchmark interest rates, The New York Times reports. The agreement, announced by European Union antitrust officials on Wednesday, relates to actions by traders at some of the worldâs largest banks, including Citigroup, Royal Bank of Scotland and Deutsche Bank, who were accused of fixing rates for the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, as it relates to the Japanese yen and the euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor. 

AN UNEXPECTED APOLOGY STOKES A FEUD  |  A major grudge match on Wall Street flared up recently â after an emailed apology from one of the parties, DealBookâs Susanne Craig reports. The grudge originated two years ago, when Sean Egan, the managing director of the upstart credit ratings agency Egan-Jones, cut the rating on the investment bank Jefferies and criticized the firm on television, sending its stock into a tailspin. Wall Street was already on edge at the time, with MF Global, the commodities brokerage firm, having just filed for bankruptcy.
Richard B. Handler, the chief executive of Jefferies, went on the counterattack, arguing that the analystâs report was littered with inaccuracies. In particular, Mr. Handler noted that the report said 77 percent of the firmâs shareholder equity was invested in the same bonds that took down MF Global while failing to mention that Jefferies had hedged the position, which more than offset its exposure. Jefferies stock eventually rebounded and Mr. Handler thought he had seen the last of Mr. Egan. But a few weeks ago, he got a surprising email.
âI would like to apologize for harm caused to you,â Mr. Egan wrote. 
Ms. Craig writes: âReconciliation can be difficult on Wall Street, a pressure cooker where big egos and long memories can nurse feuds and fuel animosity for years. In this case, it wasnât made easier by the fact that Mr. Egan, 56, is something of an outsider on Wall Street, while Mr. Handler, 52, a former trader at the bond powerhouse Drexel Burnham Lambert, is one of its longest-serving players. This account is based on the exchange of emails, and interviews with a number of people at the two firms.â



VOLCKER RULE APPROACHES FINISH LINE  |  âFederal regulators have reached a tentative agreement to complete a rule aimed at Wall Street risk-taking, federal officials said on Tuesday, overcoming internal squabbling and an onslaught of Wall Street lobbying that stymied them for years,â DealBookâs Ben Protess reports.
âFive federal agencies plan to approve a tougher-than-expected version of the so-called Volcker Rule next week, eking out passage before the year is up and providing Wall Street with some much-sought clarity. While the vote for the complex rule will come more than a year after a congressional deadline passed, it still will meet the recommendation of Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, who urged the federal agencies to finish writing the rule in 2013.
âThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, one of the five agencies, announced on Tuesday that it would vote on Dec. 10. Three other agencies â the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency â also announced plans to approve the rule on Dec. 10. The final agency involved in the rule, the Securities and Exchange Commission, has said it will vote on or about that date.â



USING A LEGAL LOOPHOLE IN BID TO CONTROL A RIVAL  |  Charles W. Ergen, in his quest to take over LightSquared, âhas once again shown that sometimes money and smarts can run circles around the letter if not the spirit of the law,â Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column.
LightSquared, the broadband wireless company controlled by Philip Falconeâs hedge fund, Harbinger Capital Partners, faltered when the Federal Communications Commission stymied its effort to beam fourth-generation wireless Internet access across America. That was when Mr. Ergen and his satellite television company, Dish Network, pounced, having noticed a flaw in LightSquaredâs debt documents. âThe documents were written to prevent a âdirect competitorâ of the company from acquiring its debt. This meant that Dish could not buy up the debt, but whoever controlled the debt would be in prime position to acquire the company if LightSquared filed for bankruptcy,â Mr. Davidoff writes.
âSo Mr. Ergen, a former poker player, had his hedge fund, Sound Point Capital Management, arrange for a second company he owns to acquire roughly $1 billion worth of LightSquaredâs $1.75 billion in outstanding debt.â

KOZLOWSKI IS GRANTED PAROLE  |  L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of Tyco International, is nearing the end of his long tenure in New York Stateâs penitentiary system, DealBookâs Michael J. de la Merced reports. The stateâs Board of Parole granted parole to Mr. Kozlowski after an interview on Tuesday morning, a spokeswoman for the corrections department said. He will be formally released as soon as Jan. 17. In a statement, a lawyer for Mr. Kozlowski said his client was âgratefulâ to the parole board.
This was Mr. Kozlowskiâs second attempt to win parole, after the state board denied his first application in April of last year, deeming his release not âcompatible with the welfare of society at large.â  He will now take another step toward freedom, more than eight years after he was found guilty of essentially using Tyco as his own piggy bank.
