 A jury in St. Louis decided that Anheuser-Busch did not discriminate against a former executive by paying her less than a male predecessor. The jury of seven women and five men sided with the beer maker, now owned by the Belgian brewer InBev. Counting bonuses and stock options, Francine Katz earned about $1 million annually after her 2002 promotion to vice president for communications and consumer affairs. But Ms. Katz’s base salary was half that of John Jacob, a board member. The company said her compensation compared favorably with those in similar positions at other large corporations, and that Mr. Jacob had more responsibilities. In a 20-year career, Ms. Katz, now 56, rose from a young corporate lawyer to the beer maker’s top female executive. A version of this brief appears in print on May 17, 2014, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Anheuser-Busch Is Found Not Guilty of Bias.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
