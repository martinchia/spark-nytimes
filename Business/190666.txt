Paul Sagan, a former chief executive of Akamai Technologies, is starting a new chapter as a venture capitalist. Mr. Sagan has been named a partner at General Catalyst Partners, the venture capital firm announced on Thursday. With the title XIR — âX-factor in residenceâ — he will act as a hands-on adviser to young companies in which General Catalyst is invested. After eight years at the helm of Akamai, a cloud technology company catering to businesses, Mr. Sagan, 54, wanted to get back to working with smaller companies, he said. He stepped down as chief executive early last year, but will continue to service as vice chairman of Akamaiâs board. “Money is the easy thing to get right now. Itâs ideas and mentorshipâ that are harder to come by, Mr. Sagan said. Founded in 2000 and based in Cambridge, Mass., General Catalyst has invested in a diverse range of technology companies, including Airbnb, Kayak, Warby Parker and Snapchat. Mr. Sagan said he would be focused on the “intersection of Internet, technology, hyperconnectivity and how it changes businesses.” His worked with General Catalyst last year, investing alongside the firm in a $25 million financing round in Datto, a start-up that provides data backup and continuity services. David Fialkow, a managing director at General Catalyst, said that Mr. Saganâs presence in the deal was critical in getting it done. “I do not think the founder of Datto would have taken an outside investor had that investor not had Paul Sagan as part of the team,â Mr. Fialkow, 55, said. The XIRs at General Catalyst are more than just advisers, Mr. Fialkow said. They can serve as chief executive or chairman at portfolio companies, bringing their experience to bear on day-to-day challenges. Mr. Fialkow described their role this way: “Holy smokes, this person is bringing something to that entrepreneur-founder that otherwise that founder would never get.â Advertisement
