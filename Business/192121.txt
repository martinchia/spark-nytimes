If you were an arbitrager in Airgas hoping against the odds that the Delaware Chancery Court would provide a Christmas present, you would likely be disappointed.  A teleconference hearing was held on Monday in the lawsuit brought by Air Product and Chemicals seeking to have the Delaware court redeem Airgasâ poison pill. At that hearing, Chancellor William B. Chandler III informed the parties that he would be on vacation through the New Year and that he was not âgoing to give any decision until the first of the year, the New Year.â  Chancellor Chandler also noted he would be working on the decision during that time.   The delay, if it really is one, is not surprising. The judge was unlikely to rule until Airgas had responded to Air Products’ latest offer. It has yet to do so, and while the federal securities laws require a prompt response, Airgas clearly has some internal matters it needs to sort through before the board can decide.  In the wake of this teleconference, Chancellor Chandler circulated a letter on Tuesday to the parties (see below). From the letter, it appears that Chancellor Chandler is skeptical of Airgasâ argument that the whole case is moot because the trial concerned an offer of $65.50 per share and Air Products is now offering $70 per share.  He invites Air Products to submit a full response to this argument and quotes Air Productsâ lawyer to ask whether this was all one âbig âmoot court exercise.ââ The judge also poses new questions to Airgas.  His questions are:     (1) When exactly does the Airgas board intend to make its determination on the $70 offer; and
    (2) Although I understand Airgasâs position . . . .  I do ask (once more) the likely date (or even the âwindow of opportunityâ) for the 2011 Airgas annual meeting, given that the law of Delaware now requires the 2008 Airgas directors to stand for reelection approximately three years after their initial election.
 Chancellor Chandler also throws in another dig at the Supreme Courtâs decision in this case holding that Airgasâ annual meeting date should be within a year of the last one. He states sarcastically that the âthe arithmetical calculation of this date (now required under Delaware law) should, I assume, be clear to someone.â So, for those who are rooting for Chancellor Chandler to order the poison pill redeemed, this letter may give you hope.  Chancellor Chandler concludes the letter by stating that: Depending on the responses that I receive, I also may decide to grant plaintiffs and defendants an abbreviated discovery window as well as provide counsel with an opportunity for oral argument with respect to whether or not the $70 offer is a threat.
 Whatever your opinion, the judge clearly is setting up his decision to avoid a mootness ruling.  It is also clear that Airgas now has a decision on whether to hold firm or move its meeting date to June.  I suspect that it will not bite and continue to either be vague on the date or say in September.  After their surprising win in the Supreme Court, Airgas likely thinks that it has the Supreme Court in its pocket on this case, even if Chancellor Chandler rules against it.   But he is forging ahead on the issue of whether a poison pill can be used to fight off a fairly priced offer, if indeed $70 a share is fair. This will depend in large part on what the Airgas board decides in the next week or so.    The judgeâs poison pill ruling may turn on the boardâs view of the Airgas offer at this point, including the independent directors. The weight of the case-law is against redeeming the pill, so Airgas will need to be careful here not to provide Chancellor Chandler the ammunition he may be seeking. If Chancellor Chandler does order the pill redeemed, he is going to need to do it based on a factual finding that would stand reversal. Airgas and its board and management will need to be quite careful in the next few weeks.  Chandler Letter  Advertisement
