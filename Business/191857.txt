Few executives in the technology world love a good fight more than Lawrence J. Ellison.  And when it comes to its longtime rival, Hewlett-Packard, Oracle‘s voluble chief executive is more than happy to take his gloves off and brawl. So when Autonomy, a British software company that H.P. has agreed to buy for $11.7 billion, contended that it never seriously considered Oracle as a potential buyer, Mr. Ellison apparently could not resist taking a swing in public. In an unusual press release issued on Wednesday, Oracle took exception to comments made by Autonomy’s chief executive, Mike Lynch. Soon after the H.P. deal was announced, Oracle announced that it had turned down the chance to bid for Autonomy, citing a too-high asking price. Mr. Lynch went so far as to call Oracle’s account “inaccurate” and that he had nothing to do with an Autonomy adviser approaching Oracle about a potential deal. Oracle’s response: “Either Mr. Lynch has a very poor memory or he’s lying.” Here is a more specific recounting of events, according to Oracle: Mr. Lynch and his main adviser, Frank P. Quattrone, co-founder of Qatalyst Advisers, visited Oracle on April 1 at 11 a.m, meeting with the technology giant’s head of mergers, Douglas Kehring, and its president, Mark V. Hurd. The two Oracle executives told Mr. Lynch that at a then-current market value of $6 billion, Autonomy was already overpriced. Oracle’s poison-penned account ended with the taunt, “We still have his PowerPoint slides.” A representative for H.P. was not immediately available for comment. For Mr. Ellison, fighting with H.P. is a bit personal. He has picked on his troubled competitor time and again, especially after the rival’s board fired Mr. Hurd as chief executive after allegations of improper conduct. From an impassioned e-mail that Mr. Ellison sent to The New York Times shortly after his friend and tennis partner’s dismissal: “The H.P. board just made the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago,” Mr. Ellison wrote. “That decision nearly destroyed Apple and would have if Steve hadnât come back and saved them.” Advertisement
