The adventure of new ventures. In our recent article about the surprising number of Silicon Beach start-ups that have emerged from Myspaceâs tortured decline, there were two start-ups that we chose not to include, Gogobot, and Mango Health. Both were started by Myspace alumni and both have interesting missions, but these entrepreneurs headed north to Silicon Valley instead of staying in Los Angelesâs Silicon Beach. Gogobot was started by Travis Katz. He was one of the founders of Fox Interactive Media and joined Myspace right after it was acquired by News Corporation in 2006. Mr. Katz left Myspace in mid-2009, and the following year he introduced Gogobot, a travel site that uses social connections to personalize search results. âIt was a difficult decision to leave L.A.,â Mr. Katz said. âIt would have been much easier to start Gogobot there because I had the entire Myspace network, and itâs a great entrepreneurial culture.â  But Mr. Katz, a Stanford graduate, missed the Bay Area and wanted to see if there really were advantages to being in Silicon Valley while starting a company. âThere is a very strong network of people working in technology and a lot more density here,” he said. “Facebookâs offices are a mile and a half from us, so if I need to talk about something with our Facebook integration, I can drive over there and have lunch with them.â Mr. Katz said that, when he lived in Los Angeles, he often felt âmonths behind in understanding some of the most cutting-edge thinking in technology. In Silicon Valley you are immersed in it.â Gogobot taps into the vast amount of social data online thatâs tagged with locations â people checking in to tell the world where they are and uploading photographs of their travels, the things they did and where they stayed. âIt could be someone just posted something on Facebook about a hotel they stayed in when they were in London,” Mr. Katz said. “That may not be relevant to me today, but a year from now when Iâm in London, it will be. Gogobot basically crawls through all that geo-tagged data your friends have shared with you over time, organizes it and presents it back to you exactly when you need it.â He compares it to the way Pandora works for music and Tinder for dating. The number of visitors to the site has grown 260 percent year-over-year, according to August numbers from comScore, and it had 563,000 unique American visitors last month. The company has raised $19 million in two rounds (one of its investors is Googleâs Eric Schmidt) and revenue is generated primarily through commission fees on hotels and restaurants and to a lesser extent, from advertising. Gogobot has integrated OpenTable for restaurant reservations and has a partnership with HomeAway, a vacation rental site. Mr. Katz declined to disclose the company’s revenue. Jason Oberfest, entered a very different industry withÂ Mango Health. Mr. Oberfest, whoÂ  oversaw the developer platform at Myspace, left the company in the summer of 2009 and then went to work for ngmoco, a game-development company based in San Francisco. But in late 2011 he started thinking of ways to apply what he knew about mobile app development and game design to solving a medical problem â getting sick people to take their medication and manage their health care. âKeeping consumers on a prescribed treatment regimen is a $300 billion-a-year problem,â Mr. Oberfest said. That $300 billion is the cost of additional care required when patients donât stick to their treatment regimens. In January 2012, Mr. Oberfest left ngmoco to found Mango Health. He didnât go back to L.A. because he wanted to work with a few designers and engineers he knew in San Francisco, and his children were already in school there. The companyâs flagship app offers a number of services. It gives patients a way to check for potentially dangerous interactions between drugs (and supplements, too). The app contains a database of more than 11,000 prescription medications, over-the-counter medications and major nutritional supplements. It also notifies users when their medications are running low, prompting them to order a refill. Patients are motivated to take their medication and continue their treatments through a game on the app that rewards them for doing so with gift cards or a chance to donate to a favorite charity. âWe have found the principles of game design to be very effective in changing peopleâs behavior,â Mr. Oberfest said. âUsers schedule in the times they are supposed to take their medication and we send a push notification to remind them. If they respond to that correctly each day, they earn points.â The company raised $3.1 million in seed financing last year, and the app was introduced in April. Mr. Oberfest declined to disclose the company’s revenue but said it comes from advertisements from brands, like Target, that provide gift card rewards. Pharmacy retailers are interested in partnering with Mango, he said, because pharmacy customers tend to be very loyal â they have to come back regularly for refills â and because pharmacies tend to be a higher-margin business within a store. Those retailers pay a fee to be part of Mango Healthâs reward program. The company is also working with a few health care providers, health insurers and large employers that are interested in paying a per-member, perâmonth fee to Mango. âThatâs a very common pricing structure for the industry,” he said. “If we keep a patient or employee on track with their medication, they are less likely to have a catastrophic health event, and that keeps costs down for insurance companies and employers.â Despite lots of interest from health plans and large companies, Mr. Oberfest is ramping up slowly. âThatâs one thing I learned from Myspace,” he said. “Youâre only as good as your last partnership. I want to do a small number of partnerships exceptionally well and grow from there. I think thatâs the only way to be successful.â You can follow Eilene Zimmerman on Twitter.
