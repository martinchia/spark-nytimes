Telling the stories of women business owners. An elimination diet inspires Kimberly Dobbins to create an allergy-friendly snack bar company. In 2007, Kimberly Dobbins was working as director of global recruiting for Morningstar, the investment research company, when she took a paid six-week sabbatical â a perk the company offers its employees â to do some soul-searching. âWhile I was happy at work, I needed something more in my personal life,â said Ms. Dobbins, who had previously worked in human resources at Goldman Sachs. âI didnât know if it was volunteering or a hobby.â With the growing emphasis on health and wellness, Ms. Dobbins decided to enroll in weekend classes in dietary theory when she returned to Morningstar, which is based in Chicago. Around the same time, she concocted a homemade nutrition bar free of wheat, gluten, dairy, soy and refined sugars. To Ms. Dobbins’s surprise, the bar â made with nuts, honey, vanilla, sea salt and herbs or spices — was popular with friends and even her husband, Sean, a meat-and-potatoes guy. âAnd I thought, well, maybe thereâs an idea there,â she said of the snack, initially called “the Sabbaticals.” Ms. Dobbins renamed the product Simple Squares, but she wasnât ready to quit her day job yet. She thought sheâd make the bars in a commercial kitchen and sell them at farmers’ markets on weekends. âThat was going to be my new personal passion,â she said. But when she learned that the farmers’ markets required attendance, with penalties for no-shows, she decided against the idea. âIt wasnât worth the effort,â she said. So she decided to take a shot at Plan B: mass distribution.  When you donât know anything about the food industry, learning how to manufacture a snack bar while maintaining a full-time corporate job that requires travel to Britain and Australia isnât the easiest feat. Ms. Dobbins spent much of 2009 figuring out the process. First, she read the book âSell Your Specialty Foodâ by Stephen Hall, which covered the basics, and then she searched online for a manufacturer that would do a pilot run. Eventually, she contacted a food-processing plant run by Land OâLakes, the dairy company based in Minneapolis. âThey said, âWe donât normally work for companies unless they have $1 million in sales,ââ she said. âBut they were very kind.â The plant put her in touch with a consultant, also based in Minneapolis, who for $1,200 agreed to help Ms. Dobbins find a manufacturer, develop a business model and come up with a commercial recipe. The consultant flew to Chicago, and spent time with Ms. Dobbins at Kitchen Chicago, which rents shared kitchen space by the hour. âI brought my food processor and pots and pans,â she said. âIt was helpful for him to see how I made it so he could tell what equipment I needed.â The consultant found her a manufacturer, a family-run business in Oregon, willing to work with a start-up. In early 2010, while still working full-time at Morningstar, Ms. Dobbins spent about $2,500 on a pilot run, producing a batch of Simple Squares in individually wrapped plain packs. She had them shipped to a hotel in Anaheim, Calif., where she attended Natural Products Expo West that March. âThe night before the show started, my whole family was there to support me,â she recalled. âWe were putting stickers on these silver packages.â The trade expo was a success for Ms. Dobbins, who said she took a âton of orders.â She also âpounded the pavementâ in Chicago and persuaded natural stores and gyms to carry Simple Squares. Six weeks later, she said, âWe had a major snafu. All the bars started leaking oil.â The nuts were causing the leak, and Ms. Dobbins was forced to spend about eight months working with the manufacturer to refine the process. She hated losing the momentum from the expo, she said, but most customers were patient with the delay. At the end of 2010, she took a three-month leave of absence from Morningstar to prepare for Simple Squaresâ first official production run, this time with formal packaging — and to determine if she wanted to make the start-up her new career. âEverybody was saying, âDonât leave the corporate job. Look at all the perks and benefits,ââ she said. But the trial period cemented her desire to provide âa healthy alternative to whatâs out there.â She resigned from Morningstar in early 2011. Today, Ms. Dobbinsâ bars are sold in 2,500 stores, including Whole Foods and Fairway locations. Each year, she has tripled her sales, selling about 450,000 bars in 2013, generally in 12-packs that retail for about $30. She now employs two people full time and two part time to help with sales, accounting and business development. About a year-and-a-half ago, Ms. Dobbins began working with large distributors to get the product into retail chains, and she hired a broker to communicate with the distributors. âItâs driving the growth of the business,â she said. Even so, Simple Squares is still just breaking even. Ms. Dobbins estimates that the company will finally turn a profit this fall — seven years after her Morningstar sabbatical. She spent about $50,000 to get Simple Squares up and running, she said, and she continues to bootstrap the company with savings from her corporate career. She plans to seek financing from a bank or investors. Entrepreneurship, she said, âis 5,000 times more challenging than I thought it would be.â Colleen DeBaise is director of digital media for The Story Exchange, a nonprofit media organization dedicated to telling the stories of women who own businesses.
