What small-business owners think. When e-commerce retailers try to drive sales by introducing affiliate marketing programs, they frequently contract outside program managers to help them recruit the best affiliates and to ferret out the coupon abusers, the âcookie-stuffers,â and the other unsavory characters who drive up their commission costs and erode their bottom lines (the subject of a small-business guide just published by The Times). Sometimes, however, outside program managers come across suspicious behavior that defies even their best attempts to prove that a merchant is being cheated by its affiliates. Thatâs when many call on Kellie Stevens, who was chosen by the industry as its 2009 Affiliate Marketing âLegend of the Yearâ and is perhaps its best-known “affiliate vigilante.” From a spare bedroom strewn with computer monitors and cables in her New Orleans home, she combs through thousands of lines of code a week searching for clues to the latest scams. âItâs a constant game of cat and mouse,â said Ms. Stevens, who markets her own services under the name AffiliateFairPlay.com and has been on the beat for more than a dozen years. The following interview has been condensed and edited. How did you get into this line of work? I fell into it, really. I used to be a physical therapist, but in 1999 I was having some health problems, so I started a little e-commerce business from home selling alternative therapy products. In the course of that, I joined one of the early affiliate networks to see if it could help me increase my sales. At the time, everyone was talking about this one affiliate who was making a lot of money, so I installed their adware to check them out. Then a few days later I just happened to go on my own site, and this message popped up: âYou can get a discount on this product by clicking here.â And I was, like, âNo, I canât,â and I immediately realized what they were up to. When I called the attorney generalâs office in Louisiana, they said I wasnât the first person who had called to complain about this sort of practice, but they didnât know of any legal action I could take. I said, âReally? How can this not be illegal? If I had a store and someone stood outside with a sign grabbing my customers to take a cut of my sales, they wouldnât be able to get away with that. But youâre telling me this is O.K.?â So, I started talking about it in online forums and the next thing I know people are coming to me asking me questions and things kind of took off from there. Whatâs the most devious case you have cracked lately? It would have to be the guy who was cookie-stuffing with a smiley face. This guy was hanging out in the online chat forums for major brands like Apple and Blackberry, posting these jokey little comments like any other engaged member of the community, except at the end of his posts instead of using the usual smiley face icon provided on the site he was using a cookie-stuffer in the shape of a smiley face. All someone had to do was read his post with his fake smiley face, and theyâd get a cookie stuffed on their browser that gave this guy credit for any purchases they made at hundreds of sites around the Web. He had a whole army of people working for him. I know because, once I figured out what he was doing, I did a deep Google on him and I found multiple projects heâd advertised on outsourcing sites where he was offering to pay people to post comments on the chat forums for him. He claimed in the ads it was just to help with the search engine optimization for his own site, but in reality he was hiring all these people to carry out his dirty work. Heâs actually still at it! The client who hired me to get to the bottom of the scam cut their ties with him, but Iâm sure lots of other merchants are still being played. Are there any practices that especially concern you? Iâm seeing more and more âbundled installs.â They first came to my attention because a client said that some of his employees went in and used their own site one day and saw a strange display ad at the top of the home page. Somehow one of their affiliates had not only cookie-stuffed their customers, but had installed a software application on their site so that anyone who received the cookie and visited their domain would see a banner ad for his site. I think thatâs really insidious. In going after some of these characters, do you ever worry for your safety? Not really. I only had someone knock on my door once. I do steer clear of the Russian mafia, though. If Iâm working on a case and come across any code that leads to a Russian IP address, I leave it alone. I donât need that kind of trouble.  Do you ever feel that affiliate marketing programs are more hassle than they’re worth? No, because there are way more good, honest affiliate marketers than bad. And itâs actually gotten better. Thereâs more awareness today among merchants than there was when I first started, which has helped to clean things up quite a bit. The problem is thereâs still a little of this attitude in the industry of looking the other way when the numbers are really good. As long the merchants are satisfied the affiliates seem to be bringing them a lot of traffic,Â  networks and program managers are still willing to suspend belief sometimes about where all that traffic is really coming from — because they’re making money too. At our trade shows, the sites with the most abuse going on are like the cool kids. Theyâre the ones throwing the big parties, because theyâre making the most money and other people want in on that. But Iâd argue that attitude gives the whole industry a black eye. What advice would you offer a beginner? First get up to speed on the best practices for running an affiliate program and then launch your program. Too many businesses just sign up with a network and turn on the switch, and then they wonder why they have a mess on their hands. Affiliate marketing can be very profitable, the return on investment can be terrific, but it has to be done correctly. You're the Boss offers an insider's perspective on small-business ownership.
