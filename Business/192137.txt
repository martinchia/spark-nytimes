Itâs no secret that this is a lousy time to try to sell your business. Inc. magazine recently published its â2010 Business Valuation Guide,â an annual feature that provides a glimpse into the current state of the business-for-sale marketplace. The article highlights the volume of small-business transactions, provides some average multiples, and offers comparisons to the prior year. The picture isn’t pretty. Small-business deal flow has slowed to a snailâs pace as sellers wait for improvement in both valuations and the performance of their enterprises. When I spoke recently with two representatives from Business Valuation Resources, the company that provides Inc. with the data for its feature, I caught them just as they were updating their database with 300 new deals. What follows is the most recent count for small businesses purchased by either public or private buyers:  Year Deals Done 2007Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1,567 2008Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1,682 2009Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1,018 2010Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  861 (year to date) âDeal flow is worse than down. It is nearly dead,â said Toby Tatum, a business broker and certified business appraiser in Nevada. As with many aspects of the recent recession, Main Street businesses have beenÂ  hardest hit. According to Adam Manson, an analyst at BVR, âacquisitions are recovering more favorably for companies with revenues over $5 million.â When expressed as a multiple of revenue, sale prices for small businesses over all have been on a downward trend, with companies selling for an average of .52 times net sales in 2008 and .48 times net sales in 2009. Smaller companies, however, with revenue under $1 million, sold for an average of .29 times net sales in 2009 according to data pulled by Mr. Tatum using the BizComps database. If now is an extremely difficult time to sell your business, perhaps it is also a good time to revisit the basics of what makes a business sell in the first place. While many blame the tight capital markets for their woes, Mr. Tatum points to a persistent issue when it comes to selling a business: the price. âI remain steadfast in my opinion that proper pricing is the first and, by far, the most essential element of the business selling process that the owner has to get right,â said Mr. Tatum. âIf the owner doesnât ask a reasonable price for his business, the likelihood of finding a buyer is extremely remote.” It is common knowledge in the business brokerage industry that anywhere from 80 to 90 percent of businesses put up for sale are never successfully sold. âThe leading reason the vast majority of small businesses on the market donât sell is because they are over-priced,â Mr. Tatum wrote in his book “Pricing a Small Business for Sale: A Practical Guide for Business Owners, Business Brokers, and Their Advisors.” He added, âAnd I mean way over-priced most of the time.â Unfortunately, business brokers sometimes perpetuate pricing misconceptions in an effort to get a listing. The longer my firm has been in business, the more disciplined my husband and I have become about turning away sellers with unreasonable pricing expectations. We met with one business owner this summer who wanted $7 million for his commercial H.V.A.C. company. It was successful, to be sure. But based on our experience, we felt a buyer would pay $4.5 to $5 million for the business. The seller told us he would be talking to our competitors. I had no doubt when he left that at least one of them would tell him what he wanted to hear. âDonât get caught up in a bidding war between competing business brokers and list your business with the broker who comes in with the highest most probable selling price,â Mr. Tatum advises business owners in his book. âNine times out of 10, the âwinningâ recommended selling price will be total” … uh, baloney. While I have seen my share of brokers behaving badly, I feel compelled to add that the past two years have been tough on our industry. Solid deals are hard to come by, and even harder to close. The credit markets — frozen since 2009 — have not thawed much, if at all. And while the recession may have ended officially in 2010, most of us are still waiting for a much-needed upswing. Baby, itâs cold outside. âHowever, hope springs eternal for business brokers,â said Mr. Tatum via e-mail. Indeed, despite a dismal year, I find myself hoping that business owners (and their brokers) will begin to align their pricing expectations with reality, plan now if theyâre even thinking about selling their business in the future, and start by getting a professional valuation of their company.
