AT&T has agreed to buy spectrum licenses from Qualcomm for $1.925 billion, the companies announced on Monday â in a deal that expands AT&T fourth generation, or 4G, capacity. The licenses encompass more than 300 million people across the country, with more than 70 million in the 15 largest metropolitan areas, including New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and San Francisco. AT&T is testing its 4G technology in Dallas and Boston, with plans to offer it commercially next year. The company reiterated its rollout plan in an investor briefing in October. âThe move will bolster AT&Tâs ability to provide an advanced broadband experience for its customers in the years ahead,â the company said in a statement.  Qualcomm, based in San Diego, uses the spectrum for FLO TV, the mobile television service that it plans to shut down by March 2011. Last summer, Qualcomm announced it was exploring âstrategic optionsâ for FLO TV.  The transaction, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the second half of 2011.  Advertisement
