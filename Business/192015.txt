JPMorgan Chase has fully syndicated its $20 billion loan to AT&T for the cellphone carrier’s bid to buy T-Mobile USA, spreading it out across 11 other banks, according to a regulatory filing. The move could allay fears that JPMorgan could face a big credit risk if it were forced to hold the loan — the biggest ever by a single bank — on its books.  That concern was articulated last week in a research note by Moody’s Investor Research . The Moody’s analyst calculated the loan as representing about 17 percent of JPMorgan’s tier-one capital, a big sum by any means. But people with knowledge of the loan discussions previously told DealBook that JPMorgan was confident it would be able to disperse the risk by distributing pieces of the loan to other banks. The firm began contacting potential syndication partners this week, these people said. DealBook previously reported that JPMorgan was able to make the loan very quickly in part because of its strong balance sheet and because AT&T is a longstanding client with good credit ratings. According to the loan agreement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, JPMorgan syndicated the loan to the following banks: AT&T will likely pay an interest rate of about 0.75 percent above the one-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor, if it draws down the loan. That could change slightly if the carrier’s credit rating falls. Advertisement
