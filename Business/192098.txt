With the rash of foreclosures across the country in recent years, many lawyers have specialized in the lucrative business of handling cases for banks and loan servicers. And now that flaws are being acknowledged by big lenders in the processing of foreclosures, some of these lawyers are finding themselves in the cross hairs of investigators â and scorned by their former clients. Consider the case of David J. Stern, a lawyer in Plantation, Fla., whose firm handled an estimated 20 percent of foreclosure-related proceedings in Florida, one of the states hit hardest by the housing crisis, Barry Meier reports in The New York Times. Mr. Stern is under investigation by the Florida attorney general and is a defendant in several lawsuits brought by homeowners. And in recent days, lenders and mortgage holding companies that had used Mr. Sternâs services, including Citigroup and GMAC Mortgage, said they would no longer do so. Mr. Stern has not been charged with any wrongdoing and a lawyer representing him, Jeffrey Tew, said that he had done nothing wrong. But a former employee recently testified that Mr. Sternâs firm, in a rush to file and complete thousands of foreclosures, routinely violated procedures by having foreclosure-related documents notarized that were never checked for accuracy â all with the lawyerâs knowledge.
