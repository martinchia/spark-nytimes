12:49 p.m. | Updated  Vulcan Materials officially rejected Martin Marietta Materials‘ unsolicited $4.9 billion takeover bid on Thursday, urging its shareholders to refuse the offer. Martin Marietta has gone directly to Vulcan’s shareholders, offering half of a share of its stock for each share of Vulcan. Both companies produce crushed gravel and rock.  In a statement, Vulcan’s board reiterated an argument the company had already made in court filings — that Martin Marietta’s tender offer undervalued the company and came at a low point for the cyclical construction business.  “Martin Marietta thinks that in this trough, it can transfer value from Vulcan shareholders to its own,” Donald M. James, Vulcan’s chief executive, told DealBook in an interview on Thursday. “In a good merger, two plus two equals five. Here, it probably only equals three.” Martin Marietta responded in a statement that it still wanted to strike a deal on friendly terms. The company added that it was willing to increase its offer â valued at $38.20 a share on Thursday â if it were presented with enough data. “Despite the rhetoric by Vulcan, the only real obstacle to delivering to Vulcan’s shareholders the substantial benefits of the proposed combination is the opposition of Vulcan’s board of directors,” Ward Nye, Martin Marietta’s chief executive, said in a statement. Shares of Vulcan rose nearly 0.9 percent on Thursday, closing at $39.22. Since Martin Marietta took its bid public last week, the two companies have fought largely in the legal arena. Martin Marietta has sued Vulcan in state courts in Delaware and New Jersey in an effort to soften Vulcan’s formidable takeover defenses. Vulcan itself sued Martin Marietta in federal court in its home state of Alabama on Monday, arguing that Martin Marietta illegally drew upon confidential information gleaned from nine years of intermittent merger talks between the two companies. In that lawsuit, Vulcan said Martin Marietta had promised in May 2010 not to use that information for an unsolicited takeover bid. “Not only does Martin Marietta’s misuse of information constitute a violation of explicit contractual obligations and the federal securities laws,” Vulcan said in its complaint, “but it also offends all notions of business ethics and fair dealing.” Vulcan listed additional reasons for shareholders to reject the Martin Marietta offer in a regulatory filing. Among them:  Mr. James said that when his company first began exploring a potential merger with Martin Marietta, his team quickly concluded that any deal would face significant antitrust scrutiny. It is a matter that “Martin Marietta has apparently chosen to gloss over in its public filings,” he said. Advertisement
