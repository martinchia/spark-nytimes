S.E.C. TAKES ON HIGH-SPEED TRADING  |  Regulators have been slow to react to changes in the stock market, which in the last decade has evolved into a place dominated by high-speed traders. Now, the Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking to update the marketâs rules for the new era, DealBookâs William Alden writes. On Thursday, Mary Jo White, the chairwoman of the S.E.C., unveiled a sweeping package of recommendations for new rules and other changes geared toward strengthening the structure of the market and improving disclosures for investors. The proposed changes extend to nearly every corner of the market, including exchanges, private trading venues known as dark pools, brokerage firms and high-frequency trading. The proposals, outlined in a speech, provide an answer to critics who have accused the S.E.C. of failing to do enough to curb market collapses and rein in high-speed traders. The speech also signaled that Ms. White planned to make market structure a top priority. But donât get too excited just yet: Any new rules are likely months, or even years, away from adoption. 

 POTENTIAL TELECOM DEALS DWINDLING  |  Telecommunications bankers are running out of deals to pitch, David Gelles writes in DealBook. Over the past three years, a wave of multibillion-dollar acquisitions has reshaped the wireless market. And now, with Sprint and T-Mobile close to agreeing on the terms of a $32 billion deal, one of the last big deals may be nearing an announcement.
Some deals that led to this moment, like Verizonâs purchase of Verizon Wireless from Vodafone, were foregone conclusions. Others, like AT&Tâs agreement to buy the satellite provider DirecTV, were surprise moves. Now, with only a few potential targets remaining, big wireless providers are likely to pursue content deals that layer media services on top of basic telephone services.
Sprintâs deal for T-Mobile hasnât yet been announced, let alone approved, but it already has at least one outspoken champion â Masayoshi Son, the Japanese billionaire who controls Sprint. DealBookâs Michael J. de la Merced writes: âUnlike other telecommunications leaders, Mr. Son has been happy to wield his bully pulpit, calling repeatedly for consolidation within the wireless industry.â The merger will likely face a stiff test from regulators in the coming months, but changes in the wireless market could sway opponents of the deal. 



BOND RALLY SQUEEZES BANKS  |  Wall Streetâs top investment banks typically hold billions of dollars of Treasury bonds on their balance sheets. This year, however, they grew bearish on the Treasury market, drastically cutting their holdings, Peter Eavis writes in DealBook. Now, that decision is coming back to haunt them.
Instead of falling, the prices of government bonds have risen solidly this year, resulting in big gains for those who continue to hold them. This has helped push down interest rates, providing an unexpected boon to companies and individuals taking out loans. But big bond-trading firms on Wall Street, including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, are not smiling as they brace for disappointing second-quarter results.
United States Treasuries have benefited partly because government bonds in Europe have had much lower yields, a situation that is likely to continue even as the European Central Bank announces new measures aimed at combating the devastating combination of slow growth and superlow inflation. But for Wall Street banks, problems with bond trading run deeper. Partly at fault are new regulations that have been put in place since the financial crisis.



ITâS JOBS DAY  |  Economists expect to see a reasonably healthy gain in hiring when the Labor Department releases its May figures at 8:30 a.m. The consensus is for employers to have added 218,000 in May, with the unemployment rate rising to 6.4 percent. 



ON THE AGENDA  |  In addition to the jobs report, data on consumer credit for April is out at 3 p.m. Happy birthday to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is turning 80.
TV watch: Neel Kashkari, who oversaw the Treasury Departmentâs Troubled Asset Relief Program and is running for governor of California, is on CNBC at 10 a.m. Paul A. McCulley, Pimcoâs chief economist, is on CNBC at 3:30 p.m. The quest for horse racingâs Triple Crown continues on Saturday with the 146th running of the Belmont Stakes.



MOW-TOWN  |  âTo most of the world, the solution to debt-ridden Detroit is money. But for one hedge fund manager, itâs goats,â DealBookâs Alexandra Stevenson writes. Mark Spitznagel, the founder of the $6 billion hedge fund Universa Investments, on Thursday brought 20 billy goats to Brightmoor, one of Detroitâs most blighted neighborhoods. 
Mr. Spitznagel, who is known for his unconventional investments in the stock market, called his plan an “urban farming experiment” and said he intended to let the goats, which have come from his own farmstead, roam and munch on overgrown grass. When he is not managing investments for his 15 or so clients, he tends to a business rearing goats and making cheese.
