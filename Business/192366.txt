Are you getting the most out of your business? One of my favorite things about writing for this blog is that I get to have interesting conversations with people about things Iâve never considered. Take buying a business on eBay. Never in a thousand years would I have guessed that this was possible. Not only is it possible, it turns out that the business-for-sale marketplace on eBay is highly active. In a recent search, I found hundreds of businesses that might be legitimate purchase targets, including 870 businesses — advertising businesses, cafes, bakeries — that were priced from $10,000 to $100,000. I also stumbled upon Rob Bellenfant, who started his first business when he was 12 years old. During the time he and a partner ran that business, they pivoted four times: What started as a web-design company became a web-hosting business, then morphed into a server-management company and ended up as an information technology staffing company. Then Mr. Bellenfant, all of 18 and about to enterÂ his first year at the University of Tennessee, sold the business to his partner. Mr.Â Bellenfant has bought five businesses on eBay, four of them busts.  The first businesses Mr. Bellenfantâs bought on eBay were an eBook about a natural cure for asthma and several companies that designed websites for small businesses. He currently owns, TechnologyAdvice, which helps businesses assess their technology purchases. Each of these businesses had revenue and even, reportedly, profits. Mr. Belefantâs big mistake in all four of his eBay busts was that he didnât perform due diligence. In fact, when he first started buying his businesses, he had never heard of due diligence. Over time he learned that before he wrote a check, he needed to make sure the businesses were telling some approximation of the truth. Fortunately, Mr.Â Bellenfant wasnât paying a tremendous amount money for these businesses. Each one cost less than $20,000. Then, in 2008 he bought Ad-Site, which after a series of pivots became Thrive Marketing and then TechnologyAdvice. This business really did have revenue and profits and cash flow. The business would buy advertising time in bulk and then break it up and sell it in smaller pieces. There was only one problem: His main supplier went out of business six weeks afterÂ Mr.Â Bellenfant bought the business. Had he used a business broker to help him buy his businesses,Â Mr.Â Bellenfant might have gotten guidance that would have helped him avoid some of the mistakes he made. When individuals buy businesses with no professional help — regardless of whether they are bought on eBay or anywhere else — itâs easy to make mistakes that can lead to a significant loss of money. Too often things donât work out as planned. Even buyers who perform in-depth due diligence can find nasty surprises awaiting them when they finally take control of the company. While I was in my food service business, our first acquisition was so poorly done that it almost sunk my company. The same was true for Mr. Bellenfant. Losing your one and only supplier would put many businesses out of business. Mr.Â Bellenfant, however, managed to find a new supplier and has built his purchase into a growing company that now employs 50 people. If you some reason you do buy a business without professional help, be sure to review a checklist of issues to consider. Had Mr. Bellenfant learned more about the supplier that his business was going to depend upon, he might have realized that he needed to find a different supplier — or walk away from the deal. A thorough investigation of the business also would have shown that most of his customers were too small to afford the services that would make his business successful. Over time, Mr.Â Bellenfant had to make several pivots into completely different businesses — so many that he might have been better off had he started the business from scratch. In his case, he spent eight years moving from one business model to another before finding one that has turned out to be successful.
