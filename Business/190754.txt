DAVOS, Switzerland â The intersection of technology and privacy issues presents a unique challenge for businesses as governments increasingly seek to collect vast amounts of data on the public, a group of business and political leaders said on Wednesday. Speaking on a panel at the annual World Economic Forum here, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said privacy was a basic human right and should not be sacrificed in the name of security.   âWe are collecting far too much information,â Mr. Leahy said. âIt is not making us safer.â Bradford L. Smith, general counsel of Microsoft, said governments should obtain information about their citizens through a judicial process that falls under international law. He said Microsoft would continue to challenge governments in court if they have not followed the appropriate path to seek out such data.  âIt is not our right â no one elected us â to simply decide we should turn over someoneâs information,â Mr. Smith said. Mr. Smith said the technology industry had hardened its equipment and embraced stronger encryption methods amid reports that the United States government tried to tap transmission lines between data centers for some of the nationâs largest Internet companies. Augie K. Fabela, co-founder of the telecommunications company VimpelCom, said the wide collection of data could be used positively in areas like education and health care, but that governments had been too broad in what they sought. Mr. Fabela said his company had been successful in narrowing the scope of government requests. âYou need to target the real criminals,â he said. âYou donât need to target the entire population.â Advertisement
