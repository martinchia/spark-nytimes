Carrie Bradshaw may have spent approximately 97.3 percent of her income on Manolos, but the typical single woman budgets a little differently. Ahead of International Women’s Day — which is tomorrow — here’s the first of a few posts on women in the economy. The chart below, which comes from the latest “Women at Work” report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, shows how single women in America spend their money, depending on how much they earn. As you can see, the typical single woman spends less than 5 percent of her income on “apparel and services,” with a plurality of her income spent on shelter: The report also notes that “Women in the highest income group â those earning an annual pretax income greater than or equal to $40,000 â spent, on average, a higher amount per person on transportation, entertainment, and apparel and services than women in the lowest three income groups combined.” Floyd Norris, the chief financial correspondent of The New York Times, covers the world of finance and  economics.
