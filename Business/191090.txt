FRANKFURT â Deutsche Bank is determined to remain among the top five investment banks in the world, its co-chief executives told shareholders on Thursday at a typically raucous annual meeting, even as other European lenders cut back their profitable but risky trading activities. But comments by shareholders and other critics revealed a high degree of unease about that strategy, which comes after a decline of 24 percent in the bankâs share price since January and amid plans to tap shareholders and other investors for 8 billion euros, or about $11 billion, in new capital. âOnly thanks to the blood donations of capital providers is Deutsche Bank able to pay bonuses and dividends,â Sven Giegold, a German member of the European Parliament, said in a statement. As usual, the annual meeting at a concert hall here was an opportunity for an eclectic group of critics to air their grievances, some political and some financial. Sympathizers see the bank, Germanyâs largest, as a convenient  punching bag for left-wing activists; critics see it as the embodiment of the excesses that plunged the world into a financial crisis. Anyone with at least one share was entitled to speak. Some complained about the dividend, unchanged since last year at 75 euro cents or the share price decline. Other complained about the bankâs role in financing projects that, they said, threaten tigers in India or the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. Deutsche Bank executives focused on their ambitions to remain a European champion in investment banking, otherwise dominated by American institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs. “We see good opportunities to win market share in highly profitable business areas, especially now when some of our competitors are pulling back from investment banking,” said JÃ¼rgen Fitschen, who shares chief executive duties with Anshu Jain. Under pressure from regulators, banks like UBS of Switzerland and Barclays of Britain have been scaling back their investment banking units, leaving Deutsche Bank as the largest European competitor to Wall Street giants like JPMorgan Chase or Goldman Sachs, a status the German bank vowed to defend. “There will be winners and losers in the banking world,” said Mr. Jain, a native of India who delivered a prepared text in competent German. “We want to position Deutsche Bank systematically as a winner.” But shareholders expressed doubts about whether the bank can succeed. Klaus Nieding, a representative of the Deutsche Schutzvereinigung fÃ¼r Wertpapierbesitz, a shareholder group, complained that Deutsche Bank shares had performed more poorly than rivals like JPMorgan. “The truth is that you have lost tremendous ground in investment banking,” he said during shareholder comments. Mr. Fitschen responded that declines in fees the bank earned from executing transactions for customers were a result of a lower volume of trading in global markets. “The cake was smaller for everybody,” he said. Mr. Nieding also complained about the costs of misconduct by the bank, which is among those accused of helping to rig benchmark interest rates and is under investigation for potential manipulation of global currency markets. “Deutsche Bank has become a big legal department with a banking subsidiary,” Mr. Nieding said. Stefan Krause, the Deutsche Bank chief financial officer, told the crowd that the bank had spent about â¬350 million in 2013 on legal advice involving more than 6,000 lawsuits and official probes. About 1,000 of the suits involve sums of more than €100,000, according to the bank.  Responding to a shareholder who asked if there were any banking scandals that Deutsche Bank is not involved in, Mr. Krause said the bank has introduced a so-called reputational risk management system, which examines whether transactions have a potential to damage the bank’s image as well as its finances. For nearly two years, Mr. Jain has been promising that the bank would remake itself to be more focused on the interests of society and its clients.Â Industry critics are wary of such commitments by big banks to change their behavior. Mr. Jain said earlier this week that the bank saw huge growth potential in helping European businesses tap capital markets for credit, a market currently much smaller than the one in the United States. He also said the bank, which has concentrated on investments that provide a fixed return, would be in a good position to meet demand from an aging population seeking a steady retirement income. The shareholder meeting followed a familiar ritual reflecting the bank’s status as an icon of German capitalism. As always, protesters outside banged drums and waved banners and performed for television cameras. One group was dressed in orange and white fish costumes and was among those protesting the bank’s role in financing a development project in Abbot Point, a port in Queensland, Australia. The protesters said the project threatens marine life in the Great Barrier Reef.  Inside the hall, where Miley Cyrus is scheduled to perform next month, a small group of people from the Occupy movement interrupted the introductory speech by Paul Achleitner, chairman of the Deutsche Bank supervisory board. The hecklers waved a banner and chanted before being escorted out roughly by security guards. Shareholders, many of them elderly, seemed to pay little heed, instead lining up at buffet tables for what is known in Germany as the “wurst dividend.” In coming weeks, shareholders will face a decision whether to buy new shares that the bank is offering to existing shareholders in order to raise the â¬8 billion in new capital, part of a drive to meet coming regulatory requirements and demands that banks become less of a liability to shareholders. Mr. Nieding, the shareholder representative, said it was a good sign that the royal family of Qatar had decided to buy â¬1.75 billion of the new shares “after looking deep into the books.” But Mr. Nieding also could not resist taking a jab at Deutsche Bank’s management. “Mr. Achleitner said last year he would be ashamed to take money from the government,” Mr. Nieding said. “Apparently he meant the German government, not the Qatari government.” Mr. Achleitner defended a motion to allow the bank’s supervisory board to award bonus pay equal to 200 percent of fixed compensation, rather than 100 percent, for Mr. Jain, Mr. Fitschen and the other five members of the executive board. Mr. Achleitner said the change was not a pay raise, but rather gave the supervisory board flexibility to reward the executives for long-term performance. Hans-Martin Buhlmann, a representative of another shareholder group, the Vereinigung Institutionelle Privatanleger, expressed opposition to the motion. “Is it necessary to pay so much to retain people who have hurt us?” Mr. Buhlmann said. Trading has often generated most of Deutsche Bankâs profit, but traders have also been the source of many legal problems: • FEB. 2014  The bank fired three currency traders in New York as regulators worldwide pursued investigations into potential manipulation of the $5-trillion-a-day foreign exchange market. • FEB. 2014  The bank agreed to pay about â¬925 million, or $1.27 billion, to settle a 12-year dispute with the heirs of Leo Kirch over the collapse of his media group. The Kirch Group claimed that doubts expressed by Deutsche Bankâs  chief executive about the companyâs creditworthiness led to its demise. • DEC. 2013  The bank agreed to pay $1.9 billion to settle claims that it had defrauded Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the sale of U.S. mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. • DEC. 2013  E.U. antitrust regulators fined six financial institutions â¬1.7 billion, or $2.3 billion, for manipulating the London interbank offered rate, Libor, and its euro equivalent, Euribor. Deutsche Bank was fined the most, â¬725 million. Advertisement
