Dr. Dre, left, and Tyrese Gibson celebrated Appleâs discussions to buy Beats Electronics, the company behind the popular Beats by Dr. Dre headphones, for $3.2 billion. Since Apple introduced iTunes and the iPod more than 10 years ago, it has been the king of music. So naturally, Apple’s potential $3.2 billion deal for Beats Electronics, the company behind the lava-hot Dr. Dre headphones, ignited a flurry of activity on social media. The conversation on Twitter began with the news, then a flood of questions. After all, the deal would be the biggest acquisition in Apple’s history — was this what the company should be doing with its mountains of cash? As analysts attempt to make sense of it all, here’s the morning-after summary, courtesy of Twitter. First, the initial reaction to the news.

Story coming. â Peter Kafka (@pkafka) 8 May 14 @pkafka I bet it has something to do with money. Probably they think Beats will help them make more of it. Just a guess. â Farhad Manjoo (@fmanjoo) 8 May 14 Just grabbed my pair of Virgin America headphones. Wonder how much $AAPL will pay for them. â danprimack (@danprimack) 8 May 14 Apple, why do you refuse to buy Nintendo? Can you not see how entertaining that would be to write about? â Harry McCracken (@harrymccracken) 9 May 14 Biggest mystery tonight: Why Apple buys Beats, or why whoever drafts Manziel? â Tony Fratto (@TonyFratto) 9 May 14 New logo ? #apple #beats //t.co/Xb9R2KAjT1 â Ouriel Ohayon (@OurielOhayon) 8 May 14 I mostly listen to public radio. Which Beats headphones should I get? â Farhad Manjoo (@fmanjoo) 8 May 14 There were also words of advice. If this is true, Tim Cook should get advice from Mark Zuckerberg about how to keep big acquisitions quiet. â Farhad Manjoo (@fmanjoo) 8 May 14 26 potential new business ideas for Dr. Dre now that Beats is about to become Apple property. #BeansByDre //t.co/1jWc88FFR4 â Esquire Magazine (@Esquiremag) 9 May 14 Not everyone was confident in their opinion on the deal. I donât have a strong opinion on the Beats acquisition AMA â Kevin Roose (@kevinroose) 8 May 14 But those who did, voiced them loudly.

(It now appears to be back up on YouTube.) Dr Dre Facebook video that seemed to confirm Apple deal taken down. //t.co/rSha5zmNQW No doubt to clean up language for a PG-13 rating â Jeffrey Cane (@Jeffrey_Cane) 9 May 14 One of Beats’ lawyers must’ve freaked the heck out over Tyrese Gibson’s FB videos. â Joseph Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) 9 May 14 Now, as everyone fights off their Twitter hangover on the morning after the deal, the mood seems to have shifted to one of reflection. Question is not why are they being aggressive in buying Beats; question is why are they so conservative on not buying everything else? â Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) 9 May 14 Iâm deeply immersed in the Appleverse, and subscribe to both Pandora and Spotify. Will a Beats acquisition spur me to unsubscribe? â Felix Salmon (@felixsalmon) 9 May 14 I actually think the Omnicom-Publicis deal breakup is much more newsworthy than the Beats deal. But Apple. â Ivan the Kâ¢ (@IvanTheK) 9 May 14 HeyyyeyyyeEYEYyyyEYYYY buy smaller technology companies from time to time every day â Matthew Zeitlin (@MattZeitlin) 9 May 14 oh wait, apple buying beats wasn’t a big joke? â dan (@dcseifert) 9 May 14 Advertisement
