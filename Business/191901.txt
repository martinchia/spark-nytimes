Today's QuestionWhat small-business owners think. What small-business owners think. âHelp! My business is listed âPERMANENTLY CLOSEDâ on Google Maps even though it has always been open! Help!â This type of message, according to a New York Times article by David Segal — “Closed, Says Google, But Shops’ Signs Say Open” — is becoming increasingly common. As Mr. Segal reported: On Google Places, a typical listing has the address of a business, a description provided by the owner and links to photos, reviews and Google Maps. It also has a section titled âReport a problemâ and one of the problems to report is âthis place is permanently closed.â If enough users click it, the business is labeled âreportedly closedâ and later, pending a review by Google, âpermanently closed.â Google was tight-lipped about its review methods and would not discuss them.
