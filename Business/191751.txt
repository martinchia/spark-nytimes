 Billboard, the music industry’s premier trade publication for more than a century, named Tony Gervino as its editor on Monday, the latest in a series of changes to remake the magazine in a more general-interest direction. Mr. Gervino, 47, is a former executive editor of Hearst Magazines International, and has been an editor at various lifestyle and sports magazines like Antenna and Slam. He has also been a frequent contributor on sports and popular culture for The New York Times and other publications. Mr. Gervino’s résumé is unusual for Billboard, whose leaders have tended to come squarely from the world of music journalism. But the magazine, long one of the major sources of news and minutiae about the music industry, has been shifting since January, when it was taken over by Janice Min of The Hollywood Reporter. Since then, it has featured more celebrity and fashion coverage, among other changes. Ms. Min, who is co-president and chief creative officer of the Guggenheim Media Entertainment Group, the parent company of both publications, endorsed Mr. Gervino as a music aficionado with the necessary journalism skills for Billboard’s new direction. “What I like about Tony is the ability to take this niche knowledge of music and package it to make it much more friendly and much more outward-facing,” Ms. Min said in an interview on Monday. Mr. Gervino’s appointment is to take effect on April 28. Billboard’s current editor, Joe Levy — a music editor of long experience at publications like Rolling Stone and The Village Voice — is to become the magazine’s editor-at-large, and return to writing, according to an announcement. A version of this article appears in print on April 8, 2014, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Billboard Names an Editor With a Focus Beyond Music.
