The Securities and Exchange Commission is putting Philip A. Falcone on alert. Mr. Falcone, a hedge fund manager, received a Wells Notice from the commission on Thursday, according to a filing made by his firm, Harbinger Capital Partners. The agency typically sends those notices when it is considering an enforcement action against someone. Omar Asali and Robin Roger, two Harbinger board members, also received the notices. The notices stem from possible “violations of the federal securities lawsâ anti-fraud provisions in connection with matters previously disclosed and an additional matter regarding the circumstances and disclosure related to agreements with certain fund investors,” according to the filing. Although the filing does not specify charges or allegations, the notice is likely related to a disclosure Harbinger made to investors. In April, the firm said it was being investigated  for possible market manipulation in the trading of undisclosed debt securities from 2006 to 2008. Mr. Falcone has also been investigated over whether a $113 million personal loan he made to himself, using his firm’s funds, was disclosed to investors in a timely manner. The notices come near the end of a rough year for Mr. Falcone. LightSquared, a telecommunications company in which he has made huge investments, has come under fire from regulators and lawmakers; its principal venture, a broadband wireless project, was approved by the Federal Communications Commission despite lingering questions about whether it would interfere with GPS networks. In September, seven Republican lawmakers sent Mr. Falcone a letter questioning whether the billionaire tried to curry favor with regulators overseeing LightSquared by making campaign donations. Although the Wells Notices do not contain formal charges or allegations of wrongdoing, they generally spook investors. Mr. Falcone has reportedly dealt with a spate of redemptions from investors looking to exit his funds this year. In June, Bloomberg pegged those redemptions at more than $1 billion. In the filing, Harbinger said that it was “disappointed” about the notices, and that it would “vigorously defend against” any charges of wrongdoing. Advertisement
