9:46 a.m. | Updated  LONDON — Morgan Stanley is selling its British wealth management business, Quilter, to the private equity firm Bridgepoint, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Morgan Stanley is looking to sell Quilter to focus its wealth management business on high-net-worth customers, those who typically have more than $1 million to invest. Quilter, which caters to clients in the so-called mass-affluent market who are willing to invest up to $250,000, does not fit with this strategy, said a person briefed on the matter. The deal is likely to be completed this week, and it would be the second time Morgan Stanley has sold Quilter, based in London, which had Â£7.6 billion ($11.8 billion) in assets under management as of Dec. 31.  The bank previously sold the wealth management unit to Citigroup in 2006, but reacquired the business in 2009 when the two banks combined their wealth management operations in the joint venture Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. The deal, which is expected to close by the end of March, is valued at about Â£175 million, according to another person familiar with the matter. Bridgepoint outbid the European private equity firm Permira, the person added. Morgan Stanley, Bridgepoint and Permira declined to comment. Advertisement
