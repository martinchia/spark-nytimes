American unemployment has been declining for the last four years. In 2010, the jobless rate in the United States and the euro area were both around 10 percent. Last month, American unemployment stood at 6.6 percent. In the euro area it is hovering around 12 percent. But is the United States really doing that much better? A recent study by Thomas Klitgaard and Richard Peck at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York suggests that the outperformance of the American job market is, to a significant extent, a statistical mirage: American unemployment numbers reflect a shrinking labor force.   The differing work force trends in Europe and the United States have little to do with the responses to the economic emergency on either side of the ocean. Instead, they mostly have to do with the working habits of older women.  In January, 63 percent of working-age Americans were either working or looking for work. Thatâs 1.8 percentage points fewer than in January 2010.  In the euro area, by contrast, the labor force participation rate has remained roughly flat over the last four years.  According to the economists at the New York Fed, if the labor force in the countries using the euro had shrunk as much as it did in the United States, euro area unemployment would be around 9.5 percent. Though this is still higher than it is in the United States, it is below where it was at the start of Europeâs sovereign debt crisis. Whatâs going on? Europe and the United States face some of the same demographic and economic forces. Populations are aging on both sides of the Atlantic. Many workers in Europe, too, have stopped looking for work, discouraged by lack of opportunities.  There is, however, one big difference. In the euro area, the working rate of older women is still much lower than it is in the United States. Almost half of American women over 45 are in the labor market, compared to fewer than 40 percent in the euro zone. And European women are picking up the slack. So despite a severe economic downturn, the share of older women in the labor pool has been growing at a robust clip. This means that the recovery of the euro areaâs job market may look worse than it actually is. Mr. Klitgaard and Mr. Peck wrote: âJust as a declining labor force has put downward pressure on the U.S. unemployment rate, increasing labor force participation will put upward pressure on the euro area rate, making the labor market look less healthy than other indicators might suggest.â A version of this article appears in print on 02/08/2014, on page B1 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Why the Job Picture in Europe Looks Different.
