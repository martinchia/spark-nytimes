 Greenlight Capital, the hedge fund run by aspiring the New York Mets-owner David Einhorn, has sold its entire stake in Yahoo, prompted by a spat between the company and a Chinese business partner that “wasn’t what we signed up for,” according to the fund’s quarterly letter to investors. In the letter, reported earlier by zerohedge, the firm said it suffered a modest loss from the trade, which was just a few months old. Greenlight bought about 8.5 million shares in the first quarter of the year at an average price of nearly $17.  Yahoo’s share price was trading at $15.48 early Friday.  The dispute between the company and online marketplace Alibaba has continued to fester. The tension relates to a decision by the chief executive of Alibaba to transfer one of the company’s most profitable businesses into a separate company that he controls. Yahoo, which owns about 40 percent of the Chinese firm, has said it was caught unaware by the transfer.  So far this year, Greenlight, which manages $7.8 billion, is down 5 percent. The hedge fund is one of a number of prominent managers suffering losses through the second quarter. Since helping to found the hedge fund in 1996, Mr. Einhorn has returned an average of 19 percent a year. Advertisement
