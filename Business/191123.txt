Goldman Sachs said on Monday that it had hired Robert B. Zoellick, the former president of the World Bank, as the chairman of its international advisory board. The hiring is something of a homecoming for Mr. Zoellick, who worked as the firm’s vice chairman, international and a managing director from 2006 to 2007. Mr. Zoellick, a lawyer by training, has spent most of his life in government service within Republican administrations. Most recently, he served as the president of the World Bank from 2007 until his term expired in June of 2012. And from 2001 to 2005, he served as George W. Bush‘s trade representative.  In the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, Mr. Zoellick worked in the Treasury and State Departments, as well as White House deputy chief of staff. He did spend time in the private sector, including working from 1993 to 1997 as an executive vice president of Fannie Mae, where he focused on affordable housing and government and legal relations. Over the past year, he has been a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and at Harvard. Mr. Zoellick sits on the board of Temasek, the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund, and the international advisory board of the Rolls-Royce Group. Advertisement
