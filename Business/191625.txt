8:04 p.m. | Updated  Groupon, the daily deals site, seemed a bit less like a deal on Wednesday. In its first earnings release as a public company, Groupon reported a fourth-quarter loss of $9.8 million on an adjusted basis, disappointing investors, who drove its shares down sharply in after-hours trading. Still, by other measures, the Internet company showed continued strong growth. Revenue for the quarter jumped 194 percent, to $506.5 million, from the quarter a year ago, surpassing analystsâ forecasts. From the time Groupon first sought to go public, its story has been built on enormous growth, as it raced to acquire a daunting customer base. The company now claims to have 33 million active users worldwide â those who have bought at least one deal over the last year â up more than 20 percent from a year ago. âThis quarterâs results show that our model is just starting to demonstrate leverage â and that Groupon is the clear leader in our space,â said Jason Child, Grouponâs chief financial officer. Yet the company was also cautious in guiding investors on revenue for the first quarter, forecasting revenue of just $510 million to $550 million. And while the company has continued to trim its marketing expenses over the last year, to $256,000, its nonmarketing costs climbed to $247.4 million. In a conference call after the earnings report, Andrew Mason, Grouponâs chief executive and co-founder, pointed to âstrong repeat purchase behavior within our customer base.â âWhile we are still investing aggressively in growth, our paid marketing continues to become more efficient,â he said. In after-hours trading, shares of Groupon fell 13 percent. Since it went public in November at $20 a share, the stock has gained 23 percent. The fourth-quarter loss, which amounts to 2 cents a share, is down sharply from the $185 million loss for the quarter a year ago. The company cited an unusually high tax rate for some of its overseas operations. The pro-forma figures exclude certain accounting charges, like stock-based compensation. On a basis of generally accepted accounting principles, Groupon lost $42.7 million for the quarter. The company also said that it had turned an operating profit of $15 million, its first in nearly two years. Advertisement
