Agilent Technologies, a maker of scientific instruments, agreed on Thursday to buy Dako, a Danish cancer diagnostics company, for $2.2 billion. The acquisition is the largest ever by Agilent, which was spun out of Hewlett-Packard more than a decade ago and posted revenue of $6.6 billion last year. Under the terms of the deal, Agilent, based in Santa Clara, Calif., will pay cash for Dako, currently owned by the Swedish private equity firm EQT. The transaction is the latest in a flurry of deals in the health care sector, which continues to show signs off growth despite concerns about the broader economy. Last month, NestlÃ© agreed to buy Pfizerâs infant nutrition business for $11.9 billion, while the drug maker AstraZeneca also announced a $1.26 billion takeover of Ardea Biosciences. Agilent said it was buying Dako to expand its presence in the life sciences industry. âIn the rapidly growing diagnostics market, Dakoâs products and capabilities are a strategic complement to Agilentâs existing offerings,â Agilentâs chief executive, William P. Sullivan, said in a statement. âAgilentâs strategy in acquiring Dako is about strengthening the companyâs presence in life science and about revenue growth.â Dako, which was bought by EQT in 2007, provides antibodies, scientific instruments and software pathology laboratories as part of the diagnosis of cancer. It has annual revenue of more than $300 million and employs about 1,000 people, primarily in Denmark and California. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of July. Credit Suisse and the law firm Cleary Gottlieb advised Agilent on the deal, while Goldman Sachs and the law firm Davis Polk advised EQT. Advertisement
