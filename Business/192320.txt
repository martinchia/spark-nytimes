Family Dollar Stores again rejected on Wednesday a $9.1 billion takeover approach from Dollar General and urged shareholders not to tender their shares to the discount retailer’s bigger rival. The step, largely formal, prolongs a heated battle over the fate of one of the country’s most prominent dollar stores. Dollar General is looking to derail an agreement that Family Dollar struck to sell itself to a small competitor, Dollar Tree, for $8.5 billion. In a news release, Family Dollar noted that Dollar General’s offer to buy shares directly from shareholders is a largely symbolic gesture, because it won’t actually purchase the shares unless the two companies reach an agreement.  But Family Dollar reiterated that the offer remains problematic. Combining the two companies, it has consistently argued, would run afoul of antitrust regulators who would be displeased that two of the country’s biggest dollar stores would be combining.  Though Dollar General has raised its offer price and added both a $500 million break-up fee in case a merger is blocked on antitrust grounds and a pledge to divest up to 1,500 stores if necessary, its target insists that such measures are not enough. “Our board of directors, with the assistance of outside advisers and consultants, reviewed all aspects of Dollar Generalâs tender offer and concluded unanimously that this highly conditional offer is illusory because, as Dollar General is well aware, the offer cannot close on the terms proposed,” Howard R. Levine, Family Dollar’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Tenders into the Dollar General offer will be meaningless since there is no way that Dollar General can purchase shares that are tendered.” The rejection has the backing of a major Family Dollar shareholder, the activist hedge fund Trian Partners. Such support could prove important, because such an investor would normally be expected to back a higher-priced takeover offer. “We are focused on delivering to Family Dollar shareholders the highest value with certainty, and the Dollar Tree transaction does just that,” Edward P. Garden, Trian’s chief investment officer and a Family Dollar board member, said in a statement. “As we have highlighted previously, Dollar General has repeatedly stated that antitrust is not a risk, yet they have put forth proposals that require Family Dollar shareholders to bear the ultimate risk.” Morgan Stanley and the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton are advising Family Dollar, while Goldman Sachs and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett is advising Dollar General.
