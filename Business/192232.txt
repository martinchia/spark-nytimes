HSBC said Monday that profit more than doubled last year, but that it expected new capital rules to weigh on the bankâs return on equity. Profit rose to $13.2 billion last year from $5.8 billion in the year before, as two units returned to profit and loan losses almost halved. But the earnings missed some analyst expectations, and HSBC said that new regulation that required banks to hold more capital would lead to a return on shareholdersâ equity of 12 percent to 15 percent in the long term — less than previously estimated. Shares of HSBC dropped 3 percent in early trading in London. HSBC’s chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said the bank âhad a good start to the yearâ but that ârisks to global growth remain, not least from an elevated oil price.â âWe therefore expect cyclical volatility to continue â- including in emerging markets â- and progress is unlikely to be linear,â Mr. Gulliver said. HSBC, which generates more than half of its profit from Hong Kong and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, said it expected growth in emerging markets to continue to outpace that of Western markets. Profit rose after its operation in North America and its personal financial services business reported gains, the company said. HSBC set aside $13.5 billion for loan losses in 2010, down 46 percent from $24.9 billion a year earlier, as the economy improved. Earnings at its investment banking unit, which made up most of the bankâs profit before tax in 2009, fell to $9.5 billion last year from $10.5 billion the year previous. HSBC posted a profit of $454 million in North America following a loss of $7.7 billion in 2009. Advertisement
