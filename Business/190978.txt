Intel agreed Monday to buy a 15 percent stake in ASML Holding, a Dutch semiconductor equipment maker, in an investment that may total as much as $4.1 billion. Under the terms of the deal, Intel will buy an initial 10 percent of ASMLâ€™s shares for about $2.1 billion. The American technology giant also agreed to pay about $1 billion to help finance additional research and development costs at ASML.  The investment will be used primarily to speed up the introduction of bigger chip wafers and newer semiconductor manufacturing technology known as extreme ultraviolet lithography. If approved by ASML shareholders, Intel would later buy an additional 5 percent for $1 billion. ASML, which is based in Veldhoven in the Netherlands, had previously said that it planned to sell up to 25 percent of itself to chip makers like Intel as a way to raise capital.  Intel said that it plans to pay for the investment through cash held in foreign subsidiaries, which it can use without incurring taxes in the United States. Advertisement
