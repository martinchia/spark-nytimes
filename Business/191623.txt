LONDON — The British software company Misys said on Friday that it was in talks with Temenos, a software maker in Switzerland, for a potential all-share merger that would create a company with a market value of roughly $3 billion. The announcement follows a failed effort by Fidelity National Information Services, a software company, to takeover Misys for $2.2 billion in August. The combination of Misys and Temenos would create of one the worldâs largest banking software companies, providing financial institutions with support in their risk-management and other back-office operations. âDiscussions are continuing and there can be no certainty that a transaction will ultimately take place, nor as to the terms on which any transaction might be constituted,â Misys said in a statement. Temenos, based in Geneva, said that it noted Misysâs announcement and was âconstantly evaluating its strategic options.â   Both companies said discussions were at an early stage and no decisions had been made. Temenos declined to comment on the talks. A representative for Misys was not immediately available for comment.
