Rockefeller Group, the United States real estate investor, has agreed to buy a controlling stake in the private property fund manager Europa, in its first British deal. Detailed terms of the deal, which reflects Rockefeller’s ambition to build a global property investment management platform, have been kept confidential, Reuters said. But The Financial Times, which first reported the deal, said Europa would still operate its opportunistic private equity real estate strategy and retain a significant minority stake. According to the newspaper, Rockefeller, which was advised by Credit Suisse, has been searching for a potential fund management acquisition to use as a springboard into the European market. Europa, which is based in London, was not thought to have solicited offers, it added. Europa has more than $2.8 billion in assets under management, having  raised six opportunistic real estate funds and invested more than 6 billion  euros since 1995, The Financial Times said. Rockefeller, which is owned by Mitsubishi Estate of Japan, is expected to improve Europa’s financial strength and access to an international investor base.
