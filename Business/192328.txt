LONDON â The London Stock Exchange said on Friday that its fiscal first-quarter operating profit rose 36 percent as the number of initial public offerings on its stock markets in Britain and Italy more than doubled. The exchange also confirmed on Friday that it planned to raise 938 million pounds, or about $1.6 billion, to help fund its acquisition of Russell Investments, the owner of the Russell 2000 stock market index. The L.S.E. agreed in June to pay $2.7 billion in cash for Russell. For the three months that ended June 30, the L.S.E.’s operating profit increased to Â£102 million pounds. That compares with Â£74.8 million in the period a year earlier. Revenue in its primary markets business, namely from I.P.O.s, increased 30 percent to Â£25.3 million. The L.S.E.-owned markets in Britain and Italy had 78 new offerings in the first quarter, compared with 33 a year earlier. The offerings on L.S.E. markets raised Â£19.9 billion in the fiscal first quarter. I.P.O. activity remained strong in July with 28 new issues, the exchange said, compared with 25 offerings in July 2013. The stock market operator has had seven I.P.O.s so far in August alone. “We continue to make good progress, delivering a strong financial performance this quarter with an increase in operating profit, reflecting organic growth and inorganic revenues across the group,â Xavier Rolet, the L.S.E.’s chief executive, said in a statement. âWe have seen a resurgence in the I.P.O. market with an increase in both the number of companies joining our markets and the amount of money raised.â Revenue, including gains from its clearing business, rose 16 percent to Â£324.6 million. Separately, the L.S.E. said on Friday that it planned to issue 74.3 million new shares at a price of Â£12.95 in September as part of its move to acquire Russell Investments, which is based in Seattle. The deal for Russell is the latest step in the L.S.E.âs attempts to diversify and expand its intellectual property platform. The acquisition will also give the exchange a presence in the United States, the worldâs largest financial services market. A meeting of L.S.E. shareholders to consider the Russell Investments transaction is set for Sept. 10. The L.S.E. said that if the Russell transaction were to fall through, it would return the proceeds of its rights issue to shareholders. Russell Investments operates an asset management business and a stock market indexing business. The company has about $256 billion in assets under management. Following the transaction, the L.S.E. has said that it will evaluate how Russell’s asset management business would fit in the wider group. The exchange already owns the FTSE Group, the operator of indexes including the FTSE 100, which tracks the top 100 stocks traded in London. It also operates the Borsa Italiana. Advertisement
