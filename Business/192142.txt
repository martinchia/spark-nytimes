In a case study weâve just published, Adriana Gardella writes about Fikes Products, a 30-employee company that sells janitorial supplies and services to restaurants, retailers, and other businesses. Mark Sims, the owner, wanted to hire a strong No. 2 person and also fill four additional slots. But he didn’t trust his own hiring abilities and he was reluctant to spend the money for a recruiter. Ultimately, he did decide to use a recruiter. Below, you can read what several business owners with relevant experience think of Mr. Sims’s decisions, and you can leave your own comments below. Weâll follow up next week with a blog post that will explain how the decisions worked for Fikes. Fan Bi, founder of Blank Label, an online custom shirt retailer: “Mr. Sims was fortunate to have Mr. Price as an informal adviser. I see Mr. Priceâs role as far more pivotal than that of the recruiter. Whether they are giving you fresh perspectives or reaffirming something you already suspected, advisers are white knights for entrepreneurs. Given that Mr. Sims was at the $4 million revenue mark, about to make his most senior hire and had a bad hiring track record, Mr. Price was definitely correct to encourage him to use a professional recruiter. My advice to Mr. Sims would be to suggest a more formal relationship with Mr. Price and create a scenario where Mr. Price wins if Mr. Sims wins. As the sole owner, I am sure Mr. Sims has a lot of lonely moments, and it’s really motivating when you have others who are really, really backing you.” Barry Kahn, chief executive of Qcue, which uses dynamic pricing software to help sports and entertainment organizations adjust ticket prices to market conditions: “Mr. Sims considered the benefits of reviewing resumes solo versus using a recruiter. However Iâd urge business owners to remember their extensive Rolodexes â an invaluable tool in the hiring process. Earlier this year, I began looking for a V.P. of business development. Initially, I thought my candidate would be someone who was already job hunting. After all, this is a young company and whoever joins would be taking some risk. However, after seeing a good friend leave a high-paying job at the N.B.A. to join a start-up, I realized that with risk, comes great reward, and many people are looking for just that in a career. When discussing our company with a respected contact I had met at a conference a year prior, he offered to introduce me to some people who would be good fits for us. Instead of accepting, I asked, ‘What would it take for you to be interested?’ Within two weeks he gave notice to his former employer. Within three months after he joined us, we tripled our client base. Laura Zander, owner of Jimmy Beans Wool, an online yarn retailer: “While I have yet to make my first senior hire, I have plenty of experience making lower-level hires without spending a ton of time and a fortune. My advice? Take advantage of your local university! Mr. Sims is fortunate to be located near two different universities: Portland State and the University of Puget Sound. When it comes to hiring entry-level people for our e-retail business, one of the greatest resources has been the local universityâs career center. Our local university, University of Nevada at Reno, has a free online service that lets us easily advertise jobs and internships to all of their students — part time, full time, traditional and nontraditional. To narrow the number of candidates, we can specify the subjects the applicants must be majoring in. To further limit the number of responses, we require that all applicants submit cover letters and their current G.P.A. We only consider rÃ©sumÃ©s from students with top-tier G.PA.’s. Weâve had tremendous luck finding both part-time and full-time employees this way — and rarely search for candidates any other way. Leisa Holland-Nelson, president of ContentActive, which sells Web-based management systems: “Our growth and experience was incredibly similar to Fikes’s. Our ‘aha’ moment was understanding and accepting the value the new hires brought to the top and bottom lines. Instead of thinking in terms of the expense of the salaries, and in this case also the recruiting fees, we learned to think in terms of revenue generated — i.e. instead of spending $60,000 salary, we earned $250,000 in billings. As soon as we made that transition, it was easier to engage a recruiter. However, with business tough for recruiters these days, we were able to negotiate a very reasonable per-hire rate, way below the standard. We also learned the hard way to check at least three references and do it ourselves. We asked the questions that mattered to our company and culture so we knew what to expect when the new hire arrived. That saved us time and money in acclimation and expectations. As an ex-recruiter myself, I should have known that but with the fast pace of our growth I let others handle it — a mistake. The key to successful hiring is to understand the process; have clear goals in mind for the new hire, salary and definition of success; and execute in a timely manner. Dragging anything out is treacherous. While it may seem a tedious process, the end result can make or break you.” You're the Boss offers an insider's perspective on small-business ownership.
