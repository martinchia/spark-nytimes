8:19 p.m. | Updated  Lawyers for Raj Rajaratnam have accused the government of a deliberate effort to taint the jury pool less than a week before the billionaire hedge fund manager goes on trial on charges of insider trading. In a court filing on Thursday, John Dowd, a lawyer for Mr. Rajaratnam, said that the Securities and Exchange Commissionâs proceeding filed on Tuesday against Rajat K. Gupta has generated âoverwhelming publicityâ that âhas seriously jeopardized Mr. Rajaratnamâs ability to seat an impartial and unbiased jury and has negatively impacted his Sixth Amendment rightsâ to a fair trial. âThere was no need to file these charges just one week before jury selection,â he added. The S.E.C. accused Mr. Gupta, a former director of Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble, of passing illegal tips about those companies to Mr. Rajaratnam, the founder of the Galleon Group. Mr. Rajaratnam, 53, is fighting the charges. His trial is set to begin on Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan. A lawyer for Mr. Gupta, Gary P. Naftalis, has called the S.E.C.âs charges âtotally baselessâ and said his client âhas done nothing wrong.â Thursdayâs filing includes a letter Mr. Dowd sent to the S.E.C. on Monday urging it to reconsider the timing of its charges against Mr. Gupta because of the negative impact it could have on Mr. Rajaratnamâs jury selection. In the letter, Mr. Dowd wrote that Mr. Gupta had given the S.E.C. âpowerful evidence that Mr. Gupta and Mr. Rajaratnam did not engage in insider trading in the stocks of Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble.â Mr. Dowd also said in the court filing that the United States attorneyâs office in Manhattan had ârequested the S.E.C. refrain from commencing an action but we have not seen any official correspondence to that effect.â He expressed frustration that federal prosecutors did not prevent the S.E.C. from bringing its action against Mr. Gupta.  “It is simply inexplicable that they did not act to stop this obvious pollution of the jury pool on the very day this court assembled the jury pool,” said Mr. Dowd. “Thus one is left to conclude that this was a deliberate attempt to pollute this jury pool and deny Mr. Rajaratnam his right to an impartial jury.”   Lawyers for Mr. Rajaratnam asked Judge Richard J. Holwell to allow for more questioning of prospective jurors and provide them with additional instructions that will address potential bias or knowledge of the case. The United States attorneyâs office declined to comment, as did an S.E.C. spokesman.  Advertisement
