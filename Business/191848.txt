The Securities and Exchange Commission announced on Tuesday that it had reached a settlement with the former chief financial officer of Beazer Homes USA to recover $1.4 million in bonus and stock profits. The executive, James OâLeary, received the money in the fiscal year 2006, a period when the home builder was committing accounting fraud, according to the S.E.C. release.  While Mr. OâLeary wasn’t charged with wrongdoing, the S.E.C. said it was required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the accounting compliance law, to recoup the money on behalf of Beazer.  “Sarbanes-Oxley Act encourages senior management to take affirmative steps to prevent fraudulent accounting schemes from occurring on their watch,â Rhea Kemble Dignam, director of the S.E.C.âs Atlanta Regional Office, said in a statement. âOâLeary received substantial incentive compensation and stock sale profits while Beazer was misleading investors and fraudulently overstating its income.â  The S.E.C. has flexed its regulatory muscle before in an effort to recover money from executives.  In March, Ian J. McCarthy, then the head of Beazer Homes, agreed to return nearly $6.5 million in cash plus stock holdings, as part of a settlement with the agency in which he neither admitted nor denied the allegations.  The court has to approve the settlement with Mr. OâLeary, who neither admitted nor denied the S.E.C.’s allegations.  Advertisement
