8:44 p.m. | Updated  The federal government is planning to sell a significant part of its shares in the American International Group — perhaps as much as one-fifth — in the first quarter of 2011 as it begins to unwind its ownership stake, people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday. The stock offering in A.I.G., the bailed-out insurer, could reach $15 billion, said these people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The discussions between A.I.G. and the government over the specifics of such a sale are occurring as the insurer makes progress in its plan to repay the $130 billion bailout. A.I.G. took a major step in carrying out that plan on Wednesday, disclosing in a regulatory filing that it had formalized the terms to pay back its obligations to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, including $20 billion of secured debt. It will also transfer other obligations to the Treasury Department. A.I.G. has long viewed repaying the New York Fedâs credit line as a necessity, removing a major source of debt and clearing the way for a sale of the Treasuryâs stock. Under the plan, A.I.G. will essentially shift its obligations from the New York Fed to the Treasury Department, which already owns about 79.9 percent of the company. A.I.G. has raised billions of dollars by selling assets, including major international life insurance operations, to help repay the Fed loan. When the deal announced on Wednesday closes — expected by March 15 — the Treasuryâs holdings will rise to slightly more than 92 percent of A.I.G. The federal government will then sell its shares over time, as it did with Citigroup and is doing with General Motors. âTodayâs announcement is a milestone in the governmentâs long-stated efforts to exit our investments in private companies as soon as practical while protecting taxpayers,â Tim Massad, acting assistant Treasury secretary for financial stability, said in a statement, referring to the A.I.G. regulatory filing. âWhen all is said and done, we believe taxpayers will recover every dollar invested in A.I.G. and stand a good chance of making a profit,â he said. A Treasury spokesman said in a statement that it was âprematureâ to speculate about the sale of the Treasuryâs A.I.G. shares. A.I.G.âs chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche, has said for months that he hoped the Treasury would begin selling its holdings in A.I.G. in the first quarter of 2011. He has cautioned that such a goal is dependent on the health of the stock markets. âWe hope to be able to go to the market with a public offering of A.I.G. this spring, but we have work to do to make that happen,â Mark Herr, an A.I.G. spokesman, said Wednesday in a statement. Still, A.I.G. and the Treasury Department have been heartened by the recent success of G.M.âs initial public offering and the governmentâs sale of its entire Citi stake. The events have been taken as signs that the stock markets are healthy enough to absorb large offerings. As with the G.M. and Citi stock sales, an A.I.G. offering provides the government with a difficult task: maximizing the price it can fetch while selling as many shares as possible. Shares in A.I.G. fell nearly 4 percent on Wednesday, closing at $42.22. They remain above $30 a share, which is considered the governmentâs break-even point for the bailout. A.I.G. has sought in recent months to show that it is becoming healthy again, after being bailed out in the financial crisis. Last month, it sold $2 billion in bonds, its first debt offering since fall 2008. News of the Treasuryâs intentions to sell A.I.G. stock early next year was first reported by Reuters. Advertisement
