The proxy battle involving the Telus Corporation, the $19 billion Canadian telecommunications company, is shaping up to be the most interesting of the year, involving allegations of empty voting, vote buying and secret share accumulations. What fun!   It began on Feb. 21, when Telus announced it would collapse its dual-class share structure. The two classes of shares are identical, except that one has voting rights.   The structure is a relic of Canadian government regulations and ownership restrictions, which cap Telusâs foreign ownership at 33.3 percent. In 1999, Verizon, based in the United States, acquired a 26 percent stake in Telus. To avoid running afoul of the rules, Telus issued nonvoting shares and listed them on the New York Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange. Telusâs voting shares remain listed only on the Toronto Stock Exchange.   The nonvoting shares have typically traded at a discount. On the eve of Telusâs move, the nonvoting stock sold at about $2 a share below the voting stock.  Telusâs plan to collapse its share classes did not recognize this difference. Instead, the nonvoting shares are to be exchanged for voting shares on a one-for-one basis.  Telus explains the decision by highlighting its organization documents, which provide for a one-to-one exchange if the Canadian government lifts the voting cap. In addition, there are other equal treatment provisions in the documents, including a requirement that the shares receive the same amount in a sale.   Telusâs announcement enticed American hedge funds. The Globe and Mail in Toronto has an excellent write-up of the hedge funds’ initial strategy — simply buy the nonvoting shares, and then short the voting shares. If the share collapse was approved, then the prices of the two classes should converge, with the nonvoting shares going up and the voting shares going down.   In anticipation of this trade, Telusâs shares initially moved in that direction, with the nonvoting shares trading up by 5.5 percent the day after the announcement and the voting shares rising less so by about 2.2 percent.   Mason Capital, a hedge fund with more than $2 billion in capital, stepped in and disrupted this strategy, however. In March, Mason bought 32,722,739 common shares and 602,300 voting shares. Mason also shorted 10,963,529 common shares and 21,672,700 voting shares.  The net economic effect of its bet is that Mason will profit if the dual-share class is not collapsed and the shares revert to their former trading value.  Because Canada only requires an interest this large to be reported at the end of the month, Mason was able to accumulate its position without the knowledge of the rest of the market.   Other hedge funds are probably changing course and following Masonâs strategy.  Foreign ownership has increased so much that on March 21, Telus was required to issue a news release stating that its restrictions on foreign ownership — no more than 33.3 percent — might be breached. Prior to this, Telus reported that its foreign ownership was below 20 percent.   On Monday, Mason started a proxy fight to oppose the share-class change.  Mason is claiming that voting shareholders would lose out. In other dual-share-class restructurings, including that of Telephone and Data Systems, which is based in the United States, the nonvoting shares were exchanged for the voting shares at a discount.  Here, Mason argues, no discount is being applied, giving the nonvoting shareholders an undeserved payment. Mason also cites a research report by Scotiabank, which claims that collapsing the shares will require foreign holders to sell 2.8 million Telus shares, given the foreign ownership restrictions.  Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory service, has typically recommended that a discount be applied in these situations, and it did so in the case of Telephone and Data Systems. But in this matter, I.S.S. has sided with Telus.   In a report released this week, I.S.S. said that the âincreased trading liquidity of a single, larger class of common shares; the additional market opportunity from a listing on the N.Y.SE.; and the elimination of any lingering investor uncertainty associated with a more complicated capital structure. …â mitigated against a premium being applied.  I.S.S. appeared to be particularly swayed because Telusâs organization documents already required such a conversion if the ownership cap was lifted, and that in other situations the nonvoting shares were illiquid, justifying a discount in exchange for the provided liquidity.  I see Telus and I.S.S.âs point. But the fact that there is a disparity between the two shares, probably because of the voting rights, seems to be a strong argument for a differential premium, even if such a conversion is likely to occur automatically in the future.   It is here that things get really interesting. Telus is accusing Mason of empty voting.  Empty voting is when a shareholder buys a substantial number of shares and simultaneously shorts the position in a roughly equivalent amount. The contrary positions mean the shareholder has no real economic stake in the company anymore, but can still vote the shares it holds.   Telus argues that Masonâs common-share position is offset by its short position in the nonvoting stock. The effect is that while Mason owns about $1.97 billion in stock, Masonâs economic exposure is only about $25 million.   Empty voting has been criticized because it divorces the economic interests in a share from the actual vote. This can be pernicious because it means a shareholder vote can be influenced in ways that might harm the company. But while empty voting has spurred much hand-wringing, to date there have been few examples of the potential ill effects, or even examples of empty voting at all.  The most prominent case was in 2004, and it involved the Perry Corporation’s purchase of shares in Mylan Pharmaceuticals, which was seeking to acquire King Pharmaceuticals at the time. In that instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission eventually fined Perry $100,000 for a failure to file a timely Schedule 13D report disclosing its position. To approve Telus’s proposal to collapse the share structure, two-thirds of the stock in each class are required to approve the move. Telus argues that Mason will have an outsize vote different than its economic position, and that this constitutes empty voting. Mason counters that it is merely hedging its position, and that its interests are set up to favor the voting shares, according to a person close to the money manager. You can draw your own opinion. But either way, Mason will have a head start in the vote since any share not voting is a no vote. Mason therefore already has about half the shares necessary to block the proposal.  Meanwhile, Telus is paying a dealer solicitation fee of 10 cents for each share of Telus stock voted in favor of the proposal. While this is fairly common in Canada, this looks like âvote buying,â the person close to Mason said. According to Mason’s public statements, the practice, which is forbidden in the United States, indicates that the hedge fundâs proxy solicitation has the support of some Telus shareholders.  All in all, it adds up to quite a ride for Telus — and for those who have the good fortune to watch these things only as case studies in how the capital markets can sometimes work in odd ways.   Perhaps this is also a warning for companies, including Google, that have proposed adopting a nonvoting share class.   Advertisement
