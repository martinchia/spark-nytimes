LONDON â The Spanish lender Banco Santander posted a sharply higher second-quarter profit of 1.1 billion euros on Tuesday, as it benefited from a fall in charges tied to delinquent loans. Santander, one of Europeâs largest banks by market capitalization, wrote off billions of dollars’ worth of faulty real estate loans last year, primarily in its home market, where record levels of unemployment and weak domestic growth continue to plague the Spanish economy. The drop in impairment charges allowed the bank to post an almost eightfold increase in second-quarter earnings, when compared with a profit of 123 million euros ($163 million) in the period a year earlier. The results were slightly below analystsâ estimates. Despite the gradual turnaround in its loan book, Santander had a setback in its Latin American business, which now represents more than half of its quarterly income. The firmâs Brazilian operations, in particular, had a weak quarter after reporting a 10 percent fall, to $558 million, in net profit compared with the year-ago period. The decline comes as Brazil’s economy is faltering amid continuing global financial uncertainty. âThe core Brazilian franchise is weaker than expected,â Citigroup analysts wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday. In Spain, the bankâs profit fell 57 percent, to 86 million euros, as the country continued to suffer from weak economic growth. Santander said the percentage of delinquent Spanish loans on its balance sheet rose 0.64 percentage point, to 4.76 percent, although the figure increased to 5.75 percent because of changes in how Spanish authorities calculate the overall figure. âProfits rose after more than two years of high levels of write-offs and reinforcement of capital,â Santanderâs chairman, Emilio BotÃ­n, said in a statement. âWe are preparing for a new period of profit growth.â Shares in Santander fell less than 1 percent in morning trading in Madrid on Tuesday. Santander said its core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of a bankâs ability to weather financial shocks, rose to 11.1 percent by the end of the second quarter, under the industry regulations known as Basel II.
