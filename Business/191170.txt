When Alibaba Group’s prospectus finally hit Wall Street on Tuesday, analysts and prospective investors eagerly tore into their fullest look yet at the company. One less-appreciated part of Alibaba’s data dump is its mergers strategy, one that will be important for the company as it seeks to augment its e-commerce empire. The company has already struck a number of deals, including takeovers of and investments in companies, both in China and in the United States.  Alibaba is clear about where it plans to put its ample financial resources — including $7.9 billion in cash on hand and $4.8 billion in free cash flow – to work: “We have made, and intend to continue to make, strategic investments and acquisitions to expand our user base, enhance our cloud computing business, add complementary products and technologies and further strengthen our ecosystem. For example, we expect to continue to make strategic investments and acquisitions relating to mobile, O2O services, digital media, category expansion as well as logistics services.” Though Alibaba has made news on this side of the Pacific Ocean lately for its deals in the United States — including investments in the car service Lyft and the messaging service Tango — the majority of its big deals remains centered on its home market of China. What’s clear is that, despite the amount of money Alibaba has spent in the United States, the company remains focused on investing in China. The e-commerce giant does nothing to hide its belief that its home market harbors the potential for much more growth. The e-commerce company has seized investor and public interest to an extent that is unusual for a company that does much of its business in China. In the prospectus, Alibaba specifically calls out what it describes as the “rising spending power of Chinese consumers,” trotting out a number of statistics to support the move. 
â The real consumption in China last year was 36.5 percent of gross domestic product last year, a little over half of the rate in the United States. By the company’s reckoning, that means Chinese spending has room to grow. â Just 45.8 percent of China was online, compared to 83.2 percent in the United States, according to government data. Even still, that percentage translates to about 618 million Chinese Internet users, and could grow to about 790 million in two years. â Online shopping accounted for just 7.9 percent of total consumption last year, though that is expected to grow about 27 percent a year through 2016, according to data from iResearch. â One obvious element of Alibaba’s focus has been mobile, driven by the country’s base of 500 million mobile Internet users. The document highlights the strides that Alibaba has already made in mobile. Citing data from iResearch, the company contended that it was responsible for 76 percent of all mobile merchandise sales in China last year. Indeed, the company has been in something of an competition against one of its chief rivals, the Internet media company Tencent, in acquiring toeholds in areas like mobile apps. Tencent has partnered Â with JD.com, another Chinese online retailer that is seen as a smaller competitor to Alibaba. And it has successfully built WeChat, a messaging services like Whatsapp, into one of China’s biggest apps and is moving to add a slew of e-commerce elements to the platform. Alibaba has responded with a series of investments in recent years, spending billions of dollars to acquire stakes in mobile companies, delivery logistics and content creators and distributors. The company helpfully breaks down some of its biggest transactions (which excludes the company’s biggest deal to date, its move to retake control of its Alibaba.com business-to-business marketplace): â Alibaba owns approximately 30 percent of Weibo, the biggest of China’s Twitter-like microblogging services, which recently conducted its own initial public offering. â It recently struck a deal to buy the 82 percent of AutoNavi, a Chinese mapping service listed in the United States, that it doesn’t already own for $1.1 billion. â Two months ago, it agreed to pay about $214 million for stock and about $478 million for convertible bonds to gain a roughly 26 percent stake in Intime Retail, a Chinese department store. As part of the deal, the two will form a venture to link Alibaba’s e-commerce offerings and Intime’s brick-and-mortar operation. â It invested about $1.1 billion to buy about 16.5 percent of Youku Tudou, one of China’s biggest Internet video companies. â It agreed to invest $805 million in the ChinaVision Media Group, a publicly traded producer of movies and TV programs. â It helped form China Smart Logistics, a provider of national delivery services, in which it has already invested $269 million. Alibaba said that it now owns 48 percent of the joint venture. Advertisement
