  Barnes & Nobleâs chairman, Leonard S. Riggio, disclosed on Tuesday that he had shelved his plan to buy the companyâs bookstores, as the embattled chain grapples with an uncertain future. His disclosure accompanied the retailerâs latest results, which included a loss that more than doubled from the same time last year. Mr. Riggio first announced his intention to bid for the companyâs 675 stores in February, a plan that essentially would have split the company in half. It was unclear how much he was willing to pay, but the board was said at one point to have been unwilling to consider any offer significantly short of $1 billion. Over the next several months, however, Mr. Riggio struggled with whether to follow through on his proposal, according to a person briefed on the matter. Mr. Riggio never made a formal offer to the board, and in recent weeks became leery of both the shareholder lawsuits that might arise from any bid and the distraction it might become to the company. Mr. Riggio, who is effectively running the company after the resignation of William J. Lynch Jr. as chief executive last month, would not be able to continue in that role if he had he made a formal offer. âWhile I reserve the right to pursue an offer in the future, I believe it is in the companyâs best interests to focus on the business at hand,â he said in a statement. Barnes & Noble has also halted discussions with Microsoft over a potential deal to sell the digital assets of Nook Media, which includes Barnes & Nobleâs troubled e-reader business. (Microsoft owns about 17.6 percent of the unit.) The companies are now in discussions about expanding their current partnership. Michael P. Huseby, Barnes & Nobleâs president, said in a phone interview that while the company was not necessarily looking to sell the stores, the Nook division or enter any other large transaction, the management team had not closed its mind to a potential deal if one arose. Mr. Riggioâs disclosure came on the same day Barnes & Noble reported a greater-than-expected loss of $87 million, or $1.56 a share, in the quarter ended July 27, up from a $39.8 million loss, or 76 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time items, the loss was 86 cents a share. Analysts had expected a loss of 81 cents a share. Overall revenue fell 8.5 percent, to $1.33 billion. Sales from the Nook business dropped 20 percent, to $153 million, while sales at the bookstores fell nearly 10 percent, to $1 billion. During a conference call on Tuesday about the companyâs earnings, Mr. Huseby also announced that Barnes & Noble had recommitted to making Nook devices. The move effectively reversed a plan announced under Mr. Lynch to discontinue making color devices. Mr. Huseby attributed part of the Nook operationsâ problems to unduly optimistic sales forecasts made under the previous management. Shares of Barnes & Noble tumbled 12 percent on Tuesday, to $14.61 A version of this article appears in print on 08/21/2013, on page B4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Barnes & Nobleâs Founder Will Not Pursue a Bid for the Bookstores.
