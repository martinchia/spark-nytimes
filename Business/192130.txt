Singapore Exchange‘s $7.9 billion takeover deal for ASX of Australia faced a new hurdle after prominent political leaders voiced concern about the deal, sending ASX shares down 5.5 percent, Reuters reported. Australia’s Greens Party, an influential bloc, said on Tuesday that it had strong concerns about the deal to create Asia’s fourth-largest stock exchange, while the main conservative opposition also questioned the deal. Political support for the transaction is necessary as Parliament needs to lift ASX’s 15 percent voting cap for the deal to go through. “It is too early to make that assumption that it is sort of a done deal,” said Matthew Smith, an analyst in Singapore for Macquarie. “The ASX shares had priced in a 60 percent probability of the deal being done yesterday. Now it is trading at a deeper discount. So it looks 50:50 for the deal,” he said. The stream of political comments sent ASX shares down as much as 8.6 percent on Tuesday after a 19.4 percent rise on Monday. By 0240 GMT, the shares were 5.2 percent lower, at A$39.6, 13 percent below the value of SGX’s offer. Go to Article from Reuters via The New York Times Â» Advertisement
