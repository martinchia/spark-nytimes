Cairn Energy chairman, Bill Gammell, has said that the way the India government deals with the proposed $9.6 billion sale of his companyâs Indian energy business to Vedanta will be a key pointer for future foreign investment in the country, The Financial Times reported. âItâs important this transaction be seen to be a smooth transaction from an investment point of view,â Mr. Gammell told the F.T. on Monday. âPeople will be watching very carefully as to how it takes place.â The Cairn-Vedanta deal concerns oil fields of strategic importance and the Indian government has already made clear its right to approve the sale, The Financial Times reported. The F.T. writes: [The Indian government] has so far been muted in its response to Cairnâs surprise August decision to sell a majority stake in its Indian subsidiary to Vedanta, the London-listed mining and metals group founded by Anil Agarwal, the Indian-born billionaire. Mr. Gammell told The F.T. he hoped that the go ahead would be given for the deal by the end of the year. Go to Article from The Financial Times (Subscription Required) Â» Advertisement
