Nels Olson is vice chairman and co-leader of the Board and C.E.O. Services Practice at Korn/Ferry International. American chief executives fall into two camps: those who relish opportunities to engage with Washington and those who engage only when threatened with a subpoena.  This notion of engagement is even more relevant at a moment when the United States is struggling with high unemployment, slow economic growth and yawning budget deficits.  In the coming months, Washington will be making decisions about federal spending and tax policy that will reshape the governmentâs fundamental role in the American economy for years to come. At the same time, both Congress and the Obama administration are under increasing pressure to find ways to create jobs and kick-start growth as the 2012 election approaches. As a result, chief executives and business leaders from companies of all shapes and sizes will almost certainly find their local representatives and senators eager to hear a private-sector perspective from outside the Beltway.  Ivan Seidenberg, the former chief executive and chairman of Verizon, fits the archetype of the corporate leader who sees the long-term benefit of having a presence in the capital. As chief executive, he frequently met with regulators, members of Congress and White House officials (including invitations to speak with the president with other chief executives). President Obama named him to the Presidentâs Export Council in July 2010, and he served for three years as chairman of the Business Roundtable, the Washington-based group that advocates  pro-business policies. Among the senior executives working for him at Verizon are a former congressman and Verizon executive vice president for public affairs, Thomas Tauke; and a former general counsel for the United States trade representative, Peter Davidson, now senior vice president for government relations at Verizon. Also among them, until 2008, was William B. Barr, a former attorney general of the United States.  âIâve focused on Washington because itâs essential to the long-term health of Verizon, but also because I want to help develop solutions to the nationâs pressing problems,â  Mr. Seidenberg said.    As the White House, policy makers and legislators grapple with issues like deficit reduction, spending cuts and tax changes, engaging Washington is critical for corporate leaders, given the ramifications of regulation, taxation, global trade and more. While this is understood by top executives like  Mr. Seidenberg and others, there is a clear need for leaders from outside the Fortune 500 to similarly ratchet up their efforts to have their voice heard and address what Mr. Seidenberg has characterized as âa growing disconnect between Washington and the business community.â  The federal government and, to a lesser extent, state government are deeply entwined in sectors throughout the American economy. Regulation, in particular, can affect companies significantly and in unexpected ways, given that statutes are regularly being modified in a range of areas, including environmental protection, consumer privacy and workplace conditions. It is far preferable to try to influence the process than be stuck responding to the result.   âIf youâre not engaged, you can wake up one morning and find a big problem on your hands,â said  Jim McNerney, chairman, president and chief executive of Boeing, who is acutely aware of the need to develop relationships in Washington, given that the company is consistently the second-largest recipient of United States  government contracts after Lockheed Martin. There is some evidence that companies increasingly recognize the likelihood of public policy’s affecting  their operations, based on the findings of a McKinsey global survey of business executives in February. Among survey respondents from companies in North America, 71 percent said they expected increased involvement from both government and regulators â the highest percentage of any region in the world.  Another indicator is that membership in the Business Roundtable, which represents chief executives of leading American  companies, has increased to 205 from 143  over the past 12 months.     The engagement of chief executives with Washington can take many forms. The traditional steps of making campaign contributions, joining trade associations and hiring government relations staff members remain important. But they are no longer sufficient. Mr. McNerney of Boeing recommends that work on public policy issues become one of the experiences expected of executives as they rise through ranks toward the chief executiveâs  office. âIt is more important than ever to have experience with Washington built into the background of people who run companies,â he said. Reinforcing the importance of chief executive involvement is the proliferation of advocacy efforts by those who are not chief executives. In 2010, there were nearly 13,000 registered lobbyists in Washington. The large number of lobbyists creates more competition for companies as they seek to deliver their message to policy makers.  âYou canât outsource the Washington knowledge to external lobbyists or your in-house government relations people,â says Bill Green, chairman and former chief executive  of Accenture. âAs a C.E.O., you have to have some level of depth on the issues of the day and the issues that could affect your company in the future. Relying solely on the government relations folks to raise the red flag is not sufficient and does not serve your shareholders well. In todayâs world, you have to be part of the ongoing dialogue.â But even with their stature and mastery of issues, chief executives must be prepared for challenges and frustrations, said  David Cote, chief executive of Honeywell. âThereâs generally no one person you can talk to who can make the decision.â  âBecause Washington has 536 independent subcontractors, you have to do a lot of talking and a lot of participating to get buy-in,â Mr. Cote said, referring to the president and all members of Congress. âThat can be frustrating for us who are used to talking to one person and getting a problem solved. But thatâs the way it works, and you have to participate.â Washington engagement is undeniably a form of risk management â developing the relationships with officials that can help a chief executive  to resolve differences (policy or otherwise) before they strike at the heart of a  companyâs brand or balance sheet. But engagement should not be viewed entirely as a defense mechanism. Being positioned to shape policies as they develop, and to seize opportunities emanating from policy changes, can also be a catalyst for corporate growth. And a healthy, vibrant relationship between chief executives and Washington, resting on communication and cooperation, will ultimately translate to a stronger, more dynamic economy that can deliver higher levels of job creation and greater prosperity for the American people.
