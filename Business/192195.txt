Writing today on the op-ed page of The Washington Post, Robert Pozen makes the case that liberals should support changes to Social Security. Mr. Pozen is a Democrat, though not necessarily a liberal one; he is a financial executive who served on President George W. Bush’s Social Security commission and in Mitt Romney’s administration in Massachusetts. But his argument is worth considering, whether you’re liberal or conservative.  First, he points out that Social Security is less progressive than it seems. Low-wage workers may receive more in annual benefits than they pay into the system. But they also don’t live as long as higher-wage workers, which reduces their lifetime benefits. Mr. Pozen suggests that a reform of Social Security could and should make it more progressive than it is today. That notion is likely to be more appealing to liberals than the notion that Social Security is is running out of money, which many question. Conservatives, of course, may bristle at the idea of Social Security becoming more progressive — with taxes rising on high-wage workers and benefits rising for lower-wage workers. But there is good response to this concern: over the last 30 years, taxes rates have fallen much more for the affluent than for any other group, while their pre-tax incomes have risen much more. Mr. Pozen doesn’t make that point, but he does make a related one:   … the progressivity of Social Security should be looked at in the broader context of federal support for retirement savings. The federal government confers more than $100 billion in tax benefits each year on participants in employer-sponsored retirement programs. These benefits flow almost entirely to middle and high earners, who generally participate in their employersâ retirement plans. By contrast, the employers of many low-paid workers do not offer retirement plans â and if they do, more low-wage workers do not have the financial leeway to make the necessary contributions. Because of the differential impact of these tax benefits, the overall federal approach to retirement is regressive.  Mr. Pozen’s suggested agenda includes: * Raising the cap on earnings subject to the payroll tax, from $106,800 to $170,000. This would restore to the tax to its original benchmark of covering 90 percent of all wages. Since the payroll tax is hefty — 12.4 percent of earnings, split between employer and employee — Congress seems unlikely to extend the full tax to $170,000. “Nevertheless,” Mr. Pozen writes, “Congress might impose a surcharge — for example, 1 or 2 percent, on all wages over the current ceiling, up to $1 million per year.” * Slowing the future growth of benefits for high earners. Currently, the level of initial benefits that a recipient receives rises with economywide wages, rather than with prices, which allows future retirees to enjoy some of the rise in living standards that workers do. Mr. Pozen suggests keeping this system in place for lower-wage workers while reducing the growth of benefits for higher-wage workers to something between general inflation and economywide wage increases. * Raising the retirement age beyond the currently planned age of 67, but exempting lower-wage workers. The gap in life expectancy between the affluent and the poor, Mr. Pozen explains, “is likely to increase over the next few decades as the costs of breakthrough medical therapies rise.” Obviously, the details of any such plan would be important. Above all, what’s the definition “low wage” and “high wage”?  The Times’s deficit calculator includes a version of several such options, and it allows you to look at how much money they might save. For those who doubt that Social Security faces a deficit, I’ve written this primer. Floyd Norris, the chief financial correspondent of The New York Times, covers the world of finance and  economics.
