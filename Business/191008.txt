 Insider trading is all about propitious timing. And trades by the golfer Phil Mickelson and  William T. Walters, a high-rolling gambler, just before the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn made an unsolicited offer to buy Clorox in 2011 have all the signs of a potential violation: a quick increase in the stock price that made their risky call options worth millions of dollars. But timing alone is not enough to establish insider trading. So moving from suspicion to proving a violation requires much more than just timely trading and vague connections between a potential source and profitable trades.  The Securities and Exchange Commission learned that lesson once again about how difficult it can be to prove insider trading last Friday, when a jury rejected securities fraud charges against Nelson Obus and two other defendants.  After a four-year investigation and eight years of litigation, which included a dismissal of the case that was later overturned by an appeals court, the S.E.C. could not show a violation for trading right before a deal was announced that generated profits of more than $1 million. The S.E.C.âs theory was that an analyst at Mr. Obusâs investment advisory firm passed him a tip about an impending acquisition of SunSource from a college friend who was an analyst at General Electric. G.E. was considering financing the deal.  The evidence included a conversation that Mr. Obus had with SunSourceâs chief executive before the deal was announced.  Mr. Obus was accused of telling the executive that âa little birdie in Connecticutâ — where G.E. is located — had told him about the transaction.  Animal references can be enough to prove a case, as happened in one instance during the binge of insider trading prosecutions in the 1980s. Robert Freeman, who was once chief of risk arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs & Company, pleaded guilty based on receiving a tip about a deal about to collapse when he was told, âYour bunny has a good nose.â  Unlike many criminal insider trading cases seen recently in which the defendants did not testify, in a civil case, the S.E.C. can call a defendant to the witness stand. If the defendant asserts the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and refuses to answer questions, that can be considered as evidence of a violation. Mr. Obus testified at his trial, denying that he had received any inside information and that he bought the shares based on extensive research. His lawyer argued to the jury that his client must be âthe lamest insider trader in historyâ if he told the chief executive of a company that he had confidential information about an impending deal and then waited two weeks before buying its shares. The Obus case comes on the heels of other recent trial losses in which well-timed trading was not enough to establish a violation after defendants testified they did not misuse confidential information.  In November 2013, in S.E.C. v. Schvacho, a Federal District Court judge in Georgia rejected insider trading charges against a defendant who had a longtime friendship with a chief executive negotiating his companyâs acquisition. There was evidence of numerous telephone calls and meetings between the two men during the negotiations, but both men vehemently denied at trial that any confidential information was disclosed. The circumstantial evidence of their discussions could not overcome the absence of any proof that confidential information was shared.  A jury rejected insider trading charges against Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, for selling shares after he spoke with the companyâs chief executive about an impending transaction that would drive down the price of its stock. Mr. Cuban aggressively denied making any agreement about selling his shares, while the S.E.C. had to rely on the video testimony of the chief executive because he refused to come to the United States for the trial. Quick profits from trading can be enticing evidence that confidential information was misused, but it can wilt in the face of strong denials of wrongdoing by the trader who provides a plausible alternative explanation for the transactions. When defendants insist on their innocence, a jury may be willing to give them the benefit of the doubt if the case lacks evidence, like a recorded conversation or incriminating emails, to undermine the claim. In the investigation of trading by Mr. Mickelson and Mr. Walters in Clorox, DealBook reported that the government was searching for evidence to link their well-timed trades to Mr. Icahn or any other inside source at the company. To build a case, the Justice Department and the S.E.C. need evidence from a reliable source to show a likely pipeline for information. Even then, the recent trial losses in insider trading cases are a warning that the government should tread carefully in pursuing a case absent testimony from an individual involved in the trading or other credible evidence to show how confidential information was misused. Public figures like Mr. Mickelson and Mr. Icahn would probably be effective witnesses on their own behalf if charges were ever filed. So just asking a jury to disbelieve them to prove a case is unlikely to be sufficient. When defendants put up a united front and deny trading on inside information, the government has to do more to meet its burden than just relying on outsize profits from well-timed trading to prove a violation.
