Wall Street is entering an uncertain new era as the Volcker Rule â the regulation at the heart of Washingtonâs efforts to rein in financial risk-taking â takes hold, Ben Protess and Peter Eavis report in DealBook. The rule, a copy of which was reviewed by The New York Times, imposes some requirements that are tougher than the banks had wanted. Five federal agencies are expected to vote to approve it on Tuesday â though some might do so in private because of inclement weather in the Washington area. (One of them, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has canceled its public meeting.) The Volcker Rule has become a litmus test for the overall strength of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. And yet some critics say that the rule, which aims to draw a line between everyday banking and Wall Street trading, does not go far enough. Regulators agreed to delay it until July 2015. Wall Street, for its part, is expected to scour the rule for loopholes and consider whether to challenge it in court. The rule bans banks from trading for their own gain, a practice known as proprietary trading. âIn recent weeks, regulators who favored a more stringent version of the rule pressed for changes that they think will make it harder for banks to evade the regulation. The version of the rule reviewed by The Times shows that, in some areas, the hard-liners got their way,â Mr. Protess and Mr. Eavis write. âThe rule, for example, includes new wording aimed at the sort of risk-taking responsible for a $6 billion trading loss at JPMorgan Chase last year.â The Volcker Rule also requires chief executives to attest that they have established programs for complying with the rule. âThe C.E.O. of the banking entity must, annually, attestâ to regulators that the bank âhas in place processes to establish, maintain, enforce, review, test and modify the compliance program,â according to the copy reviewed by The Times, which is dated Friday. An October 2011 draft of the rule did not include such a mandate. “But it could have been even tougher,â according to the DealBook report. âSome critics of Wall Street wanted the executives to attest that their bank was actually in compliance with the rule, not just taking steps to comply.â  MANDELAâS FREE MARKET LEGACY Â |Â âWhen you think about Nelson Mandela, you probably think about freedom â free people, free country, free speech. What may be overshadowed by Mr. Mandelaâs extraordinary legacy was his complicated journey to support free markets and a free economy,â Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. When he was released from prison in 1990, Mr. Mandela said he believed in the nationalization of South Africaâs main businesses, but two years later he changed his mind, embracing capitalism, and charted a new economic course for his country. âThe story of Mr. Mandelaâs evolving economic view is eye-opening: It happened in January 1992 during a trip to Davos, Switzerland, for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. Mr. Mandela was persuaded to support an economic framework for South Africa based on capitalism and globalization after a series of conversations with other world leaders,â Mr. Sorkin writes.    HOW VIRTUAL CURRENCY POSES LEGAL CHALLENGES Â |Â âBitcoin itself is neither good nor bad, just a new means to conduct business, but virtual currency operates in ways that make it harder to prosecute violations,â Peter J. Henning writes in the White Collar Watch column. âThe value of the Bitcoins available now is quite small, totaling approximately $12 billion. Yet the perception that growing acceptance of virtual currencies will change the way business operates means governments will have to figure out how to deal with new forms of crime.â “There is a Wild West quality to Bitcoin, created out of a libertarian bent that connotes a world beyond government regulation. Like any currency, it carries with it a degree of anonymity, much as the phrase âcash is an orphanâ signals that money can be largely untraceable once put into circulation. More than ordinary cash, though, Bitcoin operates largely outside the current banking system, making it even more difficult to trace transactions.â  ON THE AGENDA Â |Â The Senate is expected to vote on the nomination of Melvin L.

STOCK Â |Â The government bailout of General Motors came to a close on Monday with the Treasury Departmentâs announcement that it had sold the last of what was once a 60 percent stake in the company, Bill Vlasic and Annie Lowrey report in DealBook. The sale allows the nationâs biggest automaker to continue its comeback without the stigma of being known as âGovernment Motors.â Taxpayers lost about $10 billion on their $49.5 billion investment in the automaker. But over all, taxpayers have ended up in the black on the crisis-related bailouts, Treasury officials said, recovering $433 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program after initially investing about $422 billion. âWith the final sale of G.M. stock, this important chapter in our nationâs history is now closed,â Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said.
