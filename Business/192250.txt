LONDON â The reclamation project that started three years ago at the Lloyds Banking Group with the arrival of AntÃ³nio Horta-OsÃ³rio as chief executive appears to be far from complete. Lloyds may cut as many as 9,000 jobs, or about 10 percent of its work force, and close some branches as the banks seeks to reshape its business for the digital age, a person briefed on the discussions said on Thursday. With such a target, this means that Lloyds will have eliminated more than 40,000 jobs since 2008, when it agreed to a poorly timed acquisition of the mortgage lender HBOS, the operator of Halifax and Bank of Scotland, as the financial crisis hit. Bad loans, many from the HBOS acquisition, and a weaker economic environment ultimately forced Lloyds to accept a government bailout in 2009 of roughly 17 billion pounds, or about $27 billion. The British government still owns about 25 percent of the bank. But Lloyds has seen its outlook improve steadily in recent years. In 2010, it became one of the first bailed-out banks to return to profitability. The British government, through two sales in the last year, has been able to reduce its stake in Lloyds at a profit. And because the bank was primarily focused on the British consumer and business markets, it has not had to go through the same level of pain as some of its competitors in shedding overseas assets and exiting riskier business lines. This year, Mr. Horta-OsÃ³rio declared that Lloyds was once again becoming a “normal” bank and announced plans to seek permission to resume paying a dividend to investors. Still, Lloyds and many of its competitors continue to wrestle with customers’ drastically changing habits. Fewer people are walking into branches to make deposits and an increasing number of consumers are conducting their financial lives almost exclusively online or on mobile phones. In a report issued this year, the British Bankersâ Association said the use of online banking had risen 40 percent in Britain from 2009 to 2013. The trade group found that British bank customers used online banking services almost 800,000 times an hour last year. Numbers like that prompted Royal Bank of Scotland, a Lloyds rival, to announce plans this year to spend Â£1 billion in its consumer and small-business banking operations over the next three years to improve digital services. Those plans include adding more A.T.M.s to take deposits and transforming its branches from locations focused mostly on transactions to centers for financial advice and education. Lloyds, which operates more than 2,000 branches in Britain, is facing a similar situation. Branches remain a significant driver of deposits, which are particularly important as regulators impose greater capital requirements in hopes of making the financial system stronger and avoiding future government bailouts. But branches cost a lot of money, and more consumers are turning to their phones or their laptops to move money. Lloyds has about 10 million customers who regularly use digital services and roughly 5 million who primarily use their phones for banking. The bank is expected to give investors an update on its strategic plan for the next three years when it releases its third-quarter results next week. That plan update will very likely include the job reductions, said a person briefed on the lenderâs plans who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The number of cuts has not been finalized, but could reach 9,000, the person said. Lloyds declined to comment on Thursday. The Times of London reported this month that Lloyds was contemplating thousands of job cuts, and Sky News reported on Wednesday that 9,000 jobs could disappear. The job reductions will not be as severe as previous ones of 28,000 in 2008 and 15,000 in 2011, but are the latest step in the evolution of Lloyds. It has already shed 631 branches by spinning off the TSB Banking Group in an initial public offering in June, and the bank expects to completely divest itself of its TSB holdings by the end of 2015.
