Goldman Sachs has named Pete Lyon co-head of the investment-banking unit that covers private equity firms. The announcement comes a day after the firm announced the retirement of Milton R. Berlinski, a 26-year Goldman veteran who had run the unit alongside Alison Mass.   Mr. Lyon has worked at Goldman since 1990, and for much of that time has worked with the firm’s private equity clients. Earlier in his career, he worked in a group that provided loans to finance private equity firms’ acquisitions. He spent much of the last decade covering some of the firm’s most important private equity relationships during the leveraged buyout boom, and then did a short stint in Dubai covering clients in the Middle East and North Africa.  In an interview this month with the Harvard Business School newspaper, Mr. Lyon doled out career advice for aspiring bankers. “I think you need to look at investment banking as a marathon rather than a sprint,” he said. Mr. Lyon also said that while he was a student at the school, he wished he had spent more time at The Tasty, the now-defunct greasy spoon in Cambridge, Mass., that was featured in the movie “Good Will Hunting” and served a killer double cheeseburger.     Here is the memo from Goldman Sachs on Mr. Lyon’s promotion: We are pleased to announce that Pete Lyon will become co-head of the Financial Sponsors Group in the Americas alongside Alison Mass.   Pete joined the firm in 1990 as an analyst in the Debt Capital Markets Group (DCM) where he worked until departing for graduate school in 1993.  In 1995, he rejoined DCM and in 1996 transferred to the Leveraged Finance Group to focus on acquisition financings for the firmâs financial sponsor clients.  In 2000, he assumed responsibility for private equity client relationship management in the Financial Sponsors Group.  In 2008, Pete relocated to Dubai, where he was head of client coverage for the MENA region.  In 2010, he returned to New York to lead client coverage strategy for the division in the Executive Office.  Pete was named managing director in 2003 and partner in 2006.   Please join us in congratulating Pete and wishing him continued success in his new role. Richard J. Gnodde
