 ConAgra Foods reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue because of higher sales in its commercial foods division, which makes ingredients for other manufacturers and restaurants. It also forecast a modest recovery in profit and revenue in its underperforming private-brands business and said it expected its focus on healthier options like low-fat meals would bolster its consumer brands business this year. As with General Mills, ConAgra’s consumer brands — particularly Healthy Choice, Orville Redenbacher’s popcorn and Chef Boyardee pasta — have suffered as consumers choose healthier meals and cook more at home. ConAgra reported a net loss of $324.2 million, or 77 cents a share, compared with a profit of $192.2 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items such as restructuring costs, ConAgra earned 55 cents a share. Revenue fell almost 3 percent to $4.44 billion, but beat the average analyst forecast for $4.40 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company earned $2.17 a share in its 2014 fiscal year. A version of this brief appears in print on June 27, 2014, on Page B2 of the New York edition with the headline: Revenue at Conagra Foods Is Better Than Expected.
