Rajat K. Gupta, the former Goldman Sachs and Procter & Gamble director accused of leaking confidential information about those companies, has stepped down from another corporate board. AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, said in a securities filing on Monday that Mr. Gupta had “voluntarily resigned from the boards” of AMR and American Airlines. He had joined the board in 2008. On March 1, the Securities and Exchange Commission brought a civil case against Mr. Gupta, accusing him of passing along information on Goldman and Procter & Gamble earnings to Raj Rajaratnam, the co-founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund, whose trial on securities fraud and conspiracy charges starts on Tuesday.  Mr. Gupta, 62, was a longtime executive at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company and ran the firm from 1994 to 2003.  He stepped down from the board of Goldman in May and from P.&G.’s board on March 1.  Gary Naftalis, a lawyer for Mr. Gupta, has called the S.E.C. accusations “totally baseless.” Advertisement
