The âgo shopâ on Wall Street is quickly becoming a âno shop.â After an acquisition is announced, the target company often has the opportunity to solicit higher bids from potential suitors, in whatâs known as the go-shop process â as in âgo shopâ for a better deal. The buyer is supposed to act as a stalking horse, attracting other, more lucrative offers. The go-shop provision, a relatively new phenomenon in the last few years, has been heralded by governance experts as a best practice for boards. Ideally, the directors, having already guaranteed a minimum price tag, run an auction for the company, seeking a better price. But as the recent sale of J. Crew and other management-led buyouts show, the go-shop process looks more like window dressing â a way to subvert a true auction and enrich management. Boards also see it as a way to shield themselves from shareholder lawsuits. After all, directors, hiding behind a go-shop, can always say: âWe tried to get a higher price, and this was the best offer available.â Just look at J. Crew. Millard S. Drexler, the âmerchant princeâ behind the resurrection of the preppy retailer, arranged a management-led buyout with two private equity firms, TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners. By the time Mr. Drexler, known as Mickey, notified other directors weeks later, the deal was a fait accompli. The board blessed the buyout in November. But it also inserted a go-shop clause to protect itself. No bidders submitted binding offers over the next 85 days. J. Crewâs shareholders are supposed to vote on the deal on Tuesday. Institutional Shareholder Services, the proxy advisory firm, has recommended that shareholders block the buyout, suggesting there are âserious issues in the sales process that gave TPG a significant advantage.â The advisory firm also called the go-shop provision âquestionable.â As of late Monday, investors seemed ready to reject the sale unless the buyers raised their bid. In many deals, the go-shop process is looking like a fake effort at good governance. Last year, 20 management-led buyouts included such a provision, according to Capital IQ, a firm that tracks deal data. Higher offers rarely emerged. One exception: The Hardeeâs and Carlâs Jr. fast-food chain spurned a deal with THL Partners in favor of a richer offer from Apollo Management. Apollo paid $12.55 a share in cash; THL had bid $11.05 a share. But in most cases, the structure of the deals may be spooking potential bidders. Incumbent managers, said Guhan Subramanian, a Harvard professor who studied the effectiveness of a go-shop period, have âa significant advantage over other potential buyers.â The case of J. Crew makes it clear why. The retailer’s chief, in a cloud of secrecy, teamed up with TPG and Leonard Green to make a deal. Mr. Drexler relaxed his stance and agreed to consider other suitors, after shareholders sued J. Crew. But the die was cast at that point. What buyers would want to work with a chief executive who clearly didnât want to work with them? In fairness, one defense of the go-shop process is hard to ignore. The buyers tend to pay higher premiums upfront, making it harder for an interloper to intercede. According to Capital IQ, deals that included a go-shop provision had a 39 percent premium compared with deals without such a provision, which had only a 16 percent premium. âThe premiums are so high, who wants to bid even higher?â said Richard Peterson, director of valuation and risk strategies at Standard & Poorâs. Ultimately, it comes back to whether the bidding process is competitive and shareholders get the best deal. A Delaware Chancery Court judge called that into question in the management-led buyout of Del Monte. In November, the food makerâs board agreed to a deal with a private equity giant, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company. The terms included a go-shop period that ended in early January. Not surprisingly, no other suitors stepped forward. The judge, Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster, criticized the cozy deal in a recent ruling. The Barclays bankers advising Del Monte, he said, âhad a keen desire to see the deal close with K.K.R.â The British bank was also providing financing to the private equity buyer. The judge declared that Barclays had âsecretly and selfishly manipulated the sale process.â  Advertisement
