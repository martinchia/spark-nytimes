Are you getting the most out of your business? In 1995, I sold my vending business and decided to start a wealth management firm for private business owners. Much to my surprise, selling the vending company turned out to be a long and convoluted journey, one I wish I never had to take. I had put more than 25 years into learning the family vending business. Our company provided great service, and we had really figured out how to exceed our customersâ expectations. The problem we had was we just could never get the company to the point where we were making a reasonable profit. Eventually, I saw the writing on the wall. It was only a matter of time before we would move from minimal profits to minimal losses. And it was easy to see that in just a few years those minimal losses would most likely turn into large losses and even bankruptcy.  We came close to selling the company in 1993, when we had an offer on the table that I thought was acceptable. In fact, I accepted it — and I thought we were almost over the finish line. But it turned out I had a lot to learn about how businesses are sold. In fact, agreeing on an initial price was just one step in a very long process. Next came due diligence. The buyers came in and started looking at our company. All they did was find fault with everything we did. And every time they found something wrong, they decided it was a good idea to lower the price they were willing to pay. Of course, I disagreed with all of their findings. But this was the first time I had been through the process as a seller, and I really didnât understand how it worked. Previously, when I had bought companies, I then realized, my own due diligence had been much less thorough — and as a result we made a lot of mistakes. By contrast, my prospective buyers adopted an attitude of complete mistrust. They used the due diligence process as a way to renegotiate the deal. If the economy had not started to get significantly better I might have thought I had no choice and gone ahead and sold them the company. Instead I told them to go away and planned to own the company for the long run. Little did I know that the long run would last only two more years. For a while after the sale fell through, the company did well. We had profits and, more important, we had positive cash flow. At the same time, there was something going on that we did not notice at first. Our customers were businesses and factories, but every year, a few plants in our market area would close. The ones that did stay in business employed fewer people. As a result, we started to see a drop in same-location sales. Suddenly, we had to find new business just to keep our annual revenue steady. In addition, as we came to understand, the industry was facing an insidious problem — a dirty little secret. Many vending companies were using software that allowed them to keep two sets of books. This was important because in the industry it is customary for vending companies to pay their clients a commission on all products sold. With double books, a vending company could promise a client a 20 percent commission but then really pay only a 7 percent commission. The first set of books was for the customer and showed sales reduced by a certain amount that commissions were paid on. This was called the R factor in the industry — the R standing for sales reduction. The second set of books was what the account actually did and was used to prepare the company’s records. By 1993, we had exited every segment of the industry where clients awarded their vending contracts solely on the basis of price and commissions. We had learned that the amount we were able to pay in commissions was always far lower than the amount promised by the winning bidder. It became more and more clear that for us to stay in the vending business we were going to have to adopt the same questionable practices as our competitors. I considered this for about 10 seconds and then decided it just didnât fit with our companyâs business practices. For a while, we had managed to prosper by pursuing private companies that still cared about service — and not just price and commissions. But by early 1995, I saw that it was only a matter of time before even our best clients stopped caring about the quality of our service. At one point, we went after a large bakery with several locations. We helped the company understand that its food service use had been poor and that its employees were not being offered products they valued enough to buy. The company agreed to move its business to our company. But when we were just about to order new equipment to install on the property, we got a call. Our contact at the company said that its current vendor had just come in with a quote for a 27 percent commission. Our quote was for 5 percent — that was the best we could do and make a reasonable profit. Around this time, the buyers we had walked away from in 1993 called and said they were still interested in buying our company. This time, I listened and we set ground rules that allowed us to get past due diligence successfully. The sale closed near the end of 1995. Looking back today, I realize that I was lucky to have made the deal when I did. If I hadnât, I have no doubt that I would have had to liquidate the company through bankruptcy.
