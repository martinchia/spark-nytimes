 David Zaring is associate professor of legal studies at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. The insurance company MetLife is unhappy that it has been added to the list of firms that get special attention from regulators for being too big, or too interconnected, to fail. It appears to want to fight the designation by arguing that the government has not provided the numbers supporting its analysis, and that this failure to do the math makes the designation unreasonable, and, therefore, illegal. The case is a nice illustration of a larger debate about when the government should be forced to justify its regulatory initiatives by establishing, with numbers, that the benefits outweigh the costs. MetLife will face an uphill fight, but the lawyer hired by the insurer to make its case has managed to get the federal courts to require the Securities and Exchange Commission to produce quantitative cost-benefit analyses justifying its regulatory initiatives. By hiring him, the insurer appears to hope he can have the same effect on a different government decision maker. The widening scope of the governmentâs too-big-to-fail designations has spread ripples of alarm across the financial sector. The initial designations covered banks alone. But regulators have started to worry about every kind of money manager in the country. MetLife is the third insurance company to be designated, and it is certainly big; it has written almost $1 trillion worth of coverage. The government has also made noises about designating the countryâs largest asset managers — Blackstone alone has more than $280 billion in assets under management. To regulators, the systemically important question is easy: What would you do if companies of this size ran into financial difficulties? Of course, Microsoft is large, too, and we donât make it hold onto earnings to create a capital buffer large enough to deal with macroeconomic shocks. Insurance companies and asset managers are not leveraged financial institutions. They do not borrow short to lend long, as banks do, to take  advantage of the maturity mismatch that is usually so productive, but occasionally so illiquid. That difference is the basic argument behind MetLifeâs case against designation. But a large component of the argument is likely to be about numbers. To win its case, MetLife has to establish that the government acted âarbitrarily.â The designation would be reviewed by the courts to see, first, if regulators had considered the relevant facts, applied the relevant law and explained how they got to their decision. And even if the regulators’ actions passed muster, the courts would have to consider, second, whether the decision was unreasonable. It is a deferential standard of review — judges have been particularly unwilling to second-guess the decisions of regulators concerned with financial stability.  But in two prior designations of nonbanks, the government justified its concern in prose. It did not do a cost-benefit analysis in support of the designation, justify its concern by running a model against a spreadsheet of the firmsâ assets or go through the exercise of a stress test. In short, the government did not use math to defend its designation. Should it be required to do so?  Cass Sunstein, President Obamaâs first regulatory czar and now a law professor at Harvard, has said he believes that agencies should make the quantitative case whenever possible. Another Harvard Law professor, John Coates, on the other hand, argues that the assumptions involved in assessing the costs and benefits of financial regulation look too much like ever-changing guesstimates. Eugene Scalia, MetLifeâs newly hired lawyer, has had some luck in requiring the Securities and Exchange Commission to show its work mathematically. That agency, however, has to justify its rules under a statute that requires it to consider efficiency, competition and capital formation. Mr. Scalia, in an impressive feat of lawyering, persuaded a series of appellate courts that the reference required a quantitative cost-benefit analysis justifying the rules, unless there was reason to think that the costs and benefits were impossible to quantify. Mr. Scalia, the son of Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court, will have a difficult time achieving a similar outcome in this case. Congress gave the government 10 factors to take into account when making a too-big-to-fail designation. This sort of multiple-factor test all but requires regulators to balance values that have different degrees of quantifiability. Some can be counted, like the amount of leverage and off-balance sheet exposure. But others like âthe nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness and mix of the activities of the companyâ have so many moving parts, some of them difficult to quantify, that expressing them mathematically may not be worth the effort. The government has also been given the leeway to consider âany other risk-related factors” that it deems appropriate, a standard that encourages judges to defer to regulators.  Moreover, the S.E.C. has a tradition of writing rules that will be subject to searching review.  Everyone knows that there will be a lawsuit after each of its major initiatives, and that the judicial review will be searching. The courts have, so far, given the Financial Stability Oversight Council a free pass at every turn. The council’s mandate — to protect the stability of the financial system — is not one that judges feel comfortable second-guessing. Perhaps for this reason, the previously designated insurance companies — A.I.G. and Prudential — protested their designations but decided against pursuing a lawsuit. Finally, the courts where Mr. Scalia won his earlier cost-benefit cases have become more deferential to agencies as more judges appointed by President Obama have been appointed to them. Quantification can only take agencies so far, especially when, as is the case with too-big-to-fail designations, the goal is to protect against unlikely, but potentially calamitous, bank failures. I hope the government wins MetLifeâs appeal, and predict that it will. But the debate about whether regulation is better through math or some other means is likely to continue. Advertisement
