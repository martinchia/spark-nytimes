Days after she was fired as Yahoo‘s chief executive, Carol A. Bartz resigned her seat on the Internet company’s board, according to a spokesman for the directors. The spokesman, Charles Sipkins, said in a statement: “On Sept. 9, 2011, Carol Bartz resigned from the board of directors of Yahoo! Inc. effective immediately.” Yahoo’s board decided to fire her as the company, which has been eclipsed in the Internet space on a variety of fronts, continued to struggle under her leadership to find a new direction.  Ms. Bartz’s departure from the board came after a blunt interview she gave to Fortune on Thursday, the day after she was fired, in which she used profanity and called Yahoo’s directors “doofuses.” In that interview, she asserted that she remained a Yahoo director and planned to hold onto that position. A spokesman for the company’s board said later that day: “Ms. Bartz is obligated to resign from the board and we expect her to do so.” A day later, she did just that. Ms. Bartz’s quick firing, delivered by phone as she was traveling to New York from Maine, was highly unusual. People briefed on the matter have said that Yahoo’s board was dissatisfied with the company’s seeming inability to improve in the nearly two years she ran Yahoo. The company is in the midst of trying to figure out its next steps. It has hired  at least two investment banks, Allen & Company and UBS, to help evaluate strategic alternatives for the company.  Those could range from divestitures of Yahoo’s Asian investments, which some analysts have said are worth more than the company’s actual operations, all the way to a sale of the entire company. While some people close to Yahoo’s board have ruled out a sale of the company, others have said the directors are evaluating all possibilities. Advertisement
