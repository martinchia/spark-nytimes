LONDON — Deutsche Telekom of Germany still faces long-term problems with its American subsidiary, T-Mobile USA, after the proposed $39 billion takeover by AT&T was scrapped on Monday. Deutsche Telekomâs chief executive, RenÃ© Obermann, said on Tuesday that T-Mobile, the fourth-largest mobile phone carrier in the United States, needed additional investment. But the failure of the deal with AT&T gives the company some breathing room in the short term. Under the terms of the deal announced in March, AT&T will pay a break-up fee to Deutsche Telekom that includes $3 billion in cash and wireless spectrum.  “With the spectrum we’re getting, we have a better chance of expanding the network in many markets,â Mr. Obermann said during a conference call with reporters. âThat is not a final solution. In the long term, we need more spectrum and network capacity. We are working on that.â  Mr. Obermann declined to give specifics on the next steps for its American business. T-Mobile needs to make large investments in its mobile phone infrastructure to keep up with consumersâ growing use of data packages on their smartphones. Deutsche Telekom now plans to review its options, but has not set a deadline for deciding the future of T-Mobile USA, said a company spokesman, Andreas Fuchs. âThereâs no Plan B,â Mr. Fuchs said. âWeâre back at the starting point.â Advertisement
