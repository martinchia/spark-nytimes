6:43 p.m. | Updated  So much for the $5 billion man. Investors with John A. Paulson, the hedge fund manager who has mined outsize returns thanks to gold, have seen the value of a chunk of his portfolio decline, thanks to a drop in the precious metalâs price in January, according to monthly returns. The hedge fund manager doubled down on the precious metal in recent years, believing that the dollar would lose value in the coming years. He not only created a gold fund, which invests in gold-exposed investments like mining companies in an effort to outperform the commodity, but he created a class of shares in all of his other funds denominated in the precious metal. But just as gold amplified his greatest gains last year, it has worsened losses in funds with otherwise steady performance this month, thanks to the drop in gold prices. After reaching a nominal record of $1,420 a troy ounce in December, gold prices fell nearly 6 percent in January. A spokesman for Mr. Paulson declined to comment. His gold fund, which manages about $1 billion, was down 12 percent last month. And his gold-denominated funds were all down for the month as well, a sharp â albeit early â setback for a man who personally netted about $5 billion in profits last year after huge gains for funds denominated in gold, which is where the bulk of his personal money is invested. Last year, the bet turned out well for Mr. Paulson, who oversees about $36 billion in assets. The Paulson Advantage fund, his largest, was up 11.1 percent last year, but the gold-class shares of that portfolio surged 30.8 percent. Amid the unrest in Egypt, gold prices have recovered slightly so far in February, and Mr. Paulsonâs funds could rebound. On Friday, gold for April delivery settled at $1,349 an ounce, down $4 on the day. Mr. Paulson is known for betting big. His payday for 2010 exceeded the $4 billion he made for 2007. He became one of the most celebrated hedge fund managers in the business after his firm bet against subprime mortgage investments ahead of the financial crisis. By almost any standard, his wager on gold is quite a bet. His firm, Paulson & Company, owns securities that represent the rough equivalent of 96 metric tons of the metal. If his firm actually owned all that gold, it would be sitting atop more of it than the Australian government. Mr. Paulson himself would be holding more gold than Bulgaria. His gold exposure is achieved through a gold exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Shares, which has attracted a wide array of prominent investors, including George Soros. While investors in the special gold-class shares do not pay an additional management fee for their stake in the gold funds, they pay Mr. Paulson 20 percent of any profits. Only about one-third of his total investors have chosen the gold-class shares, while many instead invest directly in the gold fund and keep all of their gains. Here are returns for Mr. Paulson’s funds, broken down by regular and then the gold-share class: Advantage: Up 0.24 percent; down 5.2 percent. Advantage Plus: Up 0.4 percent; down 4.5 percent. Recovery: Up 0.89 percent; down 3.2 percent. Paulson Partners: Up 2.34 percent; down 2.65 percent. Partners Enhanced: Up 4.35 percent; down 0.14 percent. Paulson Credit: Up 4.35 percent;  down 0.25 percent. Advertisement
