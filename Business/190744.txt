When the dust has settled on investigations into the role of banks in the mortgage crisis, fines could total nearly $50 billion, and that does not include the $13 billion that JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Peter Eavis report in DealBook. Put into context, the $50 billion would equal roughly half the total annual profit of large American banks in 2012. JPMorganâs record mortgage settlement in November has caused trepidation for many Wall Street banks as they and their lawyers try to calculate how much they could owe the government for their role in selling troubled mortgages leading up to the financial crisis.  Ms. Silver-Greenberg and Mr. Eavis write: âThe legal barrage has been generating mounting frustration among some top executives. The bankers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, say the government has taken an arbitrary, one-size-fits-all approach that could force them to pay more than their fair share.â âWhile the potential settlements could be painful for banks, they also would enable them to close a troubled chapter,â they write.  INSIDER TRADING TRIAL RUNDOWN  |  Lawyers for Mathew Martoma, a former SAC Capital Advisors hedge fund manager charged with insider trading, tried to keep evidence that Mr. Martoma had been expelled from Harvard Law School under wraps. But on Thursday, the secret got out after the judge presiding over the trial ordered relevant court papers unsealed, Matthew Goldstein and Alexandra Stevenson report in DealBook. Mr. Martoma was expelled from the prestigious institution in 1999 for creating a false transcript of his grades when he was applying for a clerkship with a federal judge. The disclosure of the information coincided with the selection of a 12-member jury, a difficult process that took three days. The jury consists of seven women and five men, including a chief executive for a shoe and accessory company, a bus operator, an insurance underwriter, an employee of an accounting firm and a labor lawyer. Opening statements are set to begin today.   LAWYERS AS BUSINESSMEN  |  For more than 50 years, the Washington law firm Patton Boggs has been a major force in legal, lobbying and business circles. But even the storied law firm is being forced to adapt to a changing industry that is increasingly requiring firms to act like business strategists, Elizabeth Olson writes in DealBook.   Like many of its peers, the Washington-based firm, which has represented corporations like the Mars candy company and Exxon Mobil, is âseeking a rapid way to bolster its revenue and expand its practice areas through a merger,â Ms. Olson writes. But even âcasting about for a merger partner can open up a firm to speculation in the current ravenously competitive landscape.â  

CHRIS CHRISTIEâS âINNER JAMIE DIMONâ  |  âJamie Dimonâs tale of woe is proving an uncanny inspirationâ to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Jeffrey Goldfarb of Reuters Breakingviews writes.  âThe two men share a no-nonsense leadership style, but perhaps also a blind spot to the repercussions their behaviors foster further down the organizations they run.â



ON THE AGENDA  |  The jobs report for December comes out at 8:30 a.m. Two regional Federal Reserve presidents are scheduled to give separate speeches on the economy â Jeffrey Lacker, the president of the Richmond Fed, goes on in Raliegh, N.C., at 8:45 a.m and James Bullard takes the stage in Indianapolis at 1:05 p.m. William H. Gross, the co-founder of Pimco, is on CNBC at 2 p.m. Looking ahead: NBC hosts the Golden Globes on Sunday at 8 p.m. 



SNAPCHAT SAYS SORRY  |  Snapchat finally apologized on Thursday for a security vulnerability that allowed a group of security researchers to expose the names and phone numbers of 4.6 million Snapchat users on Jan. 1. âWe are sorry for any problems this issue may have caused you and we really appreciate your patience and support,â Snapchat wrote in a blog post.
