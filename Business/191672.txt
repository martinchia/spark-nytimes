 BT is in a strong position for mobile mergers and acquisitions. It has shaken up British communications by moving into television and by preparing to start a novel mobile service of its own. Now the fixed-line giant finds itself with a choice of two wireless networks to buy, TelefÃ³nica’s O2 unit or Orange and Deutsche Telekomâs EE. There are few likely counter-bidders for either potential target. By European standards, Britain is late to âquad-playâ packages that combine landline, broadband, mobile and television. But BT, which shed its mobile network in 2001, is changing this. It has funds – 2.6 billion-plus pounds of free cash flow this year and wants new growth. It also needs to fight back in broadband where Sky has become a powerful rival. So BT is readying a mobile service of its own, which will initially use EEâs network and eventually make use of BTâs Wi-Fi hot spots and in-home kit. Finishing this technologically tricky, âinside-outâ network will take time but its emergence has already put pressure on the mobile-focused O2 and EE. O2 may fetch somewhere between 6.5 and 7.8 times 2014 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Â Â£9 billion to Â Â£10.8 billion pounds. The larger EE would cost more: Ebitda was roughly one-eighth higher than TelefÃ³nica’s British unit Â in 2013. Profit margins are pretty low in British mobile, and Citigroup reckons that BT might struggle to increase earnings unless it can generate sizable synergies. Structure will matter, too. An all-equity deal wouldnât help TelefÃ³nica de-lever, unless it loaded debt on O2 first. Still, it helps BT that there are two potential targets and few other bidders. It would be a bold move for Liberty Global or Sky, fresh from buying sister businesses in Europe. Vodafone is probably ruled out on antitrust grounds and a move by Hutchison Whampoa, owner of the smallest network 3, looks improbable. Other deals might follow. Fixed-line provider TalkTalk might be put together with whichever network goes unsold. Alternatively TalkTalk might go to Vodafone. Or the latter could bid for Liberty, to create a huge integrated player in Britain, Germany and the Netherlands. The merger game in quad-play is far from over.
