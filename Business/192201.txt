In a smart column today, Bruce Bartlett looks at why it will be so hard for politicians to cut government spending: because so many Americans who say they support cutting government programs don’t realize just how much they benefit from them. Remember, for example, when a town hall attendee famously told his congressman to “keep your government hands off my Medicareâ? Apparently that bewilderingly blinkered sentiment is hardly unique. Mr. Bartlett produces the following chart, from a recent paper by the Cornell political scientist Suzanne Mettler, showing how many recipients of government benefits somehow donât believe they’veÂ  received any benefits:  Government Social   Programâ Pretty amazing, right? As Mr. Bartlett notes, this kind of willful ignorance — and the political momentum for government spending cuts that it enables — can’t last forever: No doubt, many of these people will very quickly find out who they are  as soon as lobbyists start fighting the proposed cuts.  Advertising, news stories, congressional testimony, and analyses from  trade associations and think tanks will all be mobilized to identify,  precisely, who will lose from the Republican meat ax and to make their  views known. We could soon have a reverse Tea Party of laid off  government workers, farmers and who knows how many other people irate at  losing government benefits or government services such as post offices  that will probably have to be closed.
