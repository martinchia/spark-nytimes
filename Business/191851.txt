Baseball fans of a certain age — i.e., mine — will remember Douglas V. DeCinces, a standout third baseman for the Baltimore Orioles and California Angels.  On Thursday, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Mr. DeCinces and three others of insider trading ahead of a merger announcement. According to a complaint filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Mr. DeCinces and his associates made more than $1.7 million in illegal profit on Abbott Laboratories’s $2.8 billion acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics in 2009. Mr. DeCinces and the three others settled the S.E.C.’s civil charges, with Mr. DeCinces agreeing to pay $2.5 million to resolve his role in the case. His lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. âTime and again, we see reputable people engaging in insider trading and risking their good names in order to enrich themselves and those around them,â said Daniel M. Hawke, chief of the S.E.C.’s division of enforcement’s market-abuse unit and head of its Philadelphia office, which brought the case. âPeople need to understand that we are watching for suspicious trading activity, and they will pay a heavy price when we catch them insider trading.â The S.E.C. said that Mr. DeCinces, who lives in Laguna Beach, Calif., received a tip about the deal from an unnamed source inside Advanced Medical Optics, which is based in Santa Ana, Calif. Mr. DeCinces began purchasing shares in Advanced Medical Optics and continued to buy them as he received updated information on the merger, the S.E.C. said. He also tipped off three associates who also bought stock — his physical therapist, a real estate lawyer and a local businessman.  When the companies announced the merger on Jan. 12, 2009, Advanced Medical Optics stock rose 143 percent and Mr. DeCinces sold all of his shares for $1.2 million in profit. Mr. DeCinces appears to have built a successful post-baseball life. According to this 2008 profile on MLB.com, Mr. DeCinces owns a real estate development firm in Irvine, Calif., and runs eight restaurants in Southern California.  Advertisement
