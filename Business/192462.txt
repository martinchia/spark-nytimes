AT JPMORGAN, A PROGRAM TO HIRE CHINAâS ELITE  |  JPMorgan Chase started a program in 2006 called âSons and Daughters,â as friends and family of Chinaâs ruling elite were clamoring for jobs at the bank, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Ben Protess report in DealBook. Although it was originally supposed to protect the bankâs business dealings in China, it went so off track that it is now the focus of a federal bribery investigation in the United States, according to interviews and a confidential government document. âSaying they wanted to weed out nepotism and avoid bribery charges in the United States, JPMorgan employees in Asia started the program to hire well-connected candidates on a separate track from ordinary applicants, the employees and executives said. Without the program and its heightened scrutiny of the candidates, the employees argued, JPMorgan might improperly hire the children of Chinese officials to win business,â DealBook writes. âBut in the months and years that followed, the two-tiered process that could have prevented questionable hiring practices instead fostered them, according to the interviews as well as the confidential government document. Applicants from prominent Chinese families, interviews show, often faced few job interviews and relaxed standards. While many candidates met or exceeded the bankâs requirements, some had subpar academic records and lacked relevant expertise.â JPMorgan declined to comment and has not been accused of wrongdoing. No one has indicated that the children of Chinese officials helped the bank win business deals, and public documents do not offer a concrete link between the bankâs hiring practices and its ability to secure deals. 

NASDAQ SHUTDOWN IS TRACED TO SOFTWARE  |  The Nasdaq market, which calls itself a home for the stocks of the worldâs biggest technology companies, acknowledged on Thursday that a three-hour halt in trading arose from a problem with its software, DealBookâs Michael J. de la Merced reports. The exchangeâs parent company released preliminary findings that provided the clearest official insight into what caused the trading halt.
âA series of attempts by a market operated by the NYSE Euronext to connect with the Nasdaq system that reports the prices of recent trades generated a surge of data. That led to a failure of Nasdaqâs backup systems, forcing the market to go offline to fix the problem,â Mr. de la Merced writes.
On Thursday, Nasdaq said that it was âdeeply disappointedâ in its performance on Aug. 22 and called it âunacceptable to our members, issuers and the investing public.â




ZURICH INSURANCE TO INVESTIGATE EXECUTIVEâS SUICIDE  |  âZurich Insurance said Friday that its board of directors would look into whether undue pressure was put on the companyâs chief financial officer before he died in an apparent suicide, an event that led to the resignation of the Zurich chairman, Josef Ackermann, and shook Switzerlandâs tidy financial capital,â Jack Ewing reports in The New York Times.
Top managers of Zurich Insurance sought to reassure skeptical stock analysts that the apparent suicide on Monday of Pierre Wauthier, a 53-year-old father of two, did not signal deeper problems at the company, Switzerlandâs third-largest insurer. Still, it was clear that the death of Mr. Wauthier had shaken confidence in Zurich Insuranceâs financial performance.
