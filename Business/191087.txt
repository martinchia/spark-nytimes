Stephen R. Hertz, a top lawyer in mergers and acquisitions as well as private equity buyouts, died on Friday in Manhattan. He was 55. In an apparent suicide, Mr. Hertz jumped from his Upper West Side apartment, a police department spokeswoman said.  Mr. Hertz, as a partner at the prominent white-shoe law firm Debevoise & Plimpton, advised clients including Landstar System, a transportation services provider, and Cambrex, a life sciences company, on a range of corporate matters. He also represented private equity firms including Stone Point Capital and HarbourVest Partners. He wrote on trends in the private equity world, with his byline appearing frequently in Debevoiseâs private equity newsletter. In an article written last year with a number of colleagues, Mr. Hertz addressed the examinations of private equity firms being conducted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. He also may have helped Debevoise gain a measure of cultural stardom. According to abovethelaw.com, Mr. Hertz was a friend of Aaron Sorkin, the creator of the TV show âThe West Wing,â which occasionally featured the law firm. “We are shocked and deeply saddened by the passing of our partner and friend Steve Hertz,â a Debevoise spokesman said in a statement. “Steve was an exceptionally warm and caring person, extraordinarily dedicated to our clients, and generous to his colleagues. He will be profoundly missed.â Stephen Richard Hertz was born on April 18, 1959, in Manhattan. He received his bachelorâs degree from Middlebury College in 1982 and his law degree from the University of Chicago in 1985, joining Debevoise that year. He became a partner of the firm in 2000. Mr. Hertz is survived by his wife, Debra Condren, a psychologist and author, and a son from a previous marriage, Jake.  Advertisement
