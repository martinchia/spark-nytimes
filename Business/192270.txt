The First Data Corporation, a payment processing company owned by the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, said on Thursday that it would raise $3.5 billion in a private sale of its stock. The infusion of capital comes as First Data tries to improve its finances after experiencing repeated losses under a mountain of debt. The company was bought by K.K.R. for $29 billion in 2007, in one of the largest leveraged buyouts in history. The timing of the deal presented immediate challenges, as the financial crisis strained First Data’s business. The company has laid off thousands of workers and sought to refinance its debt. Last year, it hired Frank Bisignano, a top executive at JPMorgan Chase, to be its chief executive. The company, which processes credit card payments and manages A.T.M.’s, says it is shifting its strategy to include additional services for businesses. The new stock sale will help the company reduce some of its debt, which stood at about $22.5 billion on March 31. The sale was led by K.K.R., which committed to providing $1.2 billion, including $500 from one of its funds and $700 million from the balance sheet of the private equity firm itself. In total, current investors in First Data provided $1.5 billion, while new investors provided $2 billion, the company said. âOur biggest investment that we had to date in any company was First Data,â Henry R. Kravis, a co-founder of K.K.R., said in an interview. âThat investment just got significantly bigger.â Mr. Kravis said the stock sale would reduce the companyâs ratio of debt to equity to two times from four times. By reducing its debt, the company expects annual savings of $375 million in interest payments. âThis has been a year of transformation for this company,â Mr. Bisignano said in an interview. The stock sale, he said, “is a validation of this transformation and strategy.” The sale is expected to close around July 11. It was handled by K.K.R.’s capital markets arm.
