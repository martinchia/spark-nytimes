SoftBank and Dish Network have pulled out the stops in their $20 billion-plus battle to control Sprint Nextel. But SoftBank has the edge. Dishâs claim that Japanese ownership of the American cellphone operator is a risk to national security is half-baked and shows boss Charlie Ergenâs desperation. For sure, telecommunications infrastructure can be a matter of national security â all the more so when it carries traffic for the Pentagon and the raft of secretive agencies known by three-letter abbreviations, as Sprint does. Yet while the Chinese might present obvious questions, itâs a much less plausible claim that Japanese ownership of American assets is risky. The countries have been close allies for approaching seven decades. As part of its $20 billion bid for 70 percent of Sprint, SoftBank has also promised to appoint a director to Sprintâs board â someone vetted by the United States government â who will ensure sensitive data is kept out of reach of the Japanese owners.  This sort of arrangement has worked in the past to alleviate any residual concerns. When Singaporeâs ST Telemedia acquired a majority stake in Global Crossing a decade ago, it signed an agreement with the federal government under which four board members received United States government approval and served as the security committee. Whatâs more, SoftBank has promised to rip out networking equipment used by Sprintâs network partner Clearwire and produced by Huawei, a Chinese manufacturer embodying Congressâs cybersecurity concerns. Last year, the House Intelligence Committee said telecom companies should avoid using the firmâs equipment because of its close ties to the Chinese government. SoftBank estimates the cost of replacement would be $1 billion. Dish hasnât yet made a similar promise alongside its $26 billion offer for all of Sprint, which suggests its complaint isnât really about national security, but rather about having the weaker position in an M.&A. fight. Lawmakers and investors alike can afford to ignore the diversion. Robert Cyran is a columnist for Reuters Breakingviews. For more independent commentary and analysis, visit breakingviews.com.
