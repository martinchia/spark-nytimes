LONDON â The Russian steel maker Severstal said on Monday that it had agreed to sell two steel facilities in the United States to two of its American rivals, Steel Dynamics and AK Steel, for more than $2.3 billion. Severstal invested heavily in the two locations in an international expansion drive before the financial crisis and is now trying to cut costs in an effort to stem losses. The company said it would sell a facility in northeast Mississippi called Severstal Columbus to Steel Dynamics for about $1.6 billion. Severstal will sell another large plant in Dearborn, Mich., to AK Steel for $700 million. The move comes as tightening sanctions by the United States on Russia in response to the crisis in Ukraine are creating concerns about whether Russian companies will be able to continue to access loans and other financial tools in the West. The sales, however, are likely to have been prompted more by Severstalâs own struggling business. For the first quarter of this year, Severstal reported a $100 million loss on revenue of about $3 billion. The company said it had been trying to sell the American plants since late last year. “The sale of Columbus and Dearborn unlocks substantial value to Severstalâs shareholders,ââ Alexey Mordashov, Severstalâs chief executive, said in a statement. Jeff Largey, a steel analyst at Macquarie Securities in London, said the deals should benefit American steel makers by giving them more pricing power. “I think this is a positive development for the U.S. steel industry,ââ he said in an email on Monday. “It leads to further consolidation of the market by U.S. producers.ââ The American companies are taking advantage of what they believe are opportunities to snap up quality assets at a good price. Steel Dynamics, which is based in Fort Wayne, Ind., said in a statement that it was gaining “one of the newest and most technologically advanced mini-mills in North America.ââ Steel Dynamics said the purchase would add about 40 percent to its annual steel shipping capacity.  AK Steel, which is based in West Chester, Ohio, said the Dearborn facility would increase its efforts in flat steel sheets for the auto and appliance markets, which have seen strong demand in North America. Other foreign producers have also run into difficulty in North America. After huge losses on facilities in the United States and Brazil, last year the German steel maker Thyssen Krupp sold the steel finishing mill it had built in Calvert, Ala., to a joint venture of ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal for $1.55 billion, substantially less than it cost to build the plant.
