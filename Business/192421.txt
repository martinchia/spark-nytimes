The mortgage orgy that banks entered into before the financial crisis has caused them â and their borrowers â immense pain since then. I have lost track of all the settlements and payments. Now The American Banker newspaper is reporting that banks may be hiding losses from their shareholders: The nation’s four largest banks are holding $57 billion of seriously delinquent loans that they’ve been slow to move into foreclosure over concerns that the Federal Housing Administration, the government mortgage insurer, will refuse to cover the losses and hit them with damages, according to industry sources. The banks â Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (NYSE: C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) â have assured investors in the footnotes of quarterly filings that the loans are government-insured and therefore pose no threat to their bottom lines, even if they end up in foreclosure. What’s more, the banks have used these supposedly ironclad government guarantees as a pretext for continuing to classify the loans as performing and for holding no reserves against them. Normally, an F.H.A. guarantee can be taken as meaning that the lender will be repaid. (We are going to ignore the possibility that the F.H.A. could be unable to meet its obligations.)  But as the article points out: The FHA’s guarantee does not apply if lenders are found to have violated underwriting or servicing standards, or to have engaged in misconduct. Banks can also be held liable for treble damages under the False Claims Act if they are found to have “falsely certified” that mortgages met all FHA requirements.  Rebel Cole, a former Federal Reserve Board economist who is now a professor of finance and real estate at DePaul University in Chicago, says the banks could face heavy losses on the loans because the F.H.A. might refuse to cover them. The article adds: Some lenders acknowledge that they will likely end up eating losses on defaulted loans held on their balance sheets and settlements related to past claims. They are also likely to try to avoid the risk of getting hit with damages by forgoing the FHA claims process and absorbing some losses themselves. There are other possible reasons for delays in the banks’ foreclosing on loans and filing claims with the F.H.A. But if banks have made the decision not to file claims, they should be taking losses. That is an issue for bank auditors to address. Floyd Norris, the chief financial correspondent of The New York Times, covers the world of finance and  economics.
