LONDON â The board of the owner of the Canary Wharf office-and-retail development said on Monday that shareholders should reject a hostile bid for the company made by Qatarâs sovereign wealth fund and Brookfield Property Partners. Last month, the Qatar Investment Authority and Brookfield made a final offer for Songbird Estates, which has a controlling stake in the Canary Wharf Group. The all-cash bid for all of Songbirdâs outstanding shares valued the company at 2.6 billion pounds, or about $3.9 billion. On Monday, Songbirdâs board members, other than those appointed by the Qatar fund, recommended that investors reject the approach, saying that it did not reflect âthe full value of the business, its unique operating platform and its prospects.â âThe offer gives no value for Canary Wharf Group’s potential to earn development profits or for the growth potential of the existing estate and fails to take into account the value for its control of the estate,â David Pritchard, the Songbird independent chairman, said in a statement. The Qatar fund and Brookfield first approached Songbird about a potential takeover in November and revised their bid in December, offering to pay Â£3.50 a share for the company. On Monday, the Songbird directors said the Qatar-Brookfield bid was âat a significant discountâ to Songbirdâs pro forma adjusted net asset value, which they say is Â£3.81 a share. Shares of Songbird closed up slightly, to Â£3.22, in London on Monday. The Qatar Investment Authority and Brookfield already hold significant stakes in the Canary Wharf Group, the operator of the complex, or its parent, Songbird. Songbird acquired a controlling stake in the Canary Wharf Group in 2004 and delisted its shares. It holds a 69.37 percent stake in the company, while Brookfield has a 22.08 percent interest in the Canary Wharf Group.Â The Qatari fund owns a 28.6 percent stake in Songbird. Several Songbird shareholders, including Third Avenue Management and Madison International Holdings, have pledged support for the hostile offer. The deal, if consummated, would be another prominent addition to the Qatar Investment Authorityâs real estate portfolio in London. The sovereign wealth fund owns the Shard, Britainâs tallest skyscraper; the luxury department store Harrods, and the former Olympic Village in East London. The Canary Wharf development, built in a district once known for its docks, has 34 office buildings and nearly 700,000 square feet of retail space. It is the London home to some of the worldâs biggest banks, including Barclays, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. More than 100,000 people work at Canary Wharf. Advertisement
