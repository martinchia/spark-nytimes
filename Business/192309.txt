As it gets ready to go public in what could be the biggest stock market debut ever in the United States, the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group will begin a roadshow for potential investors on Monday, Michael J. de la Merced writes in DealBook. The tour, which will begin in New York, will encompass 100 meetings in 10 days. Two teams of senior executives, code-named red and orange, will travel with advisers across the United States and then to Europe, the Middle East and Asia. At the midpoint of its expected price range of $60 to $66 in American depositary shares, Alibaba would be valued at nearly $156 billion, not far behind Amazon.com and more than eBay, LinkedIn and Twitter combined. At $66 a share, the company would be trading at around 40 times its earnings for the 12 months through the end of March. The stock sale is expected to generate a bonanza for the small group of investors who are selling shares, including Yahoo, which would reap some $7.7 billion at the midpoint of the price range. If all goes according to plan, executives will return to New York by Sept. 18 for the pricing of the shares. Alibaba would begin trading the next day on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BABA. When Alibaba does go public, âinvestors will have little doubt about who is in control of the company,â David Barboza writes in The New York Times. Jack Ma, 49, âis the public face. He is the chief negotiator. He is the top strategist. He is the biggest individual investor, with a 9 percent stake.â Mr. Barboza adds, âAlibaba, a company started out of Mr. Maâs apartment in 1999, is now a technology colossus worth more than American stalwarts like eBay and Hewlett-Packard. Under his leadership, Alibaba has become not just the dominant force in Chinaâs e-commerce but also a symbol of the countryâs breathtaking economic rise.â  ELECTROLUX TO BUY G.E. APPLIANCE UNIT  |  General Electric said on Monday that it had agreed to sell its appliance business for $3.3 billion in cash to Electrolux of Sweden, parting ways with its century-old division that introduced the washer-dryer and the toaster oven, DealBookâs Chad Bray writes. As part of the deal, Electrolux will continue to use the G.E. Appliances brand name. The acquisition is expected to significantly bolster Electroluxâs growing business in North America. G.E. first tried to sell the unit six years ago, but talks fell apart in the onset of the financial crisis. Electrolux, one of the worldâs biggest manufacturers of home appliances and industrial equipment, posted sales of 109 billion Swedish kronor, or about $15.3 billion, last year. G.E.âs appliance division generated $5.7 billion in revenue in the same period. The combined Electrolux-G.E. Appliances would have about 73,000 employees worldwide. The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in 2015. The transaction carries a $175 million termination fee if Electrolux is unable to win regulatory approval.  GOLDMANâS AMBIGUOUS BYLAWS  |  Corporate bylaws of big banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, definitively state which employees will have legal fees covered, but Goldman Sachsâs bylaws are ambiguous on the matter of one group of people, its so-called officers, whose legal bills it is supposed to cover, Gretchen Morgenson writes in the Fair Game column. This has the effect of letting the firm decide whose bills among this group it will pay and whose it wonât. Goldmanâs unusual stance on employeesâ legal fees first came to light during the legal odyssey of Sergey Aleynikov, a former computer programmer and Goldman vice president who was charged with stealing some of the firmâs computer code in 2009. âThese ambiguous bylaws set up an intriguing dynamic among Goldman employees,â Ms. Morgenson writes. âPut simply, being able to choose which of its officers will receive advance payments for legal bills gives the firm significant leverage over those who become ensnared in an investigation or lawsuit. Indeed, the flexible nature of Goldmanâs policy could easily discourage those involved in such proceedings from implicating superiors who may have been involved in wrongdoing. Who would take such a chance, knowing that Goldman could cut off the legal fee spigot at any time?â  ON THE AGENDA  |  Data on consumer credit is out at 3 p.m. Treasury Secretary Jacob J.

DOLLAR GENERALâS NEXT MOVE  |  Family Dollar said on Friday that it had formally rejected a revised $9.1 billion offer from Dollar General, arguing that new measures meant to provide assurances about antitrust risk were insufficient, DealBookâs Michael J. de la Merced writes. Family Dollar will instead stick with its existing $8.5 billion merger with Dollar Tree. The two companies disclosed that they had reinforced their agreement with a pledge by Dollar Tree to sell as many stores as necessary to ensure that the deal passes regulatory muster. With the rejection, Family Dollar is also setting up an argument that Dollar General can never satisfy the Family Dollar board, Steven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor column. But that may not be the case. âIâd expect Dollar General to take a half measure in the continuing dollar wars â perhaps offering up even more divestitures and if (as is likely) it doesnât convince the Family Dollar board, taking that proposal to shareholders,â Mr. Solomon writes.    |  Contact: @melbournecoal | E-mail  Sign up for the DealBook Newsletter, delivered every morning and afternoon.   FMC to Acquire Danish Insecticide Maker for $1.4 Billion  |  The deal to acquire Cheminova is expected to bolster FMC, a Philadelphia-based company that supplies insecticides, fungicides and other chemicals to the agriculture industry.
