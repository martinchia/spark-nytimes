Barbara J. Desoer, who as head of Bank of Americaâs home loans division served as a point person for the bank amid fierce criticism of its foreclosure practices, is retiring.  Until last September, Ms. Desoer reported directly to Brian Moynihan, Bank of Americaâs chief executive. But after a corporate reorganization, Ms. Desoerâs unit was placed under David Darnell, who oversees consumer banking as co-chief operating officer of Bank of America. With that restructuring now finalized, Bank of America said it is not appointing a replacement for Ms. Desoer.  As the nationâs largest mortgage servicer, Bank of America has been sharply criticized amid a broader investigation by state attorneys general and federal regulators into abuses such as “robo signing,” where foreclosure applications were approved after only cursory examinations.  A broad settlement between Bank of America and other major servicers like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup that could be worth as much as $25 billion is expected to be announced next week. Ms. Desoer said her decision to leave, which takes effect this month, was unrelated to that deal.  âIâve been with the company 34 years and Iâm retiring,â she said in an interview. âMy timing is related to what I committed to in helping Brian and David with the transition of home loans into consumer banking, and itâs that context.â  She added that she had not decided on whatâs next. âIâve been very intensely focused,â she said. âNow Iâm going to take some time and think about what Iâm going to do.â  Advertisement
