The Dodd-Frank Act cracked down on the credit rating agencies, the firms that awarded rosy ratings to bonds backed by junky mortgages, but some lawmakers and consumer advocates contend that the regulatory overhaul falls short.  A spate of new Dodd-Frank rules for the rating agencies âdoesnât really respond to the conflict of interest thatâs inherent in the system,â Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, said Thursday. Critics like Mr. Franken argue that the rating agenciesâ business model is innately compromised. Banks and corporations that issue debt pay the rating agencies to assign their bonds a letter grade. In the lead up to the financial crisis, the critics say, the rating agencies sacrificed the integrity of their ratings to increase their bottom lines.  At the time, the rating agencies blessed many subprime mortgage bonds with the highly coveted triple-A rating. When the investments soured, it set off a chain reaction that nearly toppled the economy.  When Congress was debating Dodd-Frank, some lawmakers floated the idea of scrapping the so-called issuer-pays model altogether. Mr. Franken proposed creating an independent body, perhaps a public utility or self-regulatory organization, that would randomly assign ratings to different agencies. âThis is not a progressive or conservative idea — itâs a common-sense idea,â Mr. Franken said on a conference call with reporters, hosted by Americans for Financial Reform, a consumer advocacy group. âInstead of pay-to-play, weâd switch to pay-for-performance.â But during the final days of negotiations over Dodd-Frank, amid fierce lobbying by the rating agencies, lawmakers abandoned the plan. Instead, they reached a compromise, requiring the Securities and Exchange Commission to study the feasibility of using an independent body to assign ratings.  Mr. Franken vowed to âhold the S.E.C.âs feet to the fireâ when the study is released.  The S.E.C., meanwhile, has proposed several new rules to tighten its oversight of the rating agencies. Under Dodd-Frank, the S.E.C. has moved to strip references to credit ratings from dozens of regulations, some of them decades old, including rules that govern securities offerings. In May, regulators also unveiled 500 pages of proposed rules that, for instance, would prohibit analysts from issuing ratings if they also separately marketed their rating agencyâs products or services. âThese rules are intended to help investors and other users of credit ratings better understand and assess the ratings,â Mary L. Schapiro, chairwoman of the S.E.C., said at the time.  But Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America, likened the rules to the âChinese restaurant approach to reform,â offering a smattering of options but no comprehensive overhaul.  âThe commission has proposed simply to do,â she said on the conference call, what the rating agencies âalready claim to be doing.â Advertisement
