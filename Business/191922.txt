Itâs one of the toughest jobs in banking.  But Bank of America has found a new executive to run its Legacy Asset Servicing division, home to tens of billions of dollars in soured mortgage assets and home loans that are delinquent or in default. Ron Sturzenegger, who heads Bank of America Merrill Lynchâs real estate, gaming and lodging team, will join the bankâs management team and run the Legacy division, which was formed in February to help the Bank of America put its long-running problems with bad mortgages behind it by separating out the troubled home loans.  âRon is a proven leader who brings deep credibility and expertise in real estate to the Legacy Asset Servicing team, and I welcome him to the management team,â said Brian T. Moynihan, Bank of Americaâs chief executive.  âRon benefits from the great momentum the Legacy Asset Servicing team has created in the past year, and I am confident he and the team will build on that as we put these issues behind us.â Bank of America picked up much of the portfolio  in 2008 when it acquired Countrywide Financial, the subprime lender whose excesses have come to epitomize the housing boom that collapsed and helped trigger the financial crisis of 2008.  The previous head of the unit, Terry Laughlin, will assume the position of chief risk officer for Bank of America, a move that was announced last month. The huge overhang of bad mortgage debt has been weighing down shares of Bank of America for months, despite deals like an $8.5 billion agreement in June with private investors to resolve claims related to bad loans underwritten by Countrywide. Investors fear the bank could still have to pay tens of billions of dollars more. Bank of America shares were trading at just over $7 at midday Thursday, down more than 50 percent from where they started 2011.        Advertisement
