Are you getting the most out of your business? When business owners incorporate, they typically do so for one of two reasons: Their accountant told them itâs a good idea, or they want to be taxed in a particular manner. Now there’s a third reason to consider. They might want to join the thousands of companies that have decided to become âbenefit corporations.â These companies want the tax benefits and legal protections of incorporating, but they also want to hold themselves to a higher standard on nonfinancial issues. The concept of benefit corporations was popularized by B Lab, a nonprofit created in 2006 by two entrepreneurs and an investor. One of the entrepreneurs, Jay Coen Gilbert, co-founded the sports shoe company AND1. He focused on a âtriple bottom lineâ approach: profit, people and planet. Charitable activities and sustainability were a core part of the companyâs mission. After AND1 was acquired in 2005, Mr. Coen Gilbert watched with frustration as the new owners dismantled most of the programs he had put in place. He understood that many business owners had nonfinancial goals for their companies and hoped to find a way to protect them legally. B Lab was the outgrowth of that thinking.  The movement B Lab started quickly gained supporters. In 2010, Maryland became the first state to recognize benefit corporations formally. Now, 24 states have such laws on the books, and at least 10 more are considering it. Each state has its own rules, but in general, registering as a benefit corporation lets a company enshrineÂ certain goals in its founding documents, like donating a set percentage of profits to charity or working only with environmentally responsible suppliers. B Lab is a voluntary certification body. Its âCertified B Corp.â mark isnât required for those that want to become a benefit corporation, but it aims to be like the âFair Tradeâ label for coffee: a sign that the company is committed to meeting standards that go beyond financial benchmarks. B Corps must be transparent. They have to share information and decision-making with their employees.Â They must have environmental policies that take into account their pollution footprint. They must complete a company assessment and pay a certification fee. Why would a company want to do this? Steve Voigt, the chief executive. of King Arthur Flour, was one of the first to sign up for B Labâs certification. His employee-owned company has been a triple bottom line firm for years, and he wanted a way to measure its progress and verify it for stakeholders. For Mr. Voigt, B Lab solved a problem: It allowed him to use a scorecard developed by an independent agency to rank his companyâs success at carrying out its values. One of my clients had a different motivation. It wanted to strengthen its ties to Ben & Jerryâs, a certified B Corp. that has been known for being a socially responsible company. Ben & Jerry’s prefers to work with vendors that meet its criteria for designation as a âvalues-led supplier.â My client is a national leader in open-book management and had had high employee satisfaction and environmental results. Still, it needed a way to prove to Ben & Jerryâs that it deserved to be named a values-led supplier. Becoming a B Corp solved the problem. My client was especially happy that B Labâs audit found his company met all of its criteria: He didnât have to make any changes to become certified. Going through B Labâs process can be time consuming. An executive from King Arthur Flour told me that it took staff about 80 hours to put together all the required documentation. For smaller companies, that step should generally be easier and quicker. The certification process starts with a free “impact assessment” survey that can be taken online. I took it and found that my wealth management firm would need to change several operating principles to qualify. My partners didn’t see a huge value in doing so. We decided that a B Corp wasnât right for this company. Iâm also starting a new company, though, where Iâll be the president. I plan to design that companyâs practices in a manner that will allow us to qualify. For me, operating with a triple bottom line approach makes good business sense. Iâm curious about the experiences of other companies. If youâve gone through B Labâs certification or considered it, I would love to hear your comments. Does a triple bottom line approach make your business more attractive to stakeholders?
