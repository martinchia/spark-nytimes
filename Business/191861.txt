Sara Lee and Ralcorp are both food companies that have been busy trying to remake themselves this year. On Tuesday, they reached a deal toward that mutual end.  Sara Lee has agreed to sell its North American private-brand refrigerated dough business to Ralcorp for $545 million.  The sale comes as Sara Lee is preparing to split into two separate food and beverage companies. The sale, said  Marcel Smits, the company’s chief executive, “will better enable our North American business to focus on its branded meats and frozen desserts products and establish a platform for a strong and independent future.â Ralcorp, meanwhile, is spinning off its Post Foods cereal business. The refrigerated dough acquisition will bolster its private brand business, while the proceeds from the Post Foods split will help pay back the short-term debt being used to finance the acquisition.  The company has also been trying to fend off an unsolicited $4.9 billion takeover offer from ConAgra Foods.  Ralcorp said it expected the acquisition would add to earnings by more 30 cents a share in the first year. “Given its higher margins and free cash flow, we expect this acquisition to result in the creation of significant value for Ralcorp shareholders,” Kevin J. Hunt, co-chief executive of Ralcorp, said. The Sara Lee refrigerated dough business had more than  $300 million in revenue last year. It employs about 700 and has manufacturing plants in  Forest Park, Ga., and Carrollton, Tex. Advertisement
