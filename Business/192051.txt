Nachas, Yiddish for joy, was in high supply Wednesday night as more than 1,100 members of New Yorkâs Jewish community gathered to honor two of their own at the UJA-Federationâs annual Wall Street Dinner. âIt just occurred to me: This is the largest number of Jews Iâve spoken to since my bar mitzvah,â said the master of ceremonies, David Moore, the chief executive officer of Moore Holdings.  Mr. Moore, who moonlights as a stand-up comedian, drew groans for a joke about recently being hired to perform at a German bank: âThey paid me with a big chunk of cash and a painting that belonged to my grandfather.â   Mr. Moore then turned the podium over to the eveningâs honorees. Peter W. May, president of Trian Fund Management, and Michael B. Nierenberg, managing director of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Mr. May received an award named for Gustave L. Levy, the legendary senior partner of Goldman Sachs, and Mr. Nierenberg collected the Wall Street Young Leadership Award.   Both honorees commemorated the 20th anniversary of Operation Exodus, a UJA-Federation campaign in which oppressed Jews were airlifted from Eastern Europe and resettled in Israel and North America. âOperation Exodus was an amazing effort that resulted in being able to liberate a million Jews from the former Soviet Union, and tonight is a way for Wall Streetâs Jewish community to show its support,â said Mr. May, who chaired the campaign in 1990.  Mr. Nierenberg, who worked at Lehman Brothers at the time of Operation Exodus, was celebrated for sponsoring with colleagues an airplane that brought Jewish refugees from Kiev to Israel.    The UJA-Federationâs Wall Street Dinner â held this year in a third-floor ballroom at the midtown Hilton â is a perennial draw for the A-listers in finance. Among this yearâs boldface names: hedge-fund titan John A. Paulson, Daniel S. Och of Och-Ziff Capital Management, the corporate investor Nelson Peltz and Alan C. Greenberg, known as Ace, the 83-year-old former chief executive of Bear Stearns and current vice chairman emeritus at JPMorgan Chase.  âIâve been to 60 straight of these, I think, but this oneâs bigger,â said Mr. Greenberg, who headed up fund-raising campaigns for the UJA-Federation from his post atop Bear Stearns. When asked about the prospects for next yearâs event, Mr. Greenberg joked, âIâm just hope Iâm still perpendicular.â  The event raised $19.5 million for the UJA-Federationâs annual campaign, said John S. Ruskay, executive vice president and chief executive of the UJA-Federationâs New York chapter.  âWe judge ourselves not by the dollars raised, but by what we do,â he said.
Mr. Ruskay also noted that despite the eventâs Jewish roots, he suspected there were a few non-Jews in attendance.  âWe donât check their IDs on the way in,â he said. âWhat do they call it? Donât ask, donât tell.â After the speeches, attendees adjourned to an adjacent room for a casino-style party that included blackjack, Texas hold-em, craps and roulette â played, the UJA-Federation carefully noted, âfor bragging rights only.â  As waiters circulated with mini-cupcakes, popcorn chicken and other finger snacks, young financiers threw big bets around with abandon. âI never gamble with my own money,â said one young Goldman Sachs employee, posted across from a roulette wheel. âBut these chips arenât real, so who cares?â Mr. Nierenberg, one of the evening’s designated mensches, left the casino party early, deciding to celebrate his Young Leadership award in a different way. âIâm going to get Chinese food with my family,â he said.
