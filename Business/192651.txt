LONDON â Salix Pharmaceuticals of North Carolina said late Tuesday that it had struck a deal to acquire the Irish arm of an Italian drug maker, becoming the latest United States company to seek to move its headquarters abroad for tax purposes. Under the deal, Salix will merge with Cosmo Technologies, the Irish unit of Cosmo Pharmaceuticals of Italy, in exchange for a stake of more than 20 percent in the combined company.  Salix will reincorporate in Ireland in a process known as an inversion, which will allow it to save millions of dollars in corporate taxes. The combined company will seek to be listed on Nasdaq. âCombining with Cosmo Tech makes tremendous strategic and financial sense for us as it further strengthens and consolidates our position as a leader in acquiring, developing and marketing products to treat gastrointestinal disease and disorders,â Carolyn Logan, Salix’s president and chief executive, said in a statement. The new corporate structure âgreatly enhancesâ the combined companyâs ability to compete for licensing deals and âimproves the economics of future business development opportunities for Salix,â Ms. Logan said. Salix joins a flood of United States companies that have sought to lower their taxes and free up money held overseas by acquiring a company abroad.  AbbVie, which was spun off from Abbott Laboratories last year, raised its bid on Tuesday to about $51 billion for Shire, an Irish drug maker that has previously rejected its offers. The medical device maker Medtronic agreed to buy Covidien for $42.9 billion last month, and Chiquita agreed to acquire the Irish fruit distributor Fyffess for $526 million in stock in March.  Last week, Destination Matenity, the operator of A Pea in the Pod and Motherhood Maternity stores in the United States, said that it had approached but was rebuffed twice in takeover bids for Mothercare, a British retailer of maternity and childrenâs products. And Pfizer unsuccessfully tried to acquire its British rival AstraZeneca before abandoning its bid in May. Pfizer, which offered to pay as much as $119 billion in cash and stock, can come back later this year with a renewed offer. The deals have not been without controversy as United States politicians seek to close the loophole behind such transactions and some potential partners, including AstraZeneca, have expressed concern about the execution risk of such deals. As part of the deal, Salix will own Cosmoâs United States patents for the gastrointestinal drugs rifamycin and Uceris and have rights of negotiation with respect to products Cosmo seeks to market in the United States. In addition, it will hold rights to patents in certain parts of the world including Canada, China and India. Salixâs shareholders will own just less than 80 percent of the combined company. The remainder will be owned by Cosmo Pharmaceuticals, which is based in Lainate, Italy. âIt was our strategic objective to find the best possible partner to market our products in the U.S. and to have a substantial financial interest in this,â Alessandro Della ChÃ¡, the Cosmo Pharmaceuticals chief executive, said in a statement. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. Salixâs executive team will continue to serve in their current roles in the combined company. Salix, based in Raleigh, N.C., develops and markets drugs to treat gastrointestinal diseases, including the drugs Apriso, Fulyzaq and Giazo. The company reported net income of $143 million in 2013. Salix was advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the law firms Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, and A&L Goodbody in Dublin. Cosmo Pharmaceuticals was advised by Jefferies and the law firms Procopio, Cory, Hargreaves & Savitch, and Byrne Wallace in Dublin.
