Portraits of women entrepreneurs. At the most recent meeting of the She Owns It business group, the owners were joined by a guest, Rebecca Cenni, founder of Atrium Staffing. This post continues the conversation with Ms. Cenni, who explained how her $140 million staffing and payroll firm differentiates itself. Deirdre Lord, who owns the Megawatt Hour, asked about Atrium’s competition. Ms. Cenni said her real competitors were other firms that are certified in their respective classifications, for example, as woman- or minority-owned businesses. Many of Atrium’s larger client companies have diversity initiatives that require them to consider certifications as part of their procurement process. In those cases, Atrium, which is certified as a woman-owned business by the Womenâs Business Enterprise National Council, has an edge over businesses without these certifications.  The group members wondered how else Atrium differentiates itself. Ms. Cenni said that after researching all of the other agencies in New York, she decided to âfocus around the talent and do whatâs best by them.â She said this approach allowed Atrium to “recruit and retain the best talent with nearly no marketing investment.” How exactly did Atrium demonstrate its focus on the candidate? By offering benefits, Ms. Cenni said. In doing so, she said, Atrium was a pioneer at the time, though âthere were some IT firms doing it for long-term positions.â Staffing seems like a difficult business to scale, Ms. Lord said, âbecause you need to be able to have someone who can identify that talent and train them in all of these different markets.â Beth Shaw, who owns YogaFit, agreed: âYou almost need the ability to duplicate yourself.” âItâs really tough,â Ms. Cenni said. âIâve got some offices that are doing great, and other offices that every month, every quarter, when I look at the P&L, I say, âIâm not really making money, Iâm not losing money.'” Recruiting is mostly about sales, she said, which is why the success of an office depends on the sales abilities of its recruiters. Atrium’s recruiters sell the company’s staffing services to the human resources departments of its clients, which include pharmaceutical, fashion and consumer products companies. Though it also handles larger projects, Atrium usually has from one to 30 workers at a client’s site. They typically fill administrative support positions in all departments, including finance, operations, creative and IT. It’s important that the recruiters “speak the language” of a particular field, Ms. Cenni said. Ms. Shaw asked whether Atrium trains its sales representatives. Yes,Â Ms. Cenni said, âwe have one of the best training programs, but it took me years to develop.” Every quarter, Atrium runs three weeks of training. âAnd you put them up and pay their travel and all that?â Ms. Shaw asked. âEverything,â Ms. Cenni replied. Alexandra Mayzler, who owns Thinking Caps Group, asked how long Ms. Cenni gives an office in a new location to succeed. âYou give yourself a year,â which includes six months for her recruiters to get up and running, she replied. At the six-month mark, she changes their compensation plan. âI take the risk in the beginning, the first six months, because I know itâs my investment,” she said. “Then, for them to make bigger commissions, we change that compensation plan.” âSo you lower their base?â Ms. Lord asked. âIt depends on the division,â Ms. Cenni said. âYou figure out what makes that person successful and then you tailor it,â Ms. Lord said. âExactly,” Ms. Cenni said, “but in the beginning when youâre opening something up, you have to partner really with people youâre taking on and invest in them, as much as youâre making that investment in the office. So, I say for talent it takes us six months, but we really look at a full year, what a full year looks like and then I compare offices against one another.” In the next post, Ms. Cenni will talk more about differentiation and other challenges, including delegating and decision-making.
