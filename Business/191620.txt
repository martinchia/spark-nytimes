Steven L. Rattner, the financier, and the Quadrangle Group, the private equity firm he once led, appear to have buried the hatchet. In a letter to investors dated Feb. 1, Quadrangle said that it had “amicably and conclusively resolved our disagreements” with Mr. Rattner, who co-founded the firm in 2000. Mr. Rattner had previously disclosed that he had brought arbitration claims against the firm over an unspecified amount of money he said he was owed after he left the firm in 2009.  The relationship between Mr. Rattner and Quadrangle soured when the Securities and Exchange Commission and Andrew M. Cuomo, then the New York attorney general, accused both parties of involvement in a New York pension scandal. The investigation centered on whether a state official had helped Quadrangle secure a $150 million allocation from the New York pension fund in exchange for improper payments. Mr. Rattner settled the S.E.C.’s investigation in 2010 by paying a $6.2 million settlement and agreeing to a two-year ban from certain investment work. He did not admit to any wrongdoing. In a subsequent settlement with Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Rattner agreed to a $10 million fine and a five-year ban from appearing before state pension boards. Quadrangle also settled claims brought against it by Mr. Cuomo and the S.E.C., paying $7 million to the pension fund and $5 million to the commission. At the time of the attorney general settlement, Quadrangle was unsparing in distancing itself from Mr. Rattner.  “We wholly disavow the conduct engaged in by Steve Rattner,” the firm said in a statement at the time. “That conduct was inappropriate, wrong, and unethical.  Mr. Rattner is no longer with the firm and is not a part of todayâs settlement.” Mr. Rattner has been enjoying something of a public renaissance since settling with the S.E.C. and Mr. Cuomo. In recent months, he has appeared on television news shows, written columns about private equity and seen the automotive industry’s restructuring, which he oversaw as President Obama‘s “car czar,” praised by Mr. Obama in the recent State of the Union address. Mr. Rattner is now the chairman of Willett Advisors, a firm that manages the fortune of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York,  a longtime friend of Mr. Rattner’s.  Last week’s letter, which was signed by Peter Ezersky, Quadrangle’s managing principal, and Michael Huber, its president, did not specify the amount of any settlement, or even whether a monetary settlement had been reached. Both Mr. Huber and Mr. Rattner declined to comment. Unlike the heated salvos of the past few years, the letter contained no traces of anger or resentment.  It simply said, “Quadrangle expresses its gratitude to Steve for his substantial contributions to the firm over the years, and we wish him continued success in the future.” Advertisement
