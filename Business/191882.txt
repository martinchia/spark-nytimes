				}); SUN VALLEY, Idaho — Goldman Sachs‘s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, certainly has his fair share of detractors. But the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett isnât one of them.  At the annual Allen & Company conference here, DealBook asked Mr. Buffett whether he thought Mr. Blankfein might resign from Goldman in the coming months. The Oracle of Omaha didnât mince words.   “I don’t think he is. I’ve seen nothing to indicate that myself, and I don’t want him to,â he said enthusiastically. “I want him to stay!”   Mr. Buffett came to Goldmanâs rescue in 2008 during the financial crisis, investing $5 billion in the Wall Street firm. It was a crucial lifeline for Goldman and a sweet deal for Mr. Buffett. He negotiated a 10 percent annual dividend on the deal, which amounted to about $500 million a year.  While Goldman paid back the money this year, Mr. Buffett still has a lucrative tie to the investment bank. Mr. Buffettâs holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, negotiated the right to buy $5 billion in stock with a strike price of $115. Those warrants are outstanding.  In Sun Valley, Mr. Buffett said his plans to exercise those warrants remained the same. He expects to do so in 2013 when they are set to expire.  âWe’ll wait till the last month or two, before their expiration,” he said. With Goldman stock is trading at roughly $135 a share, Mr. Buffett would stand to make a roughly $900 million profit if he exercised them today.  No wonder he likes Mr. Blankfein.  Advertisement
