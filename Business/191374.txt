LivingSocial is considering postponing an initial public offering in favor of collecting about $200 million in a fund-raising round that would value the online coupon company at about $6 billion, a person briefed on the matter told DealBook on Wednesday. The deliberations by LivingSocial come amid volatility in the markets, making a successful I.P.O. more difficult to pull off. The company’s biggest competitor, Groupon, recently pushed back its own stock sale by about a month, to October. Other companies, including the game maker Zynga, are also slowing down their I.P.O. plans, continuing to check the markets for signs of stability before proceeding. Instead of going public soon, LivingSocial may instead look to raise additional equity and debt, this person said, adding that the company had not yet finalized any plans. It is being advised by JPMorgan Chase, one of the lead underwriters for its I.P.O.  Like many of its peers, LivingSocial had tapped into investor excitement for new Internet companies to propel a rapid growth of its valuation. In April, it raised $400 million in a financing round that valued the company at $3 billion. By July, the company set a preliminary I.P.O. fund-raising target of about $1 billion, valuing it at about $10 billion to $15 billion, people briefed on the matter said previously. An I.P.O. would allow LivingSocial’s current investors — including Amazon, Lightspeed Venture Partners, T. Rowe Price and Institutional Venture Partners — to cash out at least some of their holdings. Beyond JPMorgan, LivingSocial’s other lead I.P.O. advisers were Deutsche Bank and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  News of LivingSocial’s deliberations was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.
