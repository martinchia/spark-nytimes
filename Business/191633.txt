Are federal workers really overpaid?  Public sector pay is a subject of long-simmering dispute — examined in previous posts on this blog. Many right-leaning organizations argue that federal workers make more than their private-sector counterparts and that the disparity is growing. Many left-leaning research groups and labor groups argue that the idea that Washington overpays workers is a myth, and that superficial disparities in compensation are due to public employeesâ greater tendency to have advanced degrees and to be older. Which side is right? In a report released Monday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office answered: both. Here is the relevant chart: Less-educated federal workers make a bit more than their private-sector counterparts and receive more generous benefits. Workers with a complete or incomplete college education or a masterâs degree tend to make about the same amount, again with more generous benefits. But highly educated federal workers earn less than their peers in the private sector.  The Congressional Budget Office went further than some other studies in ensuring a comparison of apples to apples — controlling for a workerâs education, years of experience, occupation, neighborhood, age, sex, ethnicity and immigration status, among other characteristics.
