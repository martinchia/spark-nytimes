It appears that Ronald W. Burkle isn’t content to simply buy a membership for the Soho House line of luxury clubs. Instead, he’s buying control of the company. The Soho House Group announced on Friday that it had sold a majority stake to Mr. Burkle’s Yucaipa Companies and named the billionaire investor as its new chairman. The company’s founder, Nick Jones, will remain chief executive. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but a person briefed on the matter said that Mr. Burkle had purchased a 60 percent stake for about Â£250 million, or about $383 million.  The deal will reduce the holdings of Soho House’s current majority owner, the British entrepreneur Richard Caring, to about 30 percent. Mr. Caring gained the stake in a 2008 investment. Founded in 1995 in London, Soho House has grown into an international proprietor of upscale members-only clubs, with a notoriously selective admittance process. The company plans to use Mr. Burkle’s investment to finance further international expansion. Over the next two years, Soho House plans to open clubs in Mumbai, Istanbul, Toronto and Chicago to supplement its existing nine locations in Europe and the United States. “Ron Burkleâs industry experience, investment success and understanding of the Soho House Group make him a natural partner,” Mr. Jones said in a statement.  In an e-mail to Soho House members, Mr. Jones added, “Though weâve had a number of interested parties table offers for Soho House in the last few years, I believe that Ron shares our vision, and provides us with the backing, to expand and improve our clubs whilst remaining true to our original ethos going forwards.” The investment isn’t Mr. Burkle’s first foray into luxury hospitality. In 2009, Yucaipa invested $75 million in the Morgans Hotel Group, the company that helped create the boutique hotel concept nearly 30 years ago. And Mr. Burkle has been seen spending time in the Soho House in Manhattan’s meatpacking district. Mr. Burkle said in a statement on Friday, “We believe that the combination of Yucaipa’s track record and the unique leadership position that Nick and Richard have created in this space will result in the continued global growth of the brand.â Advertisement
