Could another big airline merger take off? The president of American Airlines‘ parent company hopes so. Thomas W. Horton, president of the AMR Corporation, told The Times of London that he hoped to see a merger of his company with the International Airlines Group, which owns British Airways and Iberia. There is just one issue right now: United States law prohibits foreign entities from owning more than 25 percent of an American airline. But Mr. Horton said he hoped that would change in his lifetime. American Airlines and British Airways already have an alliance in which the two share revenue and coordinate flight schedules. Mr. Horton said that a formal merger of the two was an inevitable next step: “This alliance agreement with B.A. and I.A.G. is effectively a synthetic merger. Over time — I think in my working lifetime — foreign ownership rules in the U.S. will become more flexible. This alliance could form the basis of a cross-border merger between our airlines.” The International Airlines Group is the far bigger company, with a market value of $7 billion compared with AMR’s $1.36 billion. Shares in AMR were down 3.3 percent, at $4.10, in late morning trading on Monday. Shares in the International Airlines Group were down 2.9 percent, at 230.5 pence. Advertisement
