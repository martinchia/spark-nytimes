Earning the coveted white identification badge that grants a select few access to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, is tough enough. The last year has demonstrated that it is not easy to keep it either. Just look at Masataka Shimizu. Mr. Shimizu said last year on the private social network operated by the World Economic Forum that his company, Tokyo Electric Power, sought to provide a “stable supply of electricity and environmental protection.” That was before an earthquake and tsunami struck Japan in March, damaging the companyâs nuclear power facility in Fukushima and unleashing a radiation threat that displaced more than 160,000 people in Japan and could pose risks to the nationâs food supply. Mr. Shimizu, who resigned as chief executive of the power company in May, is just one of many people among the global elite in Davos last year who is not likely to be seen this year in the corridors of the Davos Congress Center or at the Steigenberger Grandhotel BelvÃ©dÃ¨re, the prestige party location. A close comparison of the World Economic Forum guest lists of 2011 and 2012  provides something of a chronicle of the scandals, disasters and corporate ousters that have taken place in the last 12 months. Was it only a year ago that Prime Minister George A. Papandreou of Greece assured fellow participants that his country was on track to get its debt problems under control? Mr. Papandreou, who resigned in November as a result of his countryâs sovereign debt crisis, is not expected at Davos this year. Nor is Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, which runs the British newspaper operations of News Corporation. Ms. Brooks resigned in July after accusations that, while she was editor of the British tabloid News of the World, the publication had intercepted the voice mails of celebrities and of a girl who had been abducted and murdered. Ms. Brooks, once one of the most powerful people in Britain’s news media, has denied knowing at the time about the phone hacking. And do not expect to find Dominique Strauss-Kahn, former president of the International Monetary Fund and once a Davos mainstay, at the Swiss ski resort this year. Even though a sexual assault case against Mr. Strauss-Kahn was dismissed in New York in August, the scandal cost him a place in the inner circle of people who set global economic policy. In one sense, the presence of so many newsmakers at Davos — even fallen ones — is a testament to the appeal the World Economic Forum annual meeting has for powerful people. That is why the meeting perennially draws intense interest from the news media, despite rarely producing much in the way of  concrete news. But the fate of some of these newsmakers may also feed another common criticism: that Davos provides a venue for a powerful group of people to pose, at times, as more modern and enlightened than they might actually be. An example in that category might be Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, a former World Economic Forum Young Global Leader whose reputation as a westernized reformer vaporized when he vowed on television last year that “rivers of  blood” would flow in response to an uprising in Libya against his father, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. In February, the World Economic Forum, the organization in Geneva that organizes the annual meeting in Davos, stripped the younger Mr. Qaddafi of that title. Mr. Qaddafi “was appointed as a Young Global Leader at a time when it appeared that he represented the potential for a future Libyan government that was more progressive, more concerned for human rights and more open to the possibilities of political reform,” David Aikman, head of the Forum of Young Global Leaders, said in a statement at the time. Losing his Davos privileges is the least of the younger Mr. Qaddafiâs worries, of course. He did not attend the Davos forum in early 2011, and his father was overthrown and then killed in October. Mr. Qaddafi was captured by militia leaders in November and now awaits trial. Every year, the ouster of chief executives contributes to turnover in Davos. The 2011 roster of top executives who lost their jobs, and their Davos badges, includes LÃ©o Apotheker of Hewlett-Packard; Oswald J. GrÃ¼bel of the Swiss bank UBS; and Hartmut Ostrowski of Bertelsmann, the giant German media concern. These examples offer cautionary tales for the chief executives converging in Davos this year, though perhaps none so powerful as that offered by Rajat K. Gupta. Last year, he was listed on the Davos roster as chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Gupta, a former director of Goldman Sachs, has since been charged with conspiracy and securities fraud. He has pleaded not guilty. He will not be in Davos this year, either. Advertisement
