What if the government knows a crime is about to take place but does nothing to stop it and instead allows the crime to happen so it can gather additional evidence for a later prosecution?  When the crime is insider trading, perhaps the fact that there are no individual victims justifies allowing someone to use confidential information to earn illegal profits. But there is still something troubling when a crime that can be easily stopped is allowed to occur. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed criminal and civil complaints last week against Michael A. Lucarelli for trading on information about clients of the investor relations firm Lippert/Heilshorn and Associates. After his arrest, Mr. Lucarelli, who was the director of market intelligence for the firm. was last seen fleeing barefoot from the federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan. The case is a fairly straightforward application of the insider trading laws to someone with access to confidential corporate information who took it for his own use, making nearly $1 million in profits according to the S.E.C.  Prosecutors charged him with making 13 trades in seven companies that used Lippert/Heilshorn, while the S.E.C. complaint identified trading in the stock of six additional firm clients that it said was based on inside information. An affidavit filed with the criminal complaint highlights an interesting twist in how the Federal Bureau of Investigation secured evidence.  On July 24, federal agents used a search warrant to look at the contents of Mr. Lucarelliâs locked briefcase in his office at Lippert/Heilshorn while he was away. Inside was a draft of a news release for Trex Company, a firm client, about improved sales and income. When the company disclosed the financial information on Aug. 4, its stock price jumped nearly 15 percent. The agents photographed the document and then returned it to the original position âso as not to prematurely advise Lucarelli of the existence of our investigation.â The cloak-and-dagger approach continued, as DealBook reported, with Lippert/Heilshorn keeping him on as an employee until his arrest, even though it was aware of his trading for more than a month. It appears the government had already pieced together enough to show that Mr. Lucarelli used information about a number of clients based on his trading pattern and access to confidential information. Yet he was allowed to buy Trex stock in the days after the search. He ended up selling 37,400 shares for a profit of nearly $90,000 on Aug. 4.  The evidence obtained in the search directly linked Mr. Lucarelli to information he took from Lippert/Heilshorn that he was not authorized to access, making it difficult for him to deny a breach of fiduciary duty or to somehow claim that he just got lucky in his investments. Much like wiretaps proved to be powerful evidence against the hedge fund chief Raj Rajaratnam and others, this type of real-time evidence of trading on inside information is rarely seen, so it has a powerful allure.   It is not uncommon for the government to engage in tactics that let it get a close-up view of criminal activity. Undercover agents are placed inside criminal organizations to report on their activities without trying to prevent any illegal actions, and sting operations that involve buying stolen property may well encourage sellers to commit crimes. Even the disputed gun-trafficking investigation by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, called Operation Fast and Furious, allowed illegal conduct by permitting guns to be bought for âstraw purchasers.â  White-collar crimes are different from ordinary street crimes, however, because the government does not have to infiltrate an illegal organization. Most white-collar offenses involve ordinary business activity in which the crucial issue is a defendantâs intent, not gaining the trust of confederates by encouraging illegal activity. The victim of insider trading is usually identified as the market because no one deals directly with the person misusing confidential information for personal gain. Trading is usually conducted through anonymous securities markets in which hundreds of orders are placed, often by computer programs. Buyers have no idea who is on the other side of the transaction or why they are selling their shares. When Mr. Lucarelli bought Trex stock, he abused his obligation to Lippert/Heilshorn, and harmed the confidence of investors who expect that trading in the market will be fair. But unlike an ordinary fraud in which there is an identifiable victim, this type of violation entails a more diffuse harm. That may explain why the government was willing to let Mr. Lucarelli continue trading on inside information so it could catch him red-handed. Investigators would not be expected to allow a defendant to commit an armed robbery, but insider trading does not have a comparable threat to individuals — at least as long as the profits can be seized before the trader spends them. But the case does raise the larger question of whether the government should permit someone to trade on inside information when it has already amassed a fairly solid case to prove the crime. Mr. Lucarelli used four different brokerage accounts over two years, moving to new firms twice when his brokers shut down the accounts, most likely because of suspicions about his prescient trades. Computer records show that he accessed internal firm documents about upcoming earnings and other corporate events that he had no reason to view, and the bulk of his trading was in the stock of Lippert/Heilshorn clients. That adds up to a pretty strong circumstantial case. That last little bit of trading, coupled with the search of his briefcase, was the cherry on the sundae, making a good case even better. But it came at the cost of allowing insider trading to continue, costing investors nearly $90,000 when Mr. Lucarelli sold his Trex shares after the earnings announcement. There is an argument that insider trading does not cause any perceptible harm to the markets because the number of trades involving confidential information is small. Most transactions, especially by the often-vilified high frequency trading firms, have nothing to do with the specifics of a company but rather whether there is a small disparity in the price that allows for a quick — if minuscule — profit.  Mr. Lucarelliâs purchases were not even a drop in the bucket compared with the value of the shares traded on the stock exchanges in any single day.   But the mantra of the government has been that prosecuting insider trading protects the integrity of the securities markets by combating the perception that the markets are somehow rigged in favor of those with special access to information.  In 2010, Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, whose office is prosecuting Mr. Lucarelli, told the New York City Bar Association that âit will come as no surprise to anyone here that I believe illegal insider trading is extremely significant and should be to everyone who cares about the protection of confidential information and the integrity of the markets.â Catching an insider trader is usually a good thing. But when the investigation results in allowing a  crime to take place, then there is a question whether the government should have stood by and watched as someone abused a position of trust and fiddled with the integrity of the market.
