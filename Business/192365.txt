LONDON â Flexing some of its new regulatory muscle, Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority prohibited banks on Tuesday from selling high-yield bonds called CoCos to retail investors. CoCo bonds, which are known formally as contingent convertible securities, are popular in Europe as banks try to shore up their capital levels without causing too much harm to returns. They are unique because they convert to equity as a result of some triggering event. For most of the banks issuing the bonds, the trigger is capital falling below a certain threshold. Regulators like them because they offer an instant increase to capital cushions in times of crisis, in theory preventing taxpayers from having to bail out banks. Investors like them because they have a high return. The market is small, with banks having issued only about 40 billion pounds of such bonds so far. (One ancillary benefit of CoCos is that they are a new product for banks to underwrite in addition to aiding their capital structures.) But some have forecast that issuance will grow to Â£160 billion by 2020, leading the authority to preclude retail investors from buying them before they have even tried.  The agency estimates that retail investors â mostly individuals with high net worth â hold about Â£8 billion of the bonds. They will continue to be able to invest in CoCos because they are wealthy enough to understand the risks, but the new rules prevent ordinary investors from being tempted by the bonds’ attractive returns. The ban is to start on Oct. 1 and last a year. âIn a low-interest-rate environment, many investors might be tempted by CoCos offering high headline returns,â said Christopher Woolard, the authority’s director of policy, risk and research. âHowever, they are complex and can be highly risky, and the F.C.A. has used its new powers to ensure that CoCos are not inappropriately made available to the mass retail market while still allowing access for experienced investors.â Here is how the authority described scary CoCos: âCoCos can be written off (in part or entirely) or converted into equity when the issuerâs capital position falls, while issuers can have unusually broad discretion in relation to coupon payments, making it extremely difficult for investors to assess, understand and price CoCos. At present there is little experience of how CoCos operate in practice.â Here is a link to a video from The Financial Times that explains the bonds. (You have to wait to get through a description of hybrid capital to get to the CoCos. But it is well worth your while if you like videos about corporate finance.)  This is the first time the authority has used its consumer protection powers, which went into effect in April 2013. They allow the authority to impose restrictions to protect consumers if it sees warning signs. The restriction lasts for a year, during which time it can consult on permanent measures. The ban comes after announcements by the European Securities and Markets Authority and the Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities, pointing out some of the risks of CoCos.  Those risks include investors’ struggling to value the bonds in light of changing regulatory capital requirements and uncertainty about bank capital levels, as well as many of the technical aspects of the bonds.  A J.P. Morgan Asset Management blog entry from February about CoCos better captures some of the complexities. It says: âThe host instrument for a CoCo can be a T2 instrument with mandatory coupon language and a fixed maturity date, or a Tier 1 non-step perpetual with a call date that tends to range from 5 to 10 years and fully discretionary coupon features.â  Hence, the retail ban.
