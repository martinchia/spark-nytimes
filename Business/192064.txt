Whatâs affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week? HEY, UMAIR, LIGHTEN UP The business world keeps an eye on Egypt. Forbes’s Brian Wingfield discusses the business of evacuation. Umair Haque writes in the Harvard Business Review that Egypt’s revolution is coming to an economy very near you. âThe challenge of the democratic, developed world,” he writes, “is a quieter rebellion: against a bankruptcy not just of the pocketbook but of meaning. It’s not to take a stand against a dictator, but to take a stand against an unenlightened, nihilistic, hyperconsumerist, soul-suckingly unfulfilling, lethally short-termist ethos that inflicts real and relentless damage on people, society, the natural world and future generations.â A BIG WEEK FOR THE INTERNET The Internet gets turned off in Egypt. The United States mulls doing the same. Slateâs Bruce Gottlieb writes about the subtle, obscure and legalistic ways the government controls the Internet. Oh, whatever â¦ itâs running out of addresses anyway. THE WHITE HOUSE LIKES US The White House announced a new small-business initiative to promote entrepreneurship.

President Obama will make this business owner money in 2011.  CONGRESS LIKES US Dan Danner of the National Federation of Independent Business says itâs a small-business Congress: âHaving so many small-business people in Washington is outstanding news for the small-business community nationwide. These members of Congress know, on the deepest level, that the best way to create jobs and encourage economic growth is to get out of the way, and off the backs, of small businesses.â The bloggers at Small Business Labs say we can get used to a lot of voices representing us in Washington. But wait … theyâre considering cutting back the Small Business Administration, too. THE STATES LIKE US The State of Maryland makes it easy for small businesses. State tax revenues nationwide continue to rise. The State of Virginia releases a new Web site designed for small-business owners.

Real financial sales were up 7.1 percent. Maybe this is the beginning of something good.â Commercial printing is up 4.8 percent. Car sales are up, but compared to what? Institute for Supply Management manufacturing numbers are up. Construction spending drops to a nine-year low. A new Citibank survey reveals a meaningful increase in economic optimism for 2011.

HEALTH CARE HITS ANOTHER BUMP The repeal of health care legislation fails in the Senate. A Federal judge in Florida rules that the health care reform act is unconstitutional. The N.F.I.B. explains why it’s happy with the ruling. Business groups are also happy. Clive Crook is not surprised: âVoiding the law, Iâm sure, is not something a majority will want to do, even if public opinion remains (moderately) opposed to the reform. But (the Supreme Court) will want to come up with a rationale for letting the law stand that does not give the feds carte blanche.â The 1099 provision is repealed by the Senate. An expert summarizes how health care reform will affect small businesses. WE ROCK United States factories out-produce Chinese factories by more than 40 percent.
