E.J. Manuel, a 24-year-old quarterback with the Buffalo Bills, had a rough time in his rookie season last year, when injuries forced him to miss six games. On Wall Street, his stock got an uncertain reception from investors. Shares linked to the future income of Mr. Manuel started trading on Monday on an exchange operated by Fantex, a Silicon Valley start-up that helps athletes raise money through public offerings of stock. The firm previously sold shares linked to Vernon Davis of the San Francisco 49ers. The offering of 523,700 shares received a significant amount of support from Fantex itself. Unable to sell all of the Manuel stock to investors, the company stepped in to buy 250,000 shares, or 48 percent of the total amount offered, according to Buck French, the chief executive. This level of support was expected, Mr. French said. Despite the slack demand, the stock was trading higher in its debut on Monday. After opening for trading at $10 at noon, the shares were up 15 percent in early afternoon trading. âAs we prime the pump and get the platform up and running, we expect on these guys that weâll purchase a percentage of them,” Mr. French said on Monday. “We would have loved to sell them all, but at the end of the day, we didn’t want to keep dragging out the offering.” The completion of the deal may help Fantex attract more athletes and investors to its novel business. Mr. Davis, a tight end whose stock began trading in April, said recently that he had no regrets. If all goes according to plan, Fantex will do its third deal with a football player later this year. Mr. Manuel earned $4.98 million through the offering. In exchange, he signed away 10 percent of all future football-related income, including from his playing contract, corporate endorsements and any movies he should star in or memoirs he might write. Investors in the stock are taking a number of risks. The most apparent of these is that Mr. Manuel is a relatively green player whose knees gave him a considerable amount of trouble last season. If he is forced to miss more games or is cut from the team, his income stream could dry up. Beyond what happens on the field, investors accept risks associated with Fantex, a closely held start-up with little track record. The Manuel shares, which technically are shares of Fantex, confer no direct legal right to Mr. Manuelâs income. Although Fantex says it will pay dividends,Â  and has already announced a dividend on the Davis shares, dividends are not guaranteed. Fantex is promoting Mr. Manuel as “fearless,” with a slick promotional video showing him alternately working out on a football field and riding a moving walkway in a business suit. “I don’t think there’s any magic potion to going out and being successful,” Mr. Manuel says in the voiceover. “You just have to work.” Investors appeared to be receptive. The Manuel stock, which was available to reserve for $10 a share last week, was trading as high as $11.50 a share on Monday, without any significant news. Meanwhile, the Davis stock, which had risen as high as $12.50 in recent months, was hovering at $10 on Monday, flat from its offering price. Fantex hopes those two deals are just the beginning of a string of athlete offerings. The company announced on Monday that shares linked to Mohamed Sanu, a wide receiver for the Cincinnati Bengals, would be available to reserve starting on Aug. 4.
