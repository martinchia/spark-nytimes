The Shaw Group announced plans to sell its stake in Westinghouse to Toshiba in a deal that would allow Shaw to bolster its balance sheet.  Under the terms of the transaction, Shaw, which acquired 20 percent of Westinghouse in 2006, will exercise its put options, requiring Toshiba to buy the shares. By offloading the investment in the nuclear power company, Shaw will be able to eliminate $1.7 billion of debt. “We firmly believe that exercising the put options is in the best interest of our shareholders and our future business opportunities,” J.M. Bernhard Jr., Shaw’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. “Toshiba, Westinghouse and Shaw have worked together successfully both in the U.S and China, and we look forward to continuing to work together. We remain committed to our role as a premier constructor of nuclear power plants.”  Toshiba bought a 77 percent stake in Westinghouse in October 2006, with the remaining piece going to Shaw and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported news of the deal. Advertisement
