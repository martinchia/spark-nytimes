William H. Gross, the co-founder of the mutual fund giant Pimco who abruptly quit last month to join a much smaller mutual fund company, has in the past peppered his market commentary with upbeat and zany humor. But on Thursday, in his first investment remarks in his new role at the Janus Capital Group, Mr. Gross did not disguise his pessimism about the markets or his disappointment over being forced to leave Pimco. “Had there been a reasonable way to continue there, I would have stayed to my last breath,â Mr. Gross said in a letter accompanying his investment outlook note, seeming to acknowledge reports that top executives at his employer had been pushing for his ouster. “But slowly and with great hesitation, I came to understand that it was time for me to leave,â he continued. “It happens sometimes to founders! But that is water under the bridge, as they say.â The remarks were part of Mr. Grossâs formal introduction to Janus clients. On Thursday morning, he sat with Richard M. Weil, the head of Janus, for a webcast in which Mr. Weil lavished praise on his new colleague, and Mr. Gross used a sailing analogy and a reference to James Bond to describe the current state of his career. âThey say in James Bond-speak that you only live twice,â said Mr. Gross, 70, who wore a dark suit and had a bandage under his right eye. âI expect to live a happy second life at Janus Capital.â (A spokeswoman said the bandage was the result of a “minor dermatological procedure.”) Many investors were not thrilled with the turn of events. In September, investors pulled $23.5 billion from the giant bond fund that Mr. Gross managed at Pimco, with the largest redemptions coming on the day he resigned. The fund Mr. Gross will manage at Janus received just $66.4 million in deposits during that same month. Mr. Gross said on Thursday that he had “a certain empathyâ for “clients of both Janus and Pimco that have suffered disruptions to their portfolio.â But he predicted, “itâs going to be a better few weeks and few months going forward.â Saying he had observed a red sky the previous evening, Mr. Gross used a nautical epigram: âThey say in sailor speak, red sky at night, sailorâs delight. That means the next morning will be very smooth sailing.â But over the long term, he said, the investing outlook is more grim. Addressing themes he has mentioned in the past, Mr. Gross argued in his investment outlook note that financial markets were priced at âartificiallyâ high levels, attributable, in part, to the extraordinary stimulus by the Federal Reserve. He offered an adage to investors: âRecognize that times have changed,â Mr. Gross said during the webcast. âYes, we may only live twice, and this second financial era may be alive and well, but it wonât be the same as the one in the past. “Itâs not a warning, itâs just a heads up,â he added. âReturns are going to be lower than in the old days. Thatâs just too bad. Itâs too bad for Janus Capital, itâs too bad for Bill Gross, and itâs too bad for investors. âWe all profit when markets are moving up,â he added, “but bye-bye to those days.â Mr. Gross expanded on these themes in his investment outlook note, while also relaying an anecdote about dancing with his wife one day in September, after years of abstaining. “We dipped, we twirled, I even did a bop or two. Travolta would have been proud,â he said in the note, which was called âYou Only Dance Twice.â But while the ending of the anecdote was joyous â “it turned out to be just like a fairy taleâ â Mr. Gross then modulated to a minor key. “Picture perfection or fairy tale endings,â he wrote, “do not describe the global economy or even its financial markets.â A version of this article appears in print on 10/10/2014, on page B7 of the NewYork edition with the headline: A Pessimistic Bond King Strikes a Gloomy Note.
