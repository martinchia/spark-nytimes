Government officials made no secret of their displeasure when Standard & Poorâs downgraded the debt of the United States in 2011.  But, according to Standard & Poorâs, that indignation led to more than harsh words. It also motivated the governmentâs lawsuit last year that accused S.& P. of fraud, the ratings agency claims. Now, S.&P. is using an account of a conversation between Timothy F. Geithner, the former Treasury secretary, and Harold W. McGraw III, the chairman of S.&P.âs parent company, to bolster its defense. In a telephone call in August 2011, days after the downgrade was announced, an angry Mr. Geithner told Mr. McGraw that S.&P. had made an error in its assessment and that âyou are accountable for that,â according to an affidavit by Mr. McGraw that was filed on Monday in United States District Court for the Central District of California. âYou have done an enormous disservice to yourselves and to your country,â Mr. Geithner said, according to Mr. McGraw. The conduct of S.&P. would be âlooked at very carefully.â  A spokeswoman for Mr. Geithner, Jenni LeCompte, said in an email: “The allegation that former Secretary Geithner threatened or took any action to prompt retaliatory government action against S.&P. is false.â At the time of the downgrade — which represented the first time any major credit rating agency had removed the United States government from its list of risk-free borrowers — the Treasury Department issued a harsh critique of the methodology used by S.&P., saying its math was wrong. That war of words resurfaced in 2013, when S.&P. was trying to fend off the Justice Departmentâs first — and, to date, only — significant action against the credit rating industry. The department claimed in its suit that S.&P. inflated the ratings of mortgage investments, setting them up for a crash when the financial crisis struck. After trying unsuccessfully to get the lawsuit dismissed, S.&P. claimed in September that the legal action amounted to âretaliationâ for the government downgrade, a claim the government denied.
