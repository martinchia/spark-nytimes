Ingersoll-Rand has agreed to acquire Cameron International’s centrifugal compression division for $850 million. The deal, announced on Monday, is Ingersoll-Rand’s largest since it acquired Trane, the maker of indoor heating and air-conditioning systems, for $10.1 billion in 2007, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ data. More recently, Ingersoll-Rand has been focused on streamlining, as it faced pressure from the activist investor Nelson Peltz. Last year, the company spun off its combined home and commercial security operations. The business being acquired makes centrifugal compression equipment and aftermarket parts and services for global industrial applications, air separation, gas transmission and process gas. Based in Houston, it has 850 employees and had revenue of $396 million last year.  Ingersoll-Rand said the acquisition would be financed by a combination of cash on hand and debt, and that it would be accretive to its earnings per share in 2015. The price represents a multiple of 10.5 times the division’s estimated 2015 earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization, the company said. Cameron said it expected that its proceeds from the sale after taxes would be around $600 million. The proceeds will be used for stock buybacks, the company said. JPMorgan Chase and the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett served as advisers to Ingersoll Rand. Citigroup and the law firms Winston & Strawn and Baker Botts advised Cameron.
