B&G Foods loves Mrs. Dash. In a deal that will greatly expand its cabinet of household items, B&G Foods will pay $325 million in cash to buy Mrs. Dash seasoning and five other lesser-known brands. The deal, announced Friday, was struck with the American subsidiary of Unilever, which has been paring the portfolio of kitchen items it acquired with its $3.7 billion purchase of Alberto Culver last fall.  Besides Mrs. Dash, Unilever agreed to sell three other cooking products — Bakers Joy, Molly McButter and Sugar Twin — to B&G. It also parted with Static Guard spray and Kleen Guard furniture polish, which have also become household staples.  B&G Foods, whose cupboard was already stocked with more than 20 product lines, including Ortega taco mix and Cream of Wheat cereal, hopes the additional items will improve its bottom line. The six brands generated about $90 million in sales over the last year, and B&G said it expected it to add $35 million to $38 million in pretax earnings in fiscal 2012.  David L. Wenner, B&Gâs chief executive, said that he had his eye on Mrs. Dash for more than  a decade and that the deal would fit with the companyâs strategy of acquiring smaller brands with big profit margins. âWe always thought this was a great property,â he said in an interview. âIt has a wonderful niche in the seasoning categoryâ since it does not contain salt. The deal is subject to regulatory approval, but is expected to close later this year. All of the products are broadly recognizable. But Mrs. Dash, no relation to this reporter, is perhaps the best known of the brands. The seasoning â made up of onion, black pepper, celery seed and a half-dozen other herbs and spices â was the brainchild of an Alberto Culver marketing executive looking for an easy way to flavor food without using salt.  The original formula hit supermarkets in the early 1980s. Its bright yellow shaker and catchy âI Love Mrs. Dashâ slogan quickly caught on with consumers â and as a punch line for schoolyard barbs. But the seasoning did not always carry its now now-famous name. Executives considered calling it Mrs. Pinch, before settling on Mrs. Dash.  New flavors of Mrs. Dash seasoning were added to the lineup over the last decade or so, as more health-conscious consumers and baby boomers facing low-sodium diet restrictions sought out the brand. Papa Dash, a lite salt, established a loyal following but was pulled from production in the fall of 2000 as a result of declining sales.  But Mrs. Dash and the other kitchen goods did not fit with the lineup of hair-care products, like VO5 and Nexxus, that were the cornerstone of Alberto Culver brands â and the main reason that Unilever bought the company in September 2010. As a result, Unilever was widely expected to put them up for sale.  B&G, based in Parsippany, N.J, said that it began participating in an auction for the products about six weeks ago but was not notified until Thursday morning that it had submitted the winning bid. None of the other bidders were identified.  Mr. Wenner, who said he spiced up home-cooked Italian dinners with the no-salt seasoning, said he did not think Mrs. Dash needed much of an update and was impressed with how well the brand had held up over the years. It offers recipes on its Web site and even has its own Facebook page (where you can âlikeâ Mrs. Dash).  âWe are thrilled,â he said of the deal.  Advertisement
