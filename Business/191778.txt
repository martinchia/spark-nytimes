 Oprah Winfrey has written a new book collecting some of her insights about life’s struggles and inspirations, her publisher said on Wednesday. The book, “What I Know for Sure,” is adapted from Ms. Winfrey’s regular column in O, The Oprah Magazine, which carries the same title. “What I Know for Sure” is set for release in September. Organized by themes including joy, awe and possibility, the book offers “readers a guide to becoming their best selves,” a statement from the publisher said. It is the first acquisition for Flatiron Books, a new nonfiction imprint of Macmillan. A version of this article appears in print on March 13, 2014, on Page C3 of the New York edition with the headline: A New Winfrey Book.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
