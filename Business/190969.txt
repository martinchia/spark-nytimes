The Sealy Corporation is striking back against a top investor that is pushing to remake the board of the mattress maker. In a letter on Friday to H Partners, a hedge fund that owns 14.5 percent of the company, Sealy said that it “would like to express our disappointment at your unwillingness to work cooperatively with members of Sealyâs management team.”  The mattress maker has “taken extensive steps to be responsive to you,” Gary E. Morin, a board member, wrote in the letter. Sealy also took aim at the tone of H Partners’ complaints, which the company called “combative.”  The hedge fund’s concerns center on Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity giant that holds 46.2 percent of Sealy. H Partners complained this month about what it calls K.K.R.’s âdominanceâ on the board.  H Partners sent Sealy a letter outlining its concerns and calling for a seat on the board. Nine directors, the hedge fund wrote, have âcurrent or previous affiliationsâ with K.K.R, an indication it said that even the board’s independent directors were not truly independent.  In the reply letter, released as part of a regulatory filing on Friday, Sealy said it would “correct some of the facts that you misinterpret.” “Our board has not changed since you invested in Sealy in the spring of 2011, and its composition is sound,” Sealy said in the letter.  Sealy acknowledged that one independent director, James Johnston, was employed by a K.K.R.-controlled company from 1989 to 1995. But he has not been affiliated with K.K.R. since, Sealy said, adding that Mr. Johnston joined the board in 1993, more than a decade before K.K.R. invested in the company.   K.K.R. agreed to buy Sealy in 2004 for $1.5 billion, paying roughly $5.78 a share for the company. The private equity firm took the company public two years later at $16 a share. But Sealy’s stock price and profits have since suffered. In fiscal 2011, the company lost $9.8 million, following a $13.7 million loss the previous year. The stock currently trades for $1.77. “We recognize you are disappointed with Sealyâs recent performance in 2011 and we have made it clear that we did not deliver financial results in line with the goals and objectives we strove to achieve,” Sealy said in its letter to H Partners. “We continue to be open to constructive suggestions from shareholders that are in the long-term interest of the Company.” In a statement on Friday, an H Partners spokesman said that âSealyâs response fails to address the boardâs and K.K.R.âs significant role in the destruction of shareholder value at the company.  We are carefully reviewing all of our options.â Advertisement
