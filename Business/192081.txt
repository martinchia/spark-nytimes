A new paper finds that divorce rates tend to rise during recessions, but only for couples that have been married for more than five years and less than 10 years. As the authors — Jeremy Arkes and Yu-Chu Shen, both of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif. — note, a weak economy is likely to cause financial strain, which in turn can cause marital strain. On the other hand, a strong economy is likely to make spouses feel more independent — because both can find work — and potentially more willing to split up. The authors dig into marriage data to see which force prevails. Their conclusion: For couples in years six to 10 of marriage, it appears that the financial strain from weak economic periods has a greater toll on the marriage, as the countercyclical forces dominate the procyclical forces. For couples in their first five years of marriage, perhaps some of these effects cancel each other out or are very small. We speculate that young couples would be less likely to have children and less likely to have mortgage payments, so they may be able to better withstand unemployment experiences. For couples married more than 10 years, there are two potential explanations for their ability to withstand the economic crisis. First, it is possible that marriages that last that as long as 10 years are stable enough that they would not be affected by financial problems. Second, these older couples would have more expensive housing needs (from having children and higher standards as they get older), so that the weak economy affects the affordability of divorces more for couples in this category, perhaps counteracting the effects of the financial strain when the economy is weak. The main point from this research, however, is that the current economic crisis is probably not affecting the stability of marriage for newly-married or long-lasting couples, but the economic crisis is likely causing more divorces for couples in years six to 10 of marriage. The paper, yet to be peer reviewed, is called “For Better or for Worse, But How About a Recession?” and is available on the Web site of the National Bureau of Economic Research. Catherine Rampell looks at, and links to, some of the other evidence on this question in this post. Another post also looked at a study showing that finance-related tensions in a marriage raise the risk of divorce.
