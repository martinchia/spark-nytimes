 The Republican Party has just achieved a thundering political victory, largely by running against the Democratic incumbents, but the G.O.P. is unlikely to repeat this performance in 2012 as the party of no. According to a Pew Research Poll, only 41 percent of Americans approve of Republicansâ policies and plans for the future. To create a viable, popular party, the Republicans are going to need to offer a vision of American economic renewal based on the twin pillars of economic freedom and vastÂ  investment in human capital. Events this fall conspired to make it easy for Republicans to win by focusing on smaller government. Itâs easy to understand why the public might want a little more public restraint, after expensive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, intrusive homeland security measures from the Patriot Act to the current brouhaha over airport screening, the growing public role in health under both President Bush and President Obama, and a huge fiscal effort to prevent a great recession from becoming something even worse. My fellow economists who argue that it would take a much bigger stimulus to materially reduce unemployment are surely right, but that doesnât imply that the benefits of reducing the unemployment rate by a few percentage points outweigh the costs of spending a few trillion dollars.Â Â  The voters who elected Republicans because they thought that the government had grown big enough expressed an eminently understandable viewpoint. But if Republicans actually follow through on their electoral promises, then the growth of government will stop, since the House of Representatives has the power of the purse.Â Â Â  If the growth of government stops, then the electoral appeal of a smaller state will decline, and Republicans will need another arrow in their quiver.Â Â  Since Franklin Roosevelt, it has taken more than just an appeal for less government â the Alf Landon strategy â to put a Republican in the White House. Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan and both Bushes all played a powerful national security card. Presidents Reagan and both Bushes also championed traditional values to voters who feared government-led social change.Â Â  But both of these strategies may have been played out. Weâve been fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq for close to a decade now, and itâs hard to see how voters are going to get excited about spending more money on the military.Â  Our continuing economic travails made it easy to discredit health care reform as a distraction, and the same thing will be true of any values-laden campaign. If they want to maintain their momentum, Republicans must never look as if they are ignoring the elephant in the room. The Republican Partyâs best chance, then, is to offer a Reagan-like promise of economic renewal. During the election campaign, Citizens Against Government Waste ran a powerful ad showing Chinese students chortling over the decline and fall of the American empire.Â Â  Intellectually, I am disturbed by any attempt to stir up anti-Chinese feelings; Chinaâs economic growth is likely to benefit the whole world, and America has freely taken advantage of the Chinese willingness to lend us trillions. But emotionally, I understand the power of a campaign that reminds Americans of our past glories and scares us with thoughts of future decline.Â Â  As an economist, I see great good in the growth of the Asian powers and I dislike any appeal to nationalism.Â Â  But as an American, I certainly sense the strength of such nationalistic appeals.Â  I, too, want to leave my children a stronger nation. How can Republicans credibly promote a strategy of national strength? Our military is already strong.Â Â  Itâs our economy that needs tending.Â Â  In the 1980s, President Reagan could argue that the economy would grow if taxes and regulations were cut.Â Â  The 1970s had very high marginal tax rates and plenty of unnecessary regulations (some were cut under President Carter, like those that limited airline competition).Â  But today our tax rates are already low, and no one has come up with any great candidates for regulatory reform. In the 19th century, Whigs promised natural greatness with investments in physical infrastructure â internal improvements â and decades later President Eisenhower echoed that strategy with his highway system. But that strategy is unlikely to work for the Republican Party today.Â Â  It is far from obvious that new roads or rail systems will do much good for economic output growth, and the Democratic Party already has established credibility as the champion of public infrastructure spending. Indeed, the Republican Party may be right to attack many such projects as pork barrel politics that miss the source of economic strength in the 21st century. Today, human â not physical â capital determines economic success.Â Â  If we want to make sure that our children are wealthier than the Chinese, we will have to make sure that they are better educated.Â Â  If Republicans really want to become the party of long-run economic success, they will also need to become the party of human capital: the leaders who understand that we will stay a great nation not by providing a more generous safety net for the elderly but by investing more in our young. Schools are the 21st centuryâs arsenal of democracy â they are the technology that will make America strong.Â  For the Republican Party to offer a powerful alternative vision, it must embrace both economic freedom and education â the two ingredients of sustainable economic success around the world today.
