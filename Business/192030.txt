Negotiating the price of a car can be a painful process, a game of cat and mouse between you and the salesman. Several companies offer programs to negotiate a price before going into the car dealership, including Consumer Reports and USAA, the insurer. On Tuesday, American Express will announce that it has added its own auto program for its wealthiest customers. Holders of  the Centurion Card, more commonly known as the black card, will be able to negotiate the price of a car through the Centurion Web site, and they will have the added benefit of being able to do so without having to reveal any personal information. In addition, on certain cars, they will get added perks. Tesla, for instance, is offering a media upgrade package, and Jaguar has added financial incentives. Beyond offering help in negotiating the price of a car, the Centurion auto program has two other perks. Customers can get access to luxury rentals — a Ferrari for the weekend, for example — as well as driving experiences on Formula 1 racing courses. Desiree Fish, vice president of public affairs for American Express, said the program was an addition to luxury perks it offers Centurion members in fashion, food, wine and travel. She declined to say how many people hold the card. The company is starting the program to tap into what she said is an increase in spending among its wealthiest clients. âThe economy is starting to pick up so there is more of an interest now in people out there spending,â Ms. Fish said. âAuto is something we havenât done before. We wanted to do something robust.â While holders of the black card will officially be told about the program on Tuesday, Ms. Fish said the auto page has been public (though buried on the site) to test the technology. âFive cars have been sold already in the last two weeks,â she said. âTheyâve found this info on their own, no marketing or promoting.â Apparently, even people buying a Jaguar are looking for a deal.
