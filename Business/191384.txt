 China said it would permit banks to set their own exchange rates for the renminbi against the dollar in deals with clients, in a step to relax controls to make the currency more market-driven. Chinese officials have pledged to loosen interest rates and currency controls eventually to help put its economy, the second largest in the world, on a more sustainable footing, but such changes have so far been gradual.

From there, the spot rate may fluctuate in either direction by only 2 percent.
