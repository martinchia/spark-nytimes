For some business owners, using Groupon-style discounts can bring disastrous results. For others, deal-of-the-day Web sites can deliver a welcome boost to business. But for ABC Language Exchange in New York, they did both. The school, which offers group and private lessons in an array of languages, has used Groupon or similar services on five occasions. On balance, Elizabeth Lunney, co-founder and chief executive, has been pleased. But one bad experience taught her that planning for each promotion requires almost military precision. She also figured out that the sites were willing to negotiate key aspects of their deals. In February 2010, after getting a sales call from Lifebooker, a daily-deal site that primarily offers bargains on beauty services, Ms. Lunney agreed to run her first daily-deal promotion. ABC, which employs five full-time workers and four part-timers, didnât prepare for the deal. The Lifebooker users were offered half-price classes in any language, at any level, and at any time.  Fulfilling ABCâs obligations to the 85 people who signed up, Ms. Lunney said, was âkind of awkward.â She hadnât considered whether the school would actually have classes in the studentsâ desired languages, and at the levels and times the discount buyers wanted. But with some extra effort, ABC managed to enroll all 85 people. Luckily, Ms. Lunney said, they did not all call at once. Pleased with the boost in business, Ms. Lunney suggested that the director of ABCâs Washington outpost try something similar. Lifebooker, which operates only in New York and Los Angeles, wasnât an option. So the director who ran the Washington office used Groupon. The deal went live in March 2010 — again with no preparation by ABC. âThe phones were ringing off the hook,â Ms. Lunney said. The director struggled to evaluate, place and enroll the 380 people who signed up. She devised an online class request form. But the would-be students mistook it for an enrollment form. People started showing up for classes that didnât exist. And they werenât happy. âIt was a customer service nightmare — our director got completely smothered and verbally abused,â Ms. Lunney said. Burned out by the experience, the director decided to resign, and Ms. Lunney chose not to replace her. Instead, ABC wound down the Washington business and closed the office, which had operated for about a year. Ultimately, ABC managed to place most of the Groupon users in classes, sometimes offering private lessons when groups werenât available. But the Washington office took a loss on the deal. That experience taught Ms. Lunney to anticipate big volume and devise a system to handle it. For starters, she asks each deal site about its list size to get a sense of how many responses to expect. Having offered discounts through several daily-deal sites, Ms. Lunney has concluded that the only thing that truly differentiates them is the size of their lists. She also tried to review the deal-redemption process from the customerâs perspective.Â When she tried Groupon again in New York, she limited the deal to the six most popular languages and to beginner classes, which require no student evaluations. She worked with her technology team to ensure that Groupon users could sign up online, reducing the need for phone calls. On the ABC Web site, she added a gift card payment option (previously, a credit card was required). Ms. Lunney also drafted âGroupon F.A.Q.’sâ that painstakingly explained the dealâs terms. She posted them conspicuously on herÂ  site and said they helped limit confused phone calls. The deal ran in May 2010 and drew 580 Groupon users. A third of them signed up within the first three days. There were only 50 phone calls. With the new processes established, ABC smoothly handled promotions with Lifebooker last August, and with TheDealist last December, which Ms. Lunney says she believes would otherwise have been a slow month. âI think these deals made our year,â she said. The company, she added, had 2010 revenue of about $1.1 million and just had its best January. The daily-deal sites work well for ABC because the school can fill seats with bargain-hunters without spending more to handle them. Group class sizes range from four to nine students, and teachers receive the same pay regardless of the number. For ABC, a large group, even at half price, is a win. Ms. Lunney estimates that 25 to 35 percent of ABCâs daily-deal students return and pay full price. However, she said, given its small staff, the school lacks the resources to track the numbers precisely. For ABC, high-impact marketing is the real value of any deal. The deals deliver new customers who provide testimonials, she said, which is “better than just having your name splashed around.â Although it took Ms. Lunney a few tries to devise efficient procedures, she did one thing that worked from the start: she resisted the standard 50 percent cut for businesses. She always bargains, often securing percentages of 60 to 70 percent for ABC. She once set terms that gave ABC an 80 percent cut if coupon redeemers exceeded a certain number, and 75 percent if they didnât. (A Groupon representative said exceptions to its standard 50/50 fee split were rare.) Ms Lunney says she believes the sites were willing to negotiate with her because of the novelty of ABC’s services and because of the relatively high cash value of her coupon offers — about $140. The deal sites are only as strong as the products they sell, she said, which improves ABC’s bargaining position. To bring in $140, a deal site would have to sell a lot of coupons for, say, cupcakes or manicures. âAt the end of the day,” she said, “itâs about dollars, not percentages.” You can follow Adriana Gardella on Twitter.
