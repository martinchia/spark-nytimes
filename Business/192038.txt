As the American International Group continues to rebuild itself — and prepares to begin shedding the government’s massive ownership stake — a former executive says he is betting on the insurer again. In an op-ed on Politico, Ron Shelp, a former top communications officer for the company, writes that even after losing $2.5 million on paper after A.I.G.’s stock collapsed in 2008, he will be among the first in line to buy shares when the company effectively takes itself public this year. From the op-ed: Today, A.I.G. has a solid strategy. It has restructured, with two core businesses â Chartis, its property and casualty arm, and SunAmerica, the domestic life company which also offers retirement products. Chartis remains the largest property-casualty insurer in the world. The markets recognize this turnaround. In November, A.I.G. held its first bond offering since the crisis, and raised $2 billion. More recently, a consortium of banks granted A.I.G. a $3 billion credit line, replacing the government credit line. So when the A.I.G. shares go on the block, I will be there. Even with the pain of losing hundreds of thousands of dollars still fresh in my mind. Advertisement
