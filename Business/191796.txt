In December Congress voted to temporarily slash payroll taxes, in an effort to give consumers more pocket money to go out and stimulate the economy. So far the tax break has indeed put more money in consumers’ wallets, but early evidence indicates that it hasn’t yet been enough to increase spending. Starting in January, American workers’ withholding for Social Security payroll taxes dropped from 6.2 to 4.2 percent. We got a sneak peek of the results in today’s Commerce Department report, which showed that the tax break helped raise household incomes by the largest amount in nearly two years in January: 1 percent, compared to a 0.4 percent increase in December. Adjusting for price changes, disposable income — that is, how much money consumers have available after taxes — rose 0.4 percent, compared with a rise of 0.1 percent in December. Unfortunately for the economy, consumer spending, when adjusted for inflation, went in the opposite direction: Personal consumption fell 0.1 percent in January after having increased 0.2 percent in December. Rising prices were to blame for the decline. No wonder economists are worried about what a continued rise in energy prices might do to the economy. “Higher food and gasoline prices are swallowing up a larger proportion of  the household budgets and making consumers feel that they should save more and spend less,” Chris G. Christopher Jr., an economist at IHS Global Insight, wrote in a note to clients today.
