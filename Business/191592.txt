Federal prosecutors are seeking to reverse, or at least narrow, a crucial insider trading ruling that overturned the convictions of two hedge fund managers last month, DealBookâs Matthew Goldstein and Ben Protess report. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, is asking the same three-judge panel that issued the ruling to revisit its decision, according to a filing on Friday. As an alternative, Mr. Bhararaâs filing proposes the legal equivalent of a do-over in a process known as en banc. Both requests âcould be long shots,â Mr. Goldstein and Mr. Protess write, but the requests may âlay the groundwork for an appeal to the United States Supreme Court.â The outcome is critical for Mr. Bharara, whose office has won more than 80 convictions from his campaign against insider trading on Wall Street. Mr. Bhararaâs decision to appeal will also help shape the boundaries of insider trading law for decades to come. The three-judge panel had ruled that the judge who presided over the 2012 trial of Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson set too low a bar for conviction when instructing jurors. The panelâs ruling has also threatened a number of Mr. Bhararaâs other insider trading convictions, including that of Michael Steinberg, a onetime rainmaker at the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors.  MARKETS SHAKE OFF GREEK ELECTION  |  Financial markets on Monday shrugged off the result of Greek parliamentary elections, which handed a decisive victory to the left-wing Syriza party on Sunday, David Jolly and Neil Gough write in The New York Times. Syriza and its outspoken leader, Alexis Tsipras, who had campaigned against the austerity measures imposed on Greece by its international creditors, formed a coalition government on Monday with a right-wing fringe party, Independent Greeks. The Euro Stoxx 50 index was up slightly in late morning trading on Monday, while the FTSE 100 index in London was down 0.4 percent. The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.1241, after briefly dipping to as low as $1.1098, its lowest levels since 2003. The main stock index in Athens, which initially fell more than 3.5 percent on Monday, recovered somewhat and was down about 1 percent in late morning trading. Major indexes in Tokyo fell about 0.3 percent, and Hong Kong shares rose by a similar amount. Spanish and Italian bond yields fell to near-record lows, below 1.5 percent. Trading in Standard & Poorâs 500 index futures indicated that stocks would be little changed at the opening bell in New York.  OBSCURE LAW HAS ITS DAY  |  The recent restructuring of two companies â Caesars Entertainment and Education Management Corporation â has turned an obscure law from the 1930s into something that is becoming sexy, Gretchen Morgenson writes in the Fair Game column. The law, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, was intended to prevent back-room deals that stripped bondholders of their rights and states that debt holdersâ rights to receive interest and principal payments âshall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such holder.â In the face of the restructurings, Caesars and Education Management removed guarantees of the parent company on debt payments. That these two recent cases invoke this aspect of the law may change the way debt restructurings are handled, a professor at Harvard Law School said. âOne thing we can all agree on is that itâs not normally in the public interest to have somebody behind a curtain pulling the strings on these transactions,â an expert in securities law said.

Schools will be open on Monday but will probably close on Tuesday, Mr. de Blasio said. Hot chocolate, anyone?  2 REINSURERS TO MERGE  |  The big insurance companies PartnerRe and Axis Capital Holdings, both based in Bermuda, agreed on Sunday to merge, creating a new reinsurer with a combined market capitalization of nearly $11 billion, DealBookâs Michael J. de la Merced writes. The merger comes as such companies have been looking to consolidate to help compete against new entrants in the industry. Together, PartnerRe and Axis will have more than $7 billion in combined gross premiums written and over $14 billion in capital, and will also have a specialty insurance arm with $2.5 billion in gross premiums. Under the terms of the deal â billed as a so-called merger of equals â investors in PartnerRe will receive 2.18 shares in the newly combined company for each share that they own, while shareholders in Axis will receive one share of the new firm for each share in the existing reinsurer that they already have. Current PartnerRe stockholders will own 51.6 percent of the new company, while those in Axis will own 48.4 percent.    |  Contact: @melbournecoal | E-mail  Aer Lingus Considering Revised Takeover Bid From British Airways Parent  |  The Irish carrier had previously rejected two recent takeover offers from the International Consolidated Airlines Group, which is now offering to pay 2.55 euros a share for the airline, or about $2.86, up from its offer of â¬2.40 a share in December.
