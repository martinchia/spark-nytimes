The struggles of a business trying to survive. I would like to thank everyone who took time to offer guidance as I addressed my pricing problems. As usual, I received a range of answers after I asked whether it is a good idea to mess with a system that is, on aggregate, producing numbers that allow us to make a profit, but that on closer inspection is not working very well. Letâs start with a warning, from George from Florida: ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND???…If your pricing is making you money like never before then DON”T FIX IT. Thanks, George. I would definitely follow your advice if I were confident that our pricing model was responsible for the profits, as opposed to the changes we made in manufacturing or just a run of good luck — and if I were confident that I could continue with my current pricing models forever. But I suspect that we will continue to grow and that my problem will get worse in ways that I wonât like. So I have come to the conclusion that I simply have to come up with models that correlate better with what is happening in the rest of the business. From Dinos Gonatas: … over the next couple months try adjusting your prices higher or lower by 5 – 10% on various bids â¦ THEN see if the different prices led to a lot more bid wins or losses.  This would be great if all of the tables we sell, and all of the customers we sell to, were similar enough that we could isolate the pricing variable and look to see what happens as we change it. Unfortunately, we donât have enough transactions to do this. Furthermore, we rarely sell the same table twice. And we have lots of different kinds of customers. Add all of that together and you get a situation where comparisons are hard to make. From Bos: Paul, based on your description, your company is in that awkward position not small or big enough. You nailed it. A number of other commenters recommended that I bring in outside help — interns or Wharton students or professional software developers — to fix my issue. I may well call for help in the future, but right now I intend to dig into the problem myself. And weâre small enough that this is feasible: $2.6 million in sales, 17 employees. I still have an excellent grasp of what every person in my shop is doing all day, and I have a thorough understanding of where all of our information is stored, how we use it and how I want to change it. If we were a much larger company, the boss would not be expected to know, or need to know, everything that I know. I am starting to see this happen to me. We now have a few machines that I do not know how to operate, and Iâm not monitoring my sales team every minute of the day anymore. Maybe in a few years Iâll have replaced myself with a general manager, and I won’t really concern myself with daily events at all. But not yet. I like a challenge, and figuring this out is a challenge. From Urs-Peter: I recommend that you first think about all the data you need to come up with a price.  From Al: You don’t have a pricing problem….You have a data problem. It sounds like you need to address the issues of labor tracking, material purchase/use, and material prices.  I have come to the same conclusion. In fact, since I started messing with the pricing spreadsheets, I have arrived at a much broader understanding of what is wrong. At root, we have a mismatch between the data we have been collecting, our operations on the shop floor, the way the sales team operates and the prices we charge. I didnât get to this higher plane of knowledge instantly. It took several months. And during that time I was reaching out to whoever I thought might help. I needed to deepen my knowledge in two ways: one focused on the minutiae of writing Excel and Filemaker code and the other on finding a conceptual framework for thinking about how data collection and pricing fit into our entire operation. It was a lunch with Bob Zeigenfuse of Avanceon, a company that designs factory-automation systems, that brought it all together for me. We were out on the shop floor looking at the arrangement, or nonarrangement, of my various machines. They have been placed here and there as we bought them, without any overall plan. He recommended that we move things around to form work cells to reflect the different steps we take in making a table, and that our data collection should concentrate on what each cell is doing. Light-bulb moment! I suddenly saw how I could align the pricing spreadsheet with what is happening on the shop floor, by changing the way we record what each person is working on all day. We do that in our custom Filemaker database, which was written by a former employee, Sasha, who had defined a list of possible labor classifications back in 2007, when she wrote the package. On her own, Sasha came up with an astonishingly capable piece of software. She had worked for me for six years at that point and had a very good understanding of how we did business. Her work reflects that knowledge. We used her software to write contracts, manage customer relations, buy materials and track our shop operations. Iâve shown her work to several Filemaker guys, and after a thorough examination they all wanted Sashaâs contact information so they could hire her. Of course, Sashaâs labor classifications reflected our shop floor circa 2008. She came up with 51 ways of classifying labor time, grouped in six task categories: Office, Build Top, Build Base, Build General, Finish and Other. The list is too short, and the subcategories they contain are too broad, so that I can never get enough information out of our past results to write good algorithms to predict the future. I realized that we need a lot more choices than she provided. Sashaâs creation is a mansion with many rooms. There are hundreds of layouts, thousands of data cells. Over the last few years I have spent a great deal of time exploring what is there and what is not there. I have taught myself a fair amount of Filemaker in the process.  I can hear some readers right now saying that I have no business doing this, that I should just hire a developer. Iâve looked into doing that, and I have come to believe that I need to understand how it works before I ask someone else to mess with it. Otherwise, I donât think I can give good directions as to what should be changed. Iâm glad I have taken the time to learn some Filemaker, because now I find that I can make many small changes myself, instantly, for no money. I know where the labor categories are stored — in a special admin screen that Sasha wrote to administer those choices. At the top of that layout, Sasha left this urgent warning: âDo not mess with these unless you are very, very sure that you know what you are doing.â Hmmm. That kept me from making changes for many years, but I recently decided to take the gamble. I backed up the program and dived in. A week later, I had expanded the number of top-level categories from six to 10 and the number of labor choices from 51 to 216 — after consulting with my workers to see what they are really doing all day and then writing labor choices that reflect the actual tasks. I tested my changes and found no negative effects. Now the data look like the arrangement of the shop floor. I spent considerable time explaining these changes to all of the workers, emphasizing that we will need to spend more time collecting data, and that itâs O.K., because better data will help us make more money. And I designed a set of data-collection sheets to standardize how people take note of what they do all day. We had never done this before — everyone just recorded their hours however they wanted. Iâm hoping that all of these changes will generate good operational data and that Iâll be able to use that to check my algorithms as I complete the pricing spreadsheet. PaulSF: Look at the phrase you closed with: “roll the dice.” Is that how you want to run your business? Small businesses are, inherently, rolls of the dice. Iâve been chucking the bones for 28 years now. Still here, still kicking. If I had the choice, would I remove risk from my existence? I donât know. It keeps things interesting.
