LONDON â Kweku M. Adoboli, the former UBS trader charged with fraud, had his case referred to a higher court Thursday as the prosecution revealed more details about how the Swiss bank discovered a $2.3 billion trading loss. Mr. Adoboliâs lawyers did not enter a plea, and the case was passed on to Southwark Crown Court, a major London court that handles serious fraud cases, for a Nov. 22 hearing. Mr. Adoboli attended the court hearing in the same gray suit and dark blue tie he wore at his last court appearance a month ago. Smiling briefly to the visitorsâ gallery, where about five family members and a handful of his friends had gathered, he only spoke to confirm his name, birth date and address. Mr. Adoboli, 31, stood behind a glass wall nervously pressing his lips together as the four charges – two counts of false accounting and two of fraud â were read. The prosecutor, David Williams, said there was no application for bail but that in any case the government had concerns that Mr. Adoboli might interfere with witnesses given his close connection to former colleagues. Mr. Williams also said Mr. Adoboli was now in debt.  UBS has been dealing with the fallout from the trading scandal. It has prompted the resignation of the chief executive, Oswald J. GrÃ¼bel, and the departure of the co-heads of equities. Another eight people in that division were suspended in connection with the case. UBS is close to completing its own internal investigation into the trades and a separate investigation is under way by KPMG, which is working on behalf of the Swiss and British financial regulators. Mr. Williams described to the court on Thursday the days leading up to Mr. Adoboliâs arrest. He said that Mr. Adoboli was first questioned about his trades by one of his managers in August and then again on Sept. 13, when he was also asked whether he had contacted the credit risk department. Mr. Adoboli said he had not, the prosecutor said, and the next day was asked to identify the counterparties of his trades. Mr. Adoboli did not respond to that request and left the office to go to his apartment around lunchtime, the prosecutor said. From there, Mr Adoboli sent an e-mail with some details about his trades to his managers, who then called him back to the office, according to the prosecutor. At 3.45 p.m. on Sept. 14, Mr. Adoboli returned to UBS and âcooperated with bank managers in identifying the trading positions,â the prosecutor said. At 3.30 a.m. the following day, UBS called the police and Mr. Adoboli was arrested shortly afterward at the bank. Advertisement
