Financial regulators have long relied on outsiders to generate tips about potential fraud at hedge funds: disgruntled employees, news reports and disillusioned investors. Now, the Securities and Exchange Commission is ferreting out wrongdoing in a new way — and it’s bearing fruit.  On Thursday, a new âanalyticsâ division tasked with mining hedge fund data announced actions against six individuals and three hedge fund firms for alleged fraud.  âWeâre using risk analytics and unconventional methods to help achieve the holy grail of securities law enforcement â earlier detection and prevention,â said Robert Khuzami, director of the S.E.C.âs Division of Enforcement. âThis approach, especially in the absence of a tip or complaint, minimizes both the number of victims and the amount of loss while increasing the chance of recovering funds and charging the perpetrators.â For the last year, law enforcement types have been focused on the Dodd Frank whistle-blower act, which financially compensates employees who speak out about fraud and wrongdoing at their companies. Less well-known has been the agencyâs internal efforts, which signals a new front in the regulator’s battle to police the once-secretive world of hedge funds. Mr. Khuzami spoke earlier this year about the new initiative, which he said would focus on hedge funds and other asset managers whose performance consistently beat peers and the markets. Regulators filed actions against Michael Balboa for allegedly overvaluing the returns and assets of his hedge fund, which at the peak managed about $844 million. By inflating the numbers, the regulators say, Mr. Balboa made millions in fees and was able to raise additional money from investors. The case has also prompted criminal charges against Mr. Balboa. The S.E.C. accused another hedge fund, ThinkStrategy Capital Management, and its managing director, Chetan Kapur, of manipulating figures to inflate the returns, size and other aspects of two hedge funds. The firm oversaw about $520 million in 2008. Mr. Kapur settled the case and agreed to pay penalties that a federal court will determine. Earlier this month, the agency filed an action against Patrick Rooney and his company, Solaris Management, alleging that the manager misused customer money. In addition, investigators pursued an administrative proceeding against LeadDog Capital Markets and its owners Chris Messalas and Joseph LaRocco for keeping investors in the dark about past regulatory infractions and conflicts of interest, among other things.
