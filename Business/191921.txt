 John Faraci, International Paper CEO discusses demand and its role in job growth. 7:41 p.m. | Updated  After a standoff that has lasted for months, International Paper announced on Tuesday that it had reached a agreement to acquire Temple-Inland with an increased offer of $3.7 billion. International Paper, the worldâs biggest paper and forest products company, clinched the deal after raising its offer by 5 percent, to $32 a share in cash from $30.60 in cash. Timothy S. Nicholls, International Paperâs chief financial officer, said in an interview that the two companies began talking last week about a potential sale. Discussions quickly escalated, and the two sides concluded negotiations this weekend. âWe had finally reached a point where we were able to hold talks,â he said. The speed of the turnabout took some by surprise. A drawn-out takeover battle had appeared to be in the cards after International Paper announced an unsolicited bid on June 6. Temple-Inlandâs board spurned the offer and quickly adopted a shareholdersâ rights plan, or poison pill, while International Paper took its offer directly to Temple-Inlandâs shareholders. Analysts at Citigroup said that while they expected the two companies to come to terms eventually, âwe didnât expect it to happen until lateâ in the fourth quarter or early first quarter. The deal came together even as two clouds emerged over Temple-Inland, a maker of corrugated packaging. Last month, the company acknowledged that a paper mill in Bogalusa, La., had discharged chemicals into the Pearl River, killing a large number of fish. Days later, Temple-Inland was accused in a lawsuit of helping cause the failure of a Texas bank it had owned before spinning it off in 2007. In a conference call on Tuesday, John Faraci, the chief executive of International Paper, said the company did due diligence on both issues and âmade accommodations for those in our valuation.â International Paper said it would also assume $600 million of Temple-Inlandâs debt as part of the deal. Mr. Nicholls emphasized that even at the higher $32-a-share price, the deal promised millions of dollars in cost savings. Much of those are expected to come from combining the two companiesâ supply chains and mill operations. He added that International Paper expects layoffs as well, though he said that the company had not decided on a precise figure. With the economy relatively stagnant, he added, it made sense to gain scale by meshing the two together. âWe recognize that weâre in a slow-growth period,â he said. âBut combining these two businesses makes a lot of sense.â International Paper has said that it has committed financing from one of its financial advisers, UBS. It is also receiving advice from Evercore Partners and the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton. Temple-Inland is being advised by Goldman Sachs and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Advertisement
