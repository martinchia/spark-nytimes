UBS strikes back. Two weeks after Citigroup announced that it had hired two investment bankers from the struggling Swiss bank, UBS said on Tuesday that it had poached two top Citi officials for its technology group.  Doug Brengel, who has been at Citi and its predecessor Salomon Brothers for more than 30 years, will join UBS as the chairman of technology banking. UBS also hired Bill Frauenhofer as a managing director in the technology group.  Earlier this month, UBS named a Deutsche Bank official, Yusuf Nahmiyas, as a managing director for its technology, media and telecommunications mergers team.  The crucial hires come as UBS scrambles to restaff the ranks of its technology group, after losing several top employees to rival banks. UBS has faced a series of prominent defections as it struggles to compete with other big banks that are better positioned to offer lavish compensation packages. John Metz, the head of communications banking within the firmâs technology group, left the Swiss bank in April to join Credit Suisse. The firm also lost Eric Mandl, a tech specialist, to Evercore Partners. Citi said this month that it had nabbed James Glerum, the co-head of UBSâs Midwestern operations and its head of diversified industrials, and Cary Kochman, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at UBS. After the string of departures, UBS has finally managed to lure away some rival bankers.  Mr. Brengel will join UBS after spending the bulk of his career at Citi and Salomon Brothers, where he founded the firm’s global technology group in 1992. He joined the firm in 1977.  “Doug brings a wealth of relationships, a global perspective, and a long history of successful transactions to our technology practice,” UBS said in an announcement on Wednesday.  Mr. Frauenhofer, a managing director at Citi, will focus primarily on semiconductor and capital equipment companies for UBS.   Both men will join UBS in late August.  Advertisement
