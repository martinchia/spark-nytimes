Last week was an eventful one for the Las Vegas gambler William T. Walters. The week began with one of the three golf courses Mr. Walters owns in Las Vegas announcing that it would once again be host to the âworldâs sexiest golf tournamentâ in August. The week ended with front-page stories in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reporting that Mr. Walters was in the middle of an insider trading investigation involving the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn and the championship golfer Phil Mickelson. Itâs not clear where the insider trading investigation, opened two years ago by federal authorities, is heading. So far, no one has been charged with any wrongdoing and the investigation would appear to face a significant number of legal hurdles. Mr. Icahn and Mr. Mickelson have said they did nothing wrong. Mr. Walters — known as Billy and one the most famous sports gamblers in Las Vegas — issued a statement on Monday, in which he said, “I am innocent of doing anything wrong. It’s that simple.” In the statement, Mr. Walters added: “I’m not involved in any insider trading. I’ve never been involved in any insider trading.” The investigation, in the near term, is likely to draw more attention to Mr. Waltersâs businesses outside of the world of gambling, such as his golf courses. The May 25 news release promoting the return of the âworldâs sexiest golf tournamentâ is one of those only-in-Vegas stories that is likely to generate interest, if for no other reason than the continuing trading inquiry. Now in its fourth year, the tournament is officially known as the Las Vegas ParAm and will be hosted at Bali Hai Golf Club. But the tournamentâs calling card isnât the well-manicured greens at the club, but the “extremely attractive” caddies, called ParMates, who accompany groups of golfers around the course. The female ParMates are professional models âwho are known for enhancing a round of golf by being fun and sexy,ââ according the release from Mr. Waltersâs company. The ParMates, who have been featured in an article in Golf Digest and video segment on the Golf Channel, have their own webpage and Twitter feed. The site for the ParMates looks more like a upscale dating service than one for caddy bookings. The site includes a gallery of photos for more than three dozen women, highlighting their heights, measurements and âguilty pleasures.â There is even a ParMate of the Month section on the website. But golfers visiting Las Vegas don’t need to participate in the ParAm tournament to spend some time on the links with one of Mr. Waltersâs ParMates. The website says that golfers can reserve caddie time with ParMates year round with 72 hours’ notice. Advertisement
