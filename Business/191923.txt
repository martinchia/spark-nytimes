Bank of America‘s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, who has been under fire for his bankâs dismal performance, has agreed to field questions from investors on Wednesday.  The recent slide in the bank’s stock price is sure to focus investors’ attention on the conference call. Even with Tuesday’s bounce —  Bank of America shares are up nearly 8 percent in midday trading — the shares are down more than 47 percent for the year to date. And Mr. Moynihan has been reassuring bank employees rattled by the stock sell-off. Skeptics will be welcome on Wednesday’s conference call, says  Bruce Berkowitz, founder of Fairholme Capital Management, which owns more than 92 million shares of Bank of America and is hosting the hour-and-a-half conference call.  Mr. Berkowitz will ask Mr. Moynihan “the toughest questions” submitted to askbrian@fairhomefunds.com before opening the call up, the firm said in a statement.  DealBook talked to a number of analysts and investors and asked them what questions should be posed to the Bank of America chief executive. Here are the top six: 1. Brian, what is the tab on this mortgage mess going to be?  In the second quarter, Bank of America set aside $14 billion to settle some big claims.  Call us crazy, but we were hopeful that that might be it. Now we see American International Group is suing Bank of America. That is big. What do you think the ultimate tab might be?   2. There has been a lot of chatter about Bank of America selling assets to raise capital, although some analysts and regulators have seen no need for you to do so.  What sort of stuff is the bank looking at unloading and have there been internal discussions about spinning off Merrill Lynch?
 3. You are one of first big financial executives to speak publicly since the debt downgrade on Friday.  Do you think it was justified and how will it and all the turmoil effect Bank of Americaâs business?  4. Your credit default swap spreads  widened sharply in recent days, if narrowing on Tuesday, indicating that investors are worried about the bank’s health.  What do you plan to do to restore confidence and how certain are you you wonât have to raise capital again?  5. You have a very tough job.  Do you plan to stick around and has the board voiced any concerns to you about your stewardship?  6. Why did you agree to participate on this call?   We know the party line; it is good to talk to investors and all that.  But it also a risky move in this type of environment and some investors have told us it raises questions about other actions you may be taking.  I guess you are damned if do, and damned if you donât.  But we are curious why on earth are you talking to us?
