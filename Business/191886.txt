The hunt for wireless patents may be fiercer than ever, as Google‘s $12.5 billion deal for Motorola Mobility shows.  But not all intellectual property is created equally. And if Jefferies is right, Research in Motion won’t reap more than about $1 billion if it seeks to sell off its patent portfolio while continuing to make BlackBerrys. Jefferies’s Peter Misek wrote in a research note published on Wednesday that a deep dive into R.I.M.’s portfolio shows that the collection of wireless patents has a liquidation value of about $2.5 billion. That is, if the company decided to sell itself entirely.  But if R.I.M. wants to continue making its own handsets, it would need to strike cross-licensing deals with any eventual buyers. That would more than halve the value of the portfolio, to about $1 billion. In other words, don’t expect to see a RIM patent sale anytime soon. Mr. Misek also lowered his target price for the company to a “salvage value” of $21.  Shares in RIM fell 3.3 percent to $21.96 in midmorning trading on Wednesday. They have fallen more than 53 percent in the last 12 months. Advertisement
