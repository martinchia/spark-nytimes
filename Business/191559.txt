5:43 p.m. | Updated  After months of trying, Brocade Communications Systems may be making some headway on a potential sale of itself. And that has apparently given investors in the networking hardware company some hope. The company has held talks with a number of private equity firms that have expressed interest in a possible deal, people briefed on the matter said. These people spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks were in an early stage and might not lead to a transaction. Brocade has been working with Qatalyst Partners, the boutique investment bank run by Frank P. Quattrone, for the past several months, these people said. The news of the talks, first reported on Monday by Reuters, pushed Brocade’s shares up as much as 10 percent in midday trading. The stock later drifted downward, closing at $5.77. Part of the reason for investors’ caution may be Brocade’s own history of failed sales talks. The company previously tried to sell itself to Hewlett-Packard and other big technology companies, but the negotiations foundered. And at least one of the private equity firms is taking a meeting with Brocade advisers despite reservations that the company’s current stock price makes any deal overvalued, one of the people briefed on the matter said. A spokesman for Brocade declined to comment. Advertisement
