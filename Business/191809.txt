7:26 p.m. | Updated  Harvey Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, criticized the Dodd-Frank Act on Tuesday, saying the financial regulatory overhaul would fall short of its goal of protecting investors from future financial crises . The law âunfortunately did not provide the regulatory reform that our financial and capital markets, and those who invest, so urgently needed and still require,â Mr. Pitt, who was chairman of the S.E.C. from 2001 to 2003, said in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. âThe act is unduly complex, adds more layers of regulatory bureaucracy to an already overbloated bureaucracy, makes financial regulation more cumbersome and less nimble than it already was,â said Mr. Pitt, now the chief of Kalorama Partners, a Washington consulting firm. Nearly a year after President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law, the banking committee on Tuesday examined the lawâs efforts to protect investors. The act dedicated an entire section to âinvestor protections,â creating an Office of Investor Advocate, enhancing regulation of credit rating agencies and reining in executive pay. But some of the corporate governance rules âfavor certain special interests at the expense of rank-and-file shareholders,â Mr. Pitt said. He also objected to a new corporate whistle-blower program, created under the act. In April, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a program that rewards employees who report crucial information about fraud and other wrongdoing. Under the rules, whistle-blowers are not required to report fraud internally before going to the government. âThis provision threatens to undermine corporate governance, internal compliance and the confidence of public investors in our heavily regulated capital markets,â said Mr. Pitt, a Republican who was appointed to run the S.E.C. by President George W. Bush. Mr. Pitt issued some support for expanding the S.E.C.âs authority to examine thousands of investment advisers. But he said the agency lacked the budget to fully take on its new responsibilities. His comments on the agencyâs budget echo concerns raised by consumer advocates, who have long called for the S.E.C. to receive a budget increase. âWhile we are sympathetic to those who argue that money alone cannot solve all of the agencyâs problems, we also believe that, without additional funding, the agency cannot reasonably be expected to effectively fulfill its investor protection mission,â Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America, told the committee.
