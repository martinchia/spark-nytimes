An old-line business tries to compete in a high-tech economy. In a previous post, I offered a preliminary post-mortem in which I talked about some of the things we learned from our nearly disastrous handling of one customerâs order. In this post, I want to wrap up this series of posts by talking about how my thinking about my own role at the company has changed. When I bought Finishing Technology, I had already started and managed a small portfolio of rental properties. It was small enough that I could control every aspect of it and solve all of its problems personally. I was the âheroâ who knew all and could make all problems go away, and I developed a strongly directive management style: I told people what to do. Because we were successful, I never thought to question my management approach. I considered myself a salesman and had never thought of management as a science or art. Maybe it’s because management can be overwhelming, or maybe I just preferred selling. In any case, I have to say itâs a bit embarrassing to describe how much I learned from this recent parts incident, because it makes clear how much I have left to learn. But here goes.  First, I confess: In the past, I have enjoyed playing the hero who saves the day. But if I learned any lesson from this, itâs that those days are over. And yet, Iâm still having a hard time letting go. Why should it be so hard? Do we really have to go from crisis to crisis? In recent days Iâve reflected on those questions a great deal. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that being the hero is exhausting. Yes, itâs energizing for a while, but it just drains too much energy, and I noticed it was making me cynical, causing me to ask far too often and with a lot of frustration, âWhy am I the one who always has to figure this out?â Thatâs not good. Not for me, not for anyone else, not for the business. The solution is twofold. First, I have to break the habit of stepping in and sorting things out. And thatâs exactly what it is: a habit, one that became my de facto approach to management. I didnât realize it at the time, but Iâve learned to manage by fighting fires. More important and more difficult, I have to figure out what I will do instead of stepping in and taking charge. My recent experience with the parts showed me that I also enjoy watching others grow and learn. That was satisfying and energizing for me. I recognize that I was still the catalyst for figuring out the process and for leading the fire-fighting brigade, but I also found that I could sit and do my work in the operations room and not be on the front lines. When I sat down, others were more likely to step up. Duh. I know. Itâs obvious in hindsight. Obvious, and yet I can still come up with all sorts of reasons why I should be the guy who makes things happen. I have the most experience, the most training, and my brain just naturally seems to run through alternative ways to do things. As I sorted through all of the reasons I should keep taking charge, I realized they are also the very same reasons the company hit a wall. As you may recall, it was the expectation that I would step in and take charge that led my team to allow 50 days to pass without anyone stepping up and pointing out that we were in danger of blowing a deadline. The more I thought about it, the more I came to understand that my reasons were really just rationalizations in disguise. Why do I need rationalizations? Probably to cover up some uncomfortable truths. One uncomfortable truth is that I have to change the way I manage and thatâs a bit scary. This is new territory for me. So, itâs tempting to rationalize my way out of the new territory and into staying put in the old territory, where I donât have to change my ways. But my âLost 50 Daysâ episode showed me that trying to be the genius who solves all problems is not a sustainable strategy. As I look back, I now understand that if we had used the group approach to chart the process and test our theories right from the beginning of the 60 days, we would have actually made money on those test parts â and we would have completed the project weeks ahead of the deadline. Keep in mind a project like this can turn into very important revenue for our company. Our goal is to be able to process new jobs quickly and efficiently, put them in the boat and go get more. Obviously, not being effective or efficient in these situations can cost the company thousands of dollars. We have a long way to go. Again, the humbling part of owning even a successful business: thereâs always work to do. This experience also helped me make a connection that had previously eluded me. For more than six months, I have been increasingly aware that I have not been getting the same thrill from my work that I once did. Iâve done a lot of reading and reflecting on this. Iâve discussed it with people I trust. And, I have had a shift in my thinking. Iâm still figuring this out, and I donât really know how to explain it yet, but I sense that the learning I have done of late has rekindled the energy and motivation that has been lagging. Yes, itâs daunting to realize that I have to change the way I manage. But itâs also exciting because I want to change the way I manage. I donât really know where this is going, but Iâll continue to share the lessons and struggles as they come along.
