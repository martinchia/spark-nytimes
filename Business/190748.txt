DAVOS, Switzerland â By agreeing to buy IBM’s low-end server business for $2.3 billion, Lenovo of China instantly vaulted itself into the top ranks of the sector.  But executives at the Asian manufacturer argued on Thursday that the move did not mean it was trying to move away from the PC business. Instead, they said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum here, the deal advances Lenovo’s so-called PC Plus strategy of becoming the biggest computer maker in the world, whether the device is a laptop, a smartphone, a tablet or a server. “It’s a very logical extension of our strategy,” said Gerry P. Smith, the head of Lenovo’s Americas business. “A couple of years ago, we recognized that the business is not just about PCs anymore.” He pointed to internal comments by Lenovo’s chairman and chief executive, Yang Yuanqing, more than a year ago that were intended to challenge his employees. According to Mr. Smith, his boss said that at the moment, the company was No. 1 â at least, in terms of PC sales. But as of that day, the manufacturer should consider itself No. 3 in the computing industry over all, behind Hewlett-Packard and Dell. Lenovo has made no secret of its plans to use deals to drive growth, beginning in spectacular fashion with the Chinese company’s purchase of IBM’s personal computer arm for $1.75 billion over eight years ago. That experience helped establish a rapport between the two companies, though Mr. Smith declined to comment on reports that the two sides had tried and failed to strike a server deal last year. Buying IBM’s division will rapidly bolster Lenovo’s position in the broader enterprise market, a lucrative sector where it has been striving to grow. The deal will multiply annual revenue at Lenovo’s own low-end server business more than tenfold, from $385 million in annual revenue to nearly $5 billion. And by the company’s reckoning, it will move from No. 6 in the sector to third place. “We’ve gone from being an upstart to being very relevant,” Mr. Smith said. “It was an opportunity that we can’t pass up.” Analysts have posited that buying the server business would help Lenovo diversify beyond the slowing PC market. But Mr. Smith contended that the company remained committed to the latter business, pointing to its multiplying iterations of the ThinkPad and other laptops. And David Roman, the company’s chief marketing officer, added that even as overall computer sales slumped, certain segments â including high-end laptops â still showed indications of growth. “The PC market is still a $200 billion market,” Mr. Roman said. “We only have 18 percent market share.” While adding IBM’s server business will not add a rapidly growing profit engine, Lenovo points to how meaningfully it adds to the bottom line. What about national security concerns over the acquisition? The Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States, the main American governmental body that reviews security implications, will certainly take a look at Thursday’s transaction. But Mr. Smith suggested that the company believed the deal would pass. “We’ve done a number of acquisitions in the past,” he said. “We’ve worked with regulatory agencies openly.” But Mr. Smith and Mr. Roman emphasized that Lenovo was thinking beyond just computers and servers. The company already prides itself on being the fourth-biggest smartphone maker in the world, even though it currently focuses on emerging markets, where its ability to price devices more cheaply is not obscured by cellphone carrier subsidies in areas like the United States. Still, the company thinks it can succeed in building itself into a recognizable consumer brand without spending the kind of princely sums that Samsung of South Korea has to become a household name. Mr. Roman pointed to the company’s commitment to digital advertising and its partnerships with the likes of the actor and investor Ashton Kutcher to get its name and products better known. “We’d love more money in our budget,” he laughed. “But we think the landscape is changing already.” A version of this article appears in print on 01/24/2014, on page B4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Broader Strategy.
