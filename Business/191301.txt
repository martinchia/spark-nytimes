Standard & Poorâs lowered the debt of Puerto Rico to junk status on Tuesday, sending shock waves through the investor community, which has long enjoyed the tax-exempt interest generated by the islandâs municipal bonds. While S.&P. only dropped Puerto Ricoâs rating to BB+ from BBB-, the one-notch downgrade has intensified a cash squeeze for the commonwealth, Mary Williams Walsh writes in DealBook. Though much of the islandâs debt was issued with promises to make cash payments if it fell below investment grade, Puerto Rico is currently lacking the cash to make good on its word despite recent efforts to shore up liquidity. To make matters worse, some institutional holders of the debt have rules saying they cannot hold junk-rated debt â but only if two of the three top rating agencies downgrade the debt to below investment grade. While Moodyâs Investors Service and Fitch Ratings both rate the islandâs debt a single notch above junk, S.&P.âs downgrade has eroded market confidence, leaving investors fearing the worst.   MORGAN STANLEY TO PAY $1.25 BILLION IN MORTGAGE CASE Â |Â  Another day, another settlement. Morgan Stanley agreed on Tuesday to pay $1.25 billion to the Federal Housing Finance Agency to resolve claims that it sold faulty mortgage securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. If the Morgan Stanley settlement becomes final, it would be the third-largest monetary payment by a Wall Street firm to settle an F.H.F.A. lawsuit, Michael Corkery and Jessica Silver-Greenberg write in DealBook.
 But the F.H.F.A. still has pending mortgage securities cases against about a dozen other financial institutions. Still, progress is being made. In a separate action on Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase agreed to a $614 million deal with federal prosecutors who accused the bank of violating the rules of the Federal Housing Administrationâs mortgage insurance program. And last Friday, a New York State Supreme Court judge approved an $8.5 billion settlement between Bank of America and a group of investors that purchased mortgage securities that went sour during the credit crisis.   MICROSOFTâS NEW CHIEF Â |Â  After an intense period of speculation, Microsoft has announced its new leader. The company on Tuesday named Satya Nadella as its chief executive, only the third in Microsoftâs almost 40-year history. The selection of Mr. Nadella to succeed Steven A. Ballmer came at the same time as news that Bill Gates, the companyâs founder, had stepped down from his role as chairman to become a technology adviser to Mr. Nadella. John W. Thompson became the companyâs new chairman. Mr. Gates said Mr. Nadella is âa proven leader with hard-core engineering skills, business vision and the ability to bring people together.â Though he is known for using technical jargon in his conversations and speeches, he is nevertheless seen by many as likable and able to take charge. âMr. Nadella is probably as good a choice as the company could make,â Robert Cyran of Reuters Breakingviews writes. âThe old guard is slipping into the background,â giving Mr. Nadella plenty of room to âturn Microsoft toward a more focused, and potentially valuable, future.”   ON THE AGENDA Â |Â  The ADP national employment report for January is out at 8:15 a.m. The I.S.M. nonmanufacturing index for January is released at 10 a.m. The House Committee on Financial Services holds a hearing at 10 a.m. to discuss the effect of the Volcker Rule on job creation, its second on the subject.

A LESSON ON HERBALIFEâS VOLATILE STOCK PRICE Â |Â  When William A. Ackman, founder of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, announced a year ago that his firm had taken a $1 billion short position in Herbalife, he was essentially betting that the company was operating as a pyramid scheme. Herbalife, of course, vehemently denied Mr. Ackmanâs claims. âItâs now a year later, and I still donât know who is right,â Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. But to some investors in Herbalife, the truth does not seem to matter. Though hedge funds and even individual investors have jumped into the fray, these outsiders have not provided any clarity on Herbalifeâs business model, creating extreme volatility in the companyâs stock as investors trade on speculation and innuendo rather than fact. Mr. Davidoff writes: âWhat we have here is the opposite of a search for truth. No one has shown a great interest in examining the company to find out what is exactly going on.â   ANOTHER âWOLF OF WALL STREETâ BOOK DEAL Â |Â  The book, by Christina McDowell, whose father Tom Prousalis went to prison for his involvement with the âWolf of Wall Streetâ kingpin, Jordan Belfort, will be based on this open letter, which she wrote to discourage people from seeing the movie.

DEBT CEILING WATCH Â |Â  On Friday, the United States Treasury will lose its ability to issue new net debt.
