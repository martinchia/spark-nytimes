The nation’s top-grossing 200 law firms have garnered about half of the country’s business spending on legal services since 2010, according to a new analysis by the American Lawyer, which tracks data at the biggest law firms. Yet the underlying picture is more nuanced. When adjusted for inflation, the analysis found, the revenue the law firms logged in 2013 is diminished considerably from 2004. Although revenue for outside legal providers plunged after 2008, by 2010 the so-called Am Law 200 firms commanded 47 percent of all business spending on legal fees in the United States, according to the American Lawyer, which is published by ALM. Since then, the top 200 firms have maintained that share. Even so, growth in legal services has been modest, rising just 4.6 percent from 2010 through 2013. That is less than half the growth rate law firms had experienced in the boom years before the onset of the recession. Last year, the analysis found, business spending on outside legal service providers was $168.7 billion, $6.4 billion lower than at its peak in 2008 of $175.1 billion. During the decade that began in 2004, annual business spending on legal services rose modestly, to $168.7 billion in 2013 from $159.4 billion in 2004. But in inflation-adjusted dollars, American Lawyerâs analysis noted, revenue fell to $118.3 billion in 2013, 25.8 percent lower than in 2004. The elite firms, which employ about 92,000 lawyers, posted $776,000 in gross revenue per lawyer last year, according to figures from ALM Legal Intelligence, the proprietary database of law firm data, which also used Census Bureau and other data to reach its conclusions. But in inflation-adjusted terms, the revenue per lawyer sank to $438,000, the lowest point since such statistics began to be tracked in 1998. “The alarm bell sounded six years ago,” said Aric Press, senior vice president, editor in chief of ALM and the author of the analysis, “and it has not stopped since then. Law firms need to focus like lasers on their clients and the ways they do business.” The winners were the equity partners at big law firms. After adjusting for inflation, profits per equity partner came in at just under $1.2 million last year, the seventh-highest amount recorded since 1998. A group of 21 firms dominated, with profits per equity partner of $3 million, or $2.1 million on an inflation-adjusted basis. The huge compensation gap gives the top 21 firms, each of which posted revenue of $1 billion or more last year, the wherewithal to punch up their bottom lines even further. They can dangle high compensation packages to lure away partners (and their established list of clients) from rival law firms. These top firms â among them Cravath, Swaine & Moore; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; Sullivan & Cromwell; and Wachtell Lipton, Rosen & Katz â have several things in common. Fourteen started in New York and continue to be focused on their offices there. Six others have major presences in the city. Only Irell & Manella, whose 166 lawyers are based in Southern California, does not have a New York office. The firms also charge premium rates for their market-leading practices in areas including mergers and acquisitions, high-yield debt and capital markets. Advertisement
