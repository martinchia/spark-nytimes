Settlement Said to Be Near for Fannie and Freddie  |  A proposed agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission would end an investigation into whether Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac adequately disclosed their exposure to risky subprime loans.  The proposed agreement, under the terms being discussed, would include no monetary penalty or admission of fraud, according to several people briefed on the case. Still, a settlement would represent the most significant acknowledgement yet by the mortgage finance companies that they played a central role in the housing boom and bust. The potential accord  comes at an awkward time for both firms. Should Fannie and Freddie sound a note of contrition for their own role in the implosion of the mortgage market, it could complicate a separate but similar lawsuit playing out in Washington. Last week, the government overseer of the two companies sued 17 large financial firms, blaming them for luring Fannie and Freddie into buying troubled loans.
