Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. The proverbial stork, bringer of babies and emblem of fertility, has been driven off course by the socialist welfare state. Now that people can rely on the state for income security in old age, they no longer need children. Social Security is undermining parenthood. Today's EconomistPerspectives from expert contributors.This conservative argument, flapping recently through the news media, leads to the distinctly unconservative argument that we should provide more public support for parents â a policy that many liberals and feminists (including me) also advocate. A closer look at this political paradox helps explain some basic points of disagreement about the impact of the welfare state.  Perspectives from expert contributors. The economist Ed Yardeni makes a simplistic case for âcrowding outâ on his blog, with a graph showing that countries with the largest public pension programs also have the lowest fertility.  This is hardly persuasive, given considerable evidence offered by the economist Peter Lindert and others that public pensions, like other forms of social spending, are strongly associated with economic development, which, in turn, promotes fertility decline. Changes in the economic and political position of women have a huge impact on family-size decisions.  The historical panorama is long and complicated. In the United States, the total fertility rate  among whites declined from about 7 children per woman in 1800 to about 2.5 children per woman in 1930, long before the Social Security Act of 1935 was passed. A small baby boom became apparent in the 1950s, and the total fertility rate reached about 3.5 in 1960, before declining to about 2.1 in 2000, about where it remains today.  Trends among other racial and ethnic groups, though less well documented, have followed a similar pattern.  Public pensions may have emerged partly as a response to fertility decline, rather than a cause of it. Still, once in place, these programs may have had a slightly negative effect on fertility in recent years in the United States and elsewhere. Ross Douthat of The New York Times and Ramesh Ponnuru of National Review developed this more nuanced argument of âpartial crowding out,â building on more detailed policy analysis by the economist Robert Stein.   They express serious concern that Social Security transfers resources from parents â who invest considerable time and energy in raising the children who will help finance it â to nonparents, who get the same benefits per lifetime dollar earned (all else equal) but spend far less on the next generation.  The contribution that nonparents make is largely limited to payment of taxes that help subsidize child-rearing and education. Concern about what might be termed âfamily fairnessâ sets these conservatives apart from others critical of Social Security, especially those who favor converting it to a mandatory private savings program, as proposed by the Bush administration in 2005. That change would, as Robert Stein puts it, also âcrowd out the traditional motive to have kids.â  Ideally, Mr. Ponnuru explains, the best solution would be to eliminate all entitlements. But because he considers this option politically unlikely, he favors a major expansion of the child tax credit, quintupling it to $5,000 per child. Such a significant increase in public spending (in the form of tax subsidy) would significantly improve the position of parents with children under 17.  Other proposals to increase the child tax credit â which I believe is a good idea â are now in play, and I plan to discuss the specifics in a future post.  Meanwhile, consider the assertion that, in the best of all worlds, elimination of all entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare would solve the problem. The reasoning behind this claim is not fully developed but the clear implication is that parents would be able to directly benefit from the earnings of their adult children (while nonparents would not). This âpaybackâ would presumably create greater incentives to have children.  Such a private family arrangement may have been viable in a high-fertility society in which children were less costly and most adults worked until they died at a relatively young age. Today, the costs of caring for dependents are much higher, and reliance on children for old-age security hardly seems viable.  As an insurance program, it would be extraordinarily risky. Your children might predecease you or just get peeved with you and move away (a process the economic historian Richard Sutch refers to as âchild defaultâ). Or they might decide to become artists, writers or stay-at-home parents without enough discretionary income to take care of you.  Most individuals would enjoy far more old-age security if they invested the money they would have spent on children in a diversified portfolio or annuity. The economic incentives to raise children would decline even further if entitlements for children or spending on education were reduced.  Mr. Stein emphasizes that public policies benefiting parents donât come close to covering the costs of raising children. True enough, but they provide far more support than would be forthcoming in a fully privatized economy.  Socializing a hefty proportion of the costs of caring for dependents makes good economic sense. Thatâs exactly why we need reforms that could bring public support for parents and children into balance with support for the elderly.  In this context, Iâm far less worried about the proverbial stork than the proverbial ostrich, who responds to difficulty by sticking its head into the sand.
