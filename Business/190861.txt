If it can’t buy a cosmetics company, Joh. A. Benckiser will take coffee instead. The German conglomerate said on Monday that it would buy Peet’s Coffee & Tea for $973.9 million in cash, taking control of one of the country’s oldest purveyors of specialty coffee. Under the terms of the deal, Benckiser will pay $73.50 a share, nearly 29 percent above Peet’s closing price on Friday.  Shares in Peet’s had fallen 6 percent in the last 12 months through Friday, amid concerns about its growth prospects. That slide has been reversed, however: Shares in Peet’s shot up in midmorning trading on Monday, surpassing the offer price at $73.64. The stocks of other coffee companies, including the beleaguered Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, initially rose as well on hopes that other deals were on the horizon. Green Mountain’s shares have since fallen back.  The transaction was announced a little over two months after one of Benckiser’s other holdings, the cosmetics maker Coty, withdrew a $10.7 billion takeover bid for Avon Products. In an interesting twist, one of Benckiser’s partners in that proposed deal, the merchant banking firm BDT Capital Partners, has agreed to invest in the Peet’s deal. Benckiser, a holding company for the Reimann family of Germany, already owns a wide range of consumer companies, including Coty, Jimmy Choo and the household products giant Reckitt Benckiser. It also owns a minority stake in D.E. Master Blenders 1753, a European coffee maker. âWe are committed to owning and investing in companies with strong, premier-quality brands and great people whose values we share,â Bart Becht, Benckiser’s chairman, said in a statement. âPeetâs is just such a company and we look forward to preserving the companyâs culture and core values, while supporting managementâs vision for future growth.” Founded in 1966 in Berkeley, Calif., Peet’s has grown from a single shop to 196 stores in six states. The company also has a grocery coffee business that has recently outperformed the retail business. Peet’s occupies a notable place in the evolution of American coffee drinking. It was the first company to successfully offer higher grades of coffee, like arabica, and was the initial supplier to a nascent Seattle-based coffee shop named Starbucks. And it maintains a fan base whose members are known as “peetniks.” In addition to BDT Capital, Benckiser was advised by Morgan Stanley and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Peet’s was advised by Citigroup and the law firm Cooley. Advertisement
