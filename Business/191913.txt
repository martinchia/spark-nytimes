In 1970 the Penn Central railroad unexpectedly filed for bankruptcy, nearly taking down the money market in the process.  It was the biggest bankruptcy case of its time, and litigation surrounding the case continued well past the turn of the  century. Penn Central might give us some insight into the fate that awaits Lehman Brothers, even as it nears approval of its Chapter 11 plan. Take Lehmanâs important litigation against JPMorgan Chase.  On the eve of Lehmanâs collapse, JPMorgan demanded several different types of special protection, including liens and guarantees. Normally this would be a slam-dunk win for Lehman.  The bankruptcy code is premised on the notion of creditor equality, and in an effort to avert gaming of that system it includes a rule that looks back 90 days before the case is filed.  Creditors who improve their position during that time lose the benefit of that improvement.  This protects the equality principle, and helps to make ârunsâ on the debtor company pointless. The reason that this is not an easy case turns on the âsafe harborâ provisions of the bankruptcy code, which exempt several broad classes of financial transactions from the normal rules of bankruptcy, especially with regard to derivative contracts.  JPMorgan essentially argues that these provisions blow a giant, C.D.S.-sized hole in Lehmanâs case. So where do things stand in the case? First off, the parties are fighting over which judge can hear the case.  As I predicted in an earlier DealBook column, the Supreme Courtâs opinion in Stern v. Marshall has created an opportunity for defendants to argue that their case canât be heard in bankruptcy court anymore.  JPMorgan has taken up that opportunity, arguing in a 45-page brief that the case must move to the Federal District Court in Manhattan. Of course that court has other things to do besides hearing bankruptcy cases, and some of those tasks, like criminal trials, get priority.  If the case does move to the district court — and even the fight over moving the case might not be short — we can expect an already lengthy trial to take even longer. JPMorgan has argued that its move to invoke Stern is not about preferring one forum over another.  Maybe, but it could have waived the Stern argument and it didnât. The news is pretty much the same in other cases coming out of the financial crisis. In Washington Mutual, the second attempt at a plan has been rejected by the bankruptcy court, the hedge funds who got dinged in the judgeâs opinion are appealing, and the shareholders have just hired Frank Partnoy, a well-known law professor and finance expert, to examine the claims they might have regarding the entire WaMu mess.   Penn Central may seem speedy compared with these cases. Advertisement
