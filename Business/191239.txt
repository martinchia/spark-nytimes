Updated, 4:30 p.m. |  The reinsurance arm of Third Point, the hedge fund run by Daniel S. Loeb, overcame a rocky start in its market debut.  Third Point Re shares closed at at $13.06, up 4.5 percent. That’s well above their opening price of $12.25 a share, though off their intraday high of $13.50.  Underwriters for Third Point Reinsurance priced the stock sale at $12.50, at the low end of its forecast range, but they slightly cut the size of the offering, to 22.1 million shares.  The offering valued the firm at nearly $1.3 billion. Third Point Re’s business is reinsurance, in which it takes over insurance policies in return for a fee, essentially backing up traditional insurers. Mr. Loeb’s firm moved into the sector at a time when other hedge funds, like Greenlight Capital and SAC Capital, had as well. Though Third Point Re serves as a reinsurer, its investment portfolio is managed by its parent company, providing the hedge fund with a stable source of capital. Third Point Re trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TPRE. Advertisement
