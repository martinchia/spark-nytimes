After missing deadlines for several new derivatives rules last month, financial regulators are now bearing down on the freewheeling industry.  On Thursday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission finalized a fresh batch of regulations governing the $600 trillion market, giving the government new tools to help monitor the financial industry. The rules, most notably, allow the agency to collect a battery of data on derivatives deals and operate a whistle-blower program to reward tipsters who exposed fraud in the marketplace.   “The C.F.T.C. has turned the corner toward final rules,” Gary Gensler, the agencyâs chairman, said at a public meeting in Washington. “Today, we are building on this momentum.” Last month, the commodity commission adopted the first in a series of derivatives regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act, the vast financial regulatory overhaul enacted after the crisis. The rules granted the government broad new powers to prosecute fraud and insider trading within the derivatives market.  But the agency has finalized only 11 new rules so far this summer, a small dent in its Dodd-Frank duty. Some 40 rules remain on hold, including the most contentious proposals that will spell out which companies are exempt from the overhaul.    Regulators fell behind on the rules amid complaints from industry lobbyists and Republican lawmakers who have said that the agency was a threat to an economic recovery. In response, regulators agreed in June to holdup many new derivatives regulations until the end of the year, a nearly six-month delay. Mr. Gensler said on Thursday that his agency was “likely” to take up some thornier rules in the fall, while cautioning that the entire process remained in flux. “I say ‘likely’ because there’s a lot of work to be done and this could easily change,” he said.  For now, Mr. Gensler was satisfied signing off on just the data rules and whistle-blower program.  The agency, in a 4-1 vote, adopted an array of requirements for so-called swap data repositories. The new entities will collect once-private data about swap trades, a type of derivative contract that is tied to the value of a commodity, mortgage or other asset. Under the rules, the repositories must authenticate and aggregate pricing information and other data electronically so regulators can keep an eye on the market.  “Leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, swaps operated in the shadows,” Mr. Gensler said in a statement. “With this rule, regulators — for the first time — will have specific information on the market’s scale and risk.” But some on the commission questioned whether the rule was too soft. Michael Dunn, a Democrat like Mr. Gensler, expressed “grave concerns” that the regulation did not require data collectors to feature independent directors. The whistle-blower rule, also adopted in a 4-1 vote, generated its own controversy. The program would provide a bounty to whistle-blowers who exposed Ponzi schemes or other wrongdoing. To qualify for the reward, tipsters must turn over new information that spawns a “successful enforcement action” worth more than $1 million.  Republican commissioners, one of whom voted against the program, complained that it would allow insiders to bypass internal compliance departments and take their tips straight to the government. The criticism echoed concerns recently raised about the S.E.C.âs new whistle-blower program, which was adopted in May.  But Bart Chilton, a Democrat on the commission, said the whistle-blower program had improved over time.  “Frankly, this rule wasn’t too hot when we first proposed it,” he said. But now, he added, “I think it will be a very important tool in our enforcement arsenal.” Advertisement
