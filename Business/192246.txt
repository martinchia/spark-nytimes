Gigya was once a creature of an earlier social media age, starting in 2006 as a way to assist people with pages on the ill-fated social network Myspace. But the company has evolved, now acting as an intermediary between the likes of Facebook and corporate websites. To help it grow, Gigya said on Tuesday that it had raised a $35 million round of financing led by the venture capital arm of Intel. Gigyaâs business is based in part on something called social logins. The company lets people log in to the websites of Tommy Hilfiger, Dell, NBC and many others by entering their social media credentials. That allows the websites to use data shared on the social network to fine-tune their marketing. Gigya makes money by charging fees to the companies that use its software, which also includes tools to let people register and set up profiles on corporate sites. Patrick Salyer, Gigya’s chief executive, said about 700 companies worldwide use its software. He added the Gigya had processed more than a billion registrations and logins so far this year. Mr. Salyer, 33, a Harvard graduate who started his career in consulting, joined Gigya in 2007, near its beginning. He helped the company âpivotâ (to use the Silicon Valley lingo) to its current strategy in 2009. He became chief executive in 2011. In addition to Intel Capital, the new financing round includes the investment firms Commonfund Capital and Vintage Investment Partners. Several existing investors, including Adobe and the venture capital firm Mayfield Fund, also participated. Gigya did not disclose its revenue, profit or valuation in the round. Mr. Salyer said the investment from Intel involved more than just capital. He said Gigya was working on a partnership with the company involving identity and security, though he declined to discuss it in detail. âWhen we looked at addressing the problem of passwords, we were impressed with the platform and reach that Gigya has developed,â Mark Hocking, an executive at Intelâs security arm, said in a statement. “Given its scale, proven leadership and ubiquity in the market, we saw a huge opportunity to not only collaborate with the company but also to invest.â Advertisement
