LONDON â As the Russian gold producer Polymetal joins a major British stock index, its chief executive is seeking to attract international investors and expand its operations, mainly in the former Soviet Union.  On Monday, Polymetal and Evraz, a steel maker partly owned by the Russian billionaire Roman A. Abramovich, became the first Russian companies to be included in the FTSE 100 share index in London. Last month, Polymetal moved its main listing to London.  The decision comes as its chief executive, Vitaly N. Nesis, has moved to remake the gold company into a more shareholder-friendly firm consistent with the practices of large international businesses. Bad corporate governance rather than local politics has been the biggest obstacle for Russian companies seeking to attract foreign capital, Mr. Nesis said on Monday.  Polymetal, which owns silver and gold mines in Russia, had to appoint several independent directors to its board and sell more than 50 percent of the company on the stock market to qualify for the benchmark listing. Still, some analysts have expressed criticism that three shareholders, including Mr. Nesis’s brother, still control a combined 45 percent of the company. âI understand these concerns and there is always room to improve,â Mr. Nesis said in an interview at the London Stock Exchange. But he added that changes must not be rushed and that âit was difficult for the large shareholders to accept the independence of the board, and that even when they act together they canât have the influence as before. Itâs a relatively lengthy thought process.â Mr. Nesis said he picked a stock listing in London rather than New York because British investors “are more familiar with Russia and understand the companies better.” The higher regulatory cost associated with an American share listing was another reason, he said. Mr. Nesis said investors in London ârealize that the issue with Russian companies lies with corporate government not with the Russian government. In the U.S., people worry about political risk, which I donât think is important for Russiaâs economic development.â Street protests in Moscow challenging the recent election as well as corruption and judicial fraud prompted the countryâs stock market to drop over the last two weeks. Many investors were spooked by the short-term instability in the country even if Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin is widely expected to be elected president in March. Mr. Nesis said he hoped âthe situation in Russia would improve and that the protests would hopefully prompt them to do something about the most pressing problems.â Polymetal, which is based in St. Petersburg, plans to expand its operations, mainly in the former Soviet Union, Mr. Nesis said.  âThereâs no reason for us to go to Latin America or Southeast Asia,â he said. âThe former Soviet Union is huge, and I feel we have enough opportunities for the next decade.â The company expects to take advantage of financing difficulties faced by some smaller rivals, which find it harder to get credit from banks or through selling equity.  âItâs a buyersâ market,â Mr. Nesis said. âI expect this to develop even more favorably for us in the next 12 months despite the high gold prices.â Advertisement
