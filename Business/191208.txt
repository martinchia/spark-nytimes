Some banks may have become too big to prosecute, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said last week in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. That comment â an acknowledgment, for the first time, that Mr. Holder has not pursued big bank prosecutions out of fear of possibly harming the financial system â raises a variety of questions, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. âDoes this mean that our banks are still too big to fail? Should we prosecute corporations? Should the size of an institution or its systemic importance influence the decision of prosecutors? Whatâs the right policy?â “At a minimum, Mr. Holderâs comments are embarrassingly at odds with the Obama administrationâs view that too-big-to-fail was fixed by the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law.â But the remarks also point to a deeper question of whether indicting corporations is effective. âThe fact that prosecutors have not claimed a big-time scalp in the financial crisis obscures the issue of prosecuting companies themselves and the complications such prosecutions raise.â The case of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen provides a lesson. âThe charges against the firm put it out of business, and 28,000 employees â most of whom had nothing to do with the Enron case or the shredding of documents â lost their jobs. Making matters worse, the conviction of Arthur Andersen was overruled on appeal by the Supreme Court. Prosecutors decided not to pursue the case. Ever since then, the Justice Department has been much more cognizant of the collateral damage of bringing a criminal case against a company â as opposed to prosecuting the individual employees responsible for the crime.â   NOMINEE FOR S.E.C. CHIEF SET TO WOO CRITICS Â |Â  Mary Jo White, President Obamaâs pick to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission, is going before the Senate Banking Committee in a hearing starting at 10 a.m., with plans to deflect concerns about her ability to regulate the banks she recently defended. In written testimony released on Monday, Ms. White outlined her experience going after white-collar crime as a federal prosecutor in New York, pledging to continue rooting out financial fraud as head of the S.E.C., DealBookâs Ben Protess reports. âIf confirmed, it will be a high priority throughout my tenure to further strengthen the enforcement function of the S.E.C. â it must be fair, but it also must be bold and unrelenting,â Ms. White said in the testimony. âStrong enforcement is necessary for investor confidence and is essential to the integrity of our financial markets.â Ms. Whiteâs testimony âprovided the first window into her priorities as an S.E.C. chief,â Mr. Protess says. âShe placed a premium on unearthing financial fraud, while also spelling out an agenda that included keeping a closer eye on high-speed trading firms and putting the finishing touches on new rules for Wall Street.â Also at the hearing will be Richard Cordray, who was reappointed as head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. DealBook will be live-blogging the confirmation hearing.    ICAHN GOES MUM; DELL FOUNDER SPEAKS OUT Â |Â  Carl C. Icahn, who last week seemed poised to join the shareholder opposition to the proposed $24.4 billion buyout of Dell, has agreed to review the computer makerâs confidential data. The move keeps the activist investor silent, for now, as he examines Dellâs books as a participant in the âgo shopâ process being run by Dellâs board, DealBookâs Michael J. de la Merced reports. In a statement on Monday, Mr. Icahnâs firm said it âlooks forward to commencing its review of Dellâs confidential information.â Meanwhile, the bidding group â Michael S. Dell and the investment firm Silver Lake â has hired Citigroup to provide advice, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cites unidentified people familiar with the matter. The move would prevent another possible bidder from using Citigroupâs services. With Citigroup in the bidderâs camp, most of the big Wall Street banks would now be working on the deal in some capacity. Mr. Dell gave a rare interview about the deal. He told the radio program Marketplace that the proposed transaction âmeans the company will be even more founder-led than it was in its first few decades. I think this is very good for our customers. It gives our shareholders an opportunity to take advantage of some of the benefits of the things that we are doing as a company without taking on all the risks that I and Silver Lake will bear.â    ON THE AGENDA Â |Â  Costco Wholesale reports earnings before the market opens, and Dole Food reports earnings on Tuesday evening.

In particular, it cited the period from 2005 to 2009, when Illinois also issued $2.2 billion in bonds.â Still, âthe S.E.C. did not measure any loss in dollars, and it did not impose fines or penalties in Mondayâs settlement.â    Â |Â  Contact: @williamalden | E-mail   Sign up for the DealBook Newsletter, delivered every morning and afternoon.   Hostess Announces Buyers for Snack Business Â |Â  Apollo Global Management and C.
