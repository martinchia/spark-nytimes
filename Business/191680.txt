BEIJING â The Dalian Wanda Group, the Chinese property and entertainment conglomerate, signed an agreement on Tuesday to buyÂ  the sports marketing company InfrontÂ Sports and Media for $1.2 billion. Wanda purchased a 68.2 percent stake in Infront from Bridgepoint, a European private equity firm. The acquisition of the company, based in Switzerland, willÂ ââdrive the development of Chinese sports industry and its interest around the globe,ââ Wang Jianlin, chairman andÂ  founder of Wanda, said in a statement.Â  Wanda did not disclose who would holdÂ  the remaining Infront shares. Mr. Wang, one of Chinaâs wealthiestÂ investors, also said at a signing ceremony that the company would acquire atÂ  least two more ââcultural companiesââÂ  this year. Wanda plans to generate 20Â  percent of its projected $100 billion revenue in 2020 from overseas. The president and chief executive ofÂ Infront, Philippe Blatter, the nephew ofÂ  Sepp Blatter, the president of the soccerÂ federation FIFA, said in the statementÂ  that the two parties would ââjointlyÂ  tackle a variety of major expansion projects.ââ Mr. Blatter will continue heading Infront after the acquisition. In recent years, Wanda, which startedÂ  as a real estate developer in China, has been on a shopping spree, buying entertainment and cultural companies. LastÂ  month, the company bought a 20 percent stake in the Spanish football clubÂ  AtlÃ©tico Madrid. In 2012, it purchasedÂ  the American movie theater chain AMCÂ  Entertainment Holdings. ââWe want to boost and strengthen theÂ  cultural industry,ââ Mr. Wang said atÂ  Tuesdayâs ceremony, held in a glitteringÂ  conference room decorated with largeÂ  cymbiform lamps at Wandaâs SofitelÂ  Hotel in Beijingâs central business district. ââOur president has said he has threeÂ  dreams: to make it into the World Cup,Â  to host one and to win one,ââ Mr. WangÂ  said, referring to President Xi Jinping ofÂ  China. ââInfront has the capabilities andÂ  resources to help us accelerate theÂ  achievement of these three dreams,ââÂ  Mr. Wang said. He and Mr. Blatter wereÂ  seated on a stage flanked by a half- dozen tall and slim waitresses in flowingÂ  gauze dresses. Infront, with more than 600 employees in 13 countries, is a leading player inÂ  the sports marketing industry. It is theÂ  sole sales representative for ââdistribution of Asian broadcast rightsââ for theÂ  2018 and 2022âs FIFA World Cup, theÂ  company said in 2011. Advertisement
