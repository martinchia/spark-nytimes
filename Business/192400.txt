Reports on legal issues confronting small businesses. Like many business owners, Chanel Jones chose to use her first name when she named her business.Â Ms. Jones — who did not respond to attempts to contact her — probably never expected to face a lawsuit based on that decision, especially not one filed by a huge, multinational corporation. But in August, Chanel Inc., the fashion and beauty company, filed suit against Ms. Jones claiming that her hair salon in Merrillville, Ind.,Â Chanelâs Salon, was violating trademark and unfair competition laws, capitalizing on the âfame, recognition, and goodwill” of Chanelâs trademark and engendering âconfusion by creating a false impression that Chanel is the source of or somehow sponsorsâ Ms. Jonesâ services. The company sought an injunction preventing her from using the name. According to the complaint, Ms. Jones began using the business name âChanelâs Salonâ two years ago. In July 2013, Chanel sent Ms. Jones a cease-and-desist letter requesting that she change her salonâs name so that it did not include the word âChanel.â The company said it sent four follow-up letters to Ms. Jones but claimed it never received a reply. (Lawyers for Chanel would not comment on the case.) To discuss how business owners can handle similar situations, we contacted David Bell, a trademark partner at Haynes and Boone in Dallas, who has represented both plaintiffs and defendants in trademark litigation. The following conversation has been edited and condensed.  Should business owners simply forget about using their own name for a business if they share itÂ with an established brand? Problems can arise where the brand name is well-known and unique and the small business operates in the same or a similar industry, as is the case here. To win a case, the well-known brand must show that the small businessâs use of its name could “reasonably” cause confusion or tarnish its reputation. Is there anything business owners who are determined to use their own names can do to prevent lawsuits? If Chanel Jones had used her full name, she might not have gotten sued. Or she could have added a word or phrase to her salonâs name, maybe calling it Chanelâs Pizzazz Salon â anything to make it more eclectic. In the same way, a company called Ford Electronics might be sued by Ford Motor Company. But if it were called John W. Ford Electronics, the case would be tougher for Ford to win. What advice do you have for business owners who realize that their business name may make them a target for a lawsuit? If theyâve recently opened shop, itâs a good idea to consider a name change before investing significantly in the business. But if itâs too late for that, there are other steps to take. These include making sure that any company logo plays up the differences between the small business and the well-known brand. For example, in the hypothetical Ford example, it would be wise to play up the word electronics, making it more conspicuous than the word Ford. Also, avoid using the same colors and taglines as the well known brand. Additionally, small-business owners should add disclaimers to any online or other marketing materials, something that states they are not affiliated with whatever big brand shares their name. Finally, as in the Chanel case, in most situations, the business owner will receive at least one cease-and-desist letter. Donât ignore it. You can usually work something out at that stage. Small-business owners might see these lawsuits as frivolous, petty, or mean-spirited. Are they? No. Big brand owners arenât lawsuit-happy. They donât sue out of spite but out of obligation. They have often invested millions of dollars or more to create the awareness and goodwill associated with their names. Itâs critical for them to prevent any use of that name that might create confusion or weaken their brand. What type of legal expenses do small-business owners face once a complaint is filed against them? Simply filing the required answer could easily cost several thousand dollars. In the last few years, Iâve defended a couple of trademark cases where my clients did want to settle. In both those cases, it took nine months to reach a settlement with the big brand, and the clients spent well over $100,000. Do you have any thoughts on how the Chanel case will be resolved? These cases typically settle — and the easiest solution might be for Ms. Jones to change the business name to Chanel Jones Salon. That seems like a reasonable compromise to me.
