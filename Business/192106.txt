Itâs easy to forget to bring a gift card when you go shopping, and it’s simple, too, to lose track of gift cards received during holidays past. A new iPhone application from Wildcard Network aims to make gift cards more convenient to use. The free app helps iPhone users manage gift cards from about 30 retailers. Hereâs how it works.
 After downloading the application, those who want to give gift cards as gifts would buy the cards for themselves within the application using their credit card and then regift the cards to the recipients’ e-mail addresses or Wildcard Network accounts. Gift card recipients, meanwhile, can upload their gift cards to the application by entering in the card numbers and other information. Once a card is uploaded, its bar code and number can be shown to participating retailers. The application also keeps track of the balances left on the gift cards in its system,Â  and the terms and conditions for the cards can also be viewed within the application. The application seems to solve the problems of not having a gift card with you when you want to use it and of losing gift cards. It still, however, doesnât necessarily resolve the issue of forgetting to use the card. Still, it does seem to make gift cards easier and more convenient to use. âWe want to help consumers so they donât forget the card,â said Raj Basavaraju, founder and chief executive of Wildcard Network. With the application, âthe card is always with them wherever they go,â or at least wherever they bring their phone and the phone works. Wildcard Network, which collects revenue from sales commissions for selling cards and plans to collect sponsored advertising revenue eventually,  expects to sign on 10 more retailers by the holiday season. In addition, it plans to introduce an Android version of the application before the end of the year and a BlackBerry version early next year. Wildcard Network is not the only player in this area. Another company, Tango Card, recently announced a similar offering. How do you make gift cards more convenient, so you donât forget to use them or don’t lose track of them?
