A new report has surfaced about a big round of layoffs coming at the Man Group. Last week, Business Insider reported that Man, the world’s largest publicly traded hedge fund manager, was preparing to lay off as much as 10 percent of its work force because of overlaps created by its $1.6 billion acquisition GLG Partners. Now, The Wall Street Journal, echoing that report, says that Man is planning to cut as many as 200 jobs from its 1,800 person staff during the next six months. The cutbacks, which would be among the largest at a major hedge fund firm in recent history, will primarily come from layoffs, The Journal said. Some cuts, however, will also come from attrition and by not renewing consultant contracts, an unidentified person told The Journal. A spokesman for Man, David Waller, told The Journal that the previously announced $50 million of savings from the merger with GLG included layoffs, in addition to other measures, but he declined to provide details relating to the job cuts.
