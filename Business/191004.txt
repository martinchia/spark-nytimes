LONDON â Credit Suisse moved to calm investorsâ fears on Friday by announcing it expected to report a second-quarter profit. The European financial giant did not provide specifics on its quarterly figures, which will be announced on July 26. The statement comes a week after Credit Suisse responded to calls from Switzerlandâs central bank that the Swiss firm should increase its capital reserves this year because of Europeâs debt crisis.  The Swiss National Bank had singled out Credit Suisse in its annual financial stability report as a bank that needs to âsignificantly expand its loss-absorbing capital during the current year.â The country’s central bank said Credit Suisseâs local rival, UBS, should just continue with its efforts to strengthen its capital, the central bank said. Credit Suisse dismissed the regulatorâs calls to strengthen the bank’s cash buffers. âThe Board is confident that management’s plans will continue to ensure that Credit Suisse not only fulfills, but exceeds its regulatory capital requirements,â the bank said in a statement on June 22. In early afternoon trading, the bankâs share price rose 5.5 percent, as investors reacted positively to Credit Suisseâs announcement that it was profitable in the second quarter of 2012. Like many of Europeâs largest banks, Credit Suisse has suffered from a reduction of trading activity and a fall in consumer and corporate spending amid the global financial crisis. The Swiss bankâs profit in the first three months of the year fell to 44 million Swiss francs,or $46 million, from 1.1 billion francs in the first quarter of 2011, mostly because of charges on the value on its own debt.
