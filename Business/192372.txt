LONDON â Electra Private Equity said on Wednesday that two influential shareholder advisory services had recommended that investors reject a bid by the activist investor Edward J. Bramson for two seats on the firmâs board of directors. The spat between Electra, a British private equity firm, and Sherborne Investors Management, Mr. Bramsonâs New York-based investment vehicle, has been heating up in recent days ahead of a shareholder meeting set for Oct. 6. Mr. Bramson is pushing to shake up the British private equity firmâs board, saying a change in strategy could bolster the companyâs stock price by more than 1 billion pounds, or about $1.6 billion. The company’s board rejected his request for three seats earlier this year. Electra has maintained that it has always had an independent board and that it doesnât believe that Mr. Bramson and Ian Brindle, a longtime associate and former chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers in Britain, would be independent. On Wednesday, Electra said that Institutional Shareholder Services, the proxy advisory group, and Pensions & Investment Research Consultants both recommended that shareholders vote against Mr. Bramsonâs slate of nominees. âThe board of directors of Electra unanimously recommends that all shareholders vote against all the general meeting resolutions,â the company said in a news release on Wednesday. Electra is an investment trust focused on private equity investments. Its portfolio of companies includes South Lakeland Parks, an operator of trailer parks in Britain; Daler-Rowney, a manufacturer of art supplies; and Hotter Shoes, a footwear company. Mr. Bramson has not detailed what his intended strategy change is, but has said that the firmâs board needs âfresh perspective.â In a letter to Electra shareholders last week, Mr. Bramson said the board had turned over responsibility for its investments to its fund manager, Electra Partners, and, because of its current composition, it had been âless effectiveâ in managing its relationship with the fund manager. Mr. Bramson is seeking the removal of Geoffrey Cullinan as a director, saying it would be difficult for Mr. Cullinan to be âdispassionateâ during a strategic review of Electraâs operations, given he serves as the primary liaison between the board and Electraâs fund manager. Mr. Cullinan started the private equity consulting business in Europe for Bain & Company and remains an adviser to the company. Through Sherborne, Mr. Bramson holds a stake of about 20 percent in Electra. On Monday, Electra said that the letter contained âunverifiable statements and unsubstantiated claimsâ and demonstrated a âconsiderable misunderstanding of how Electra works.â Shares of Electra rose less than 1 percent to Â£26.80 in trading in London on Wednesday morning.
