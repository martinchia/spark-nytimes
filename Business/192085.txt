Talk about a raise. Citigroupâs board raised the salary of Vikram S. Pandit, its chief executive, to an annual base of $1.75 million, from a symbolic $1 a year, according to a regulatory filing.   Mr. Pandit has been Wall Streetâs $1 man for a while now, after vowing in 2009 to receive an annual salary of just $1 until his firm returned to profitability. On Tuesday, Citigroup posted an annual profit in 2010, the first time it has done so since the financial crisis in 2008. “The board is very pleased with the progress that the company has made under Vikramâs leadership,” said Richard D. Parsons, chairman of the board of Citigroup, according to the filing. “Vikram has worked tirelessly to put Citi back on the right track, spearheading a restructuring that has returned the company to profitability and positioning the company for future growth. In light of these highly positive accomplishments, the base salary established for Vikram is merited.” Advertisement
