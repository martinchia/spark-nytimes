Synchrony Bank, the new name of GE Capital Retail Bank, settled claims of illegal credit card practices with the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Justice Department on Thursday and agreed to pay $225 million to consumers. The bank had been accused of illegal and discriminatory credit card practices that affected 746,000 consumers. The consumer bureau said the settlement was the federal governmentâs largest ever for credit card discrimination. Under the arrangement, GE Capital will refund $56 million to about 638,000 consumers who were subjected to deceptive marketing practices. And as part of the joint enforcement action by the consumer agency and the Justice Department, the bank is required to pay an additional $169 million to about 108,000 borrowers who were denied debt relief offers because of their national origin. “Todayâs action will provide $225 million in relief to GE Capital credit card customers who were harmed by deceptive marketing or discrimination,â said Richard Cordray, the bureau’s director. Jocelyn Samuels, the Justice Department’s acting assistant attorney for the civil rights division, added: “The blatant discrimination that occurred here is unlawful and will not be tolerated. Borrowers have the right to credit card terms that do not differ based on their national origin, and the settlement today sends the message that the Justice Department can and will vigorously enforce the law against lenders who violate that right.” The federal investigations were first disclosed by Synchrony Financial, the name adopted by G.E.’s consumer credit business on June 2, in documents it filed for an initial public offering. The company, which is based in Draper, Utah, and has more than $39 billion in assets, provides store-branded credit cards that are sold to consumers by retailers across the country. The investigation by the consumer protection bureau found that GE Capital Retail Bank marketed products promising debt cancellation of a percentage of the consumer’s balance in case of events like  involuntary unemployment or disability, but failed to disclose the precise requirements to be eligible for the cancellation and the fees involved. The bank also did not offer delinquent customers the possibility of paying off a portion of their debts if they asked to communicate in Spanish or had a mailing address in Puerto Rico — even if the customer met the promotionâs qualifications. This violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the investigation found.
