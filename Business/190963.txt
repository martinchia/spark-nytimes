Dell said  Tuesday that it had agreed to buy SonicWall, a privately held provider of data security measures for businesses, to continue expanding its corporate services offerings. The purchase price was undisclosed, but a person briefed on the matter told DealBook that Dell paid about $1.25 billion, including the assumption of SonicWall’s debt. Dell will gain a provider of high-grade networking security services, which include network firewalls, e-mail protection and backup and recovery offerings. SonicWall, which was founded in 1991, says it has more than 300,000 customers in 50 countries. In a nod to the highly litigious landscape increasingly found in the tech world, SonicWall noted that it holds more than 130 patents. âWe are building a strategic software portfolio to address the needs of our customers with key assets in the fast-growing and highly profitable I.T. security solutions business,” John Swainson, the president of Dell’s software group, said in a statement. âSonicWall gives Dell access to unique intellectual property resources and technology that position us well in fast growing parts of the software security business.â The deal will provide a hefty return for SonicWall’s majority owner, Thoma Bravo, the private equity firm. It bought a controlling stake in SonicWall in 2010 for about $717 million. (Of that, only $280 million was in cash, and the rest was borrowed money.) The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of Dell’s 2013 fiscal year. Dell was advised by the law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf, and SonicWall was advised by the law firm Kirkland & Ellis and Centerview Partners. Advertisement
