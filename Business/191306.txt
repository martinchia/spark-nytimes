JOS. A. BANK TO BUY PARENT OF EDDIE BAUER  |  Jos. A. Bank Clothiers said Friday morning that it had agreed to buy the parent company of Eddie Bauer in a deal valued at $825 million, including cash and debt. The purchase of Eddie Bauer, which comes amid the monthslong merger battle between Jos. A. Bank and Menâs Wearhouse, will be done with a combination of $564 million in cash and approximately 4.7 million new shares of common stock of Jos. A. Bank.   

 THE MAKINGS OF A CABLE BONANZA  |  Time Warner Cable had been ducking a takeover for months, so it may come as a surprise that its $42.5 billion merger with Comcast took shape in a matter of weeks. And in fact, Comcast was not intensely engaged with Time Warner Cable until about 10 days or so before the announcement of the acquisition, David Gelles writes in DealBook. 
Until the end of last weekend, Brian L. Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast, was in Sochi, Russia, for the Winter Olympics. From there, he âjuggled calls about the deal with a dinner hosted by the International Olympic Committee and attended by President Vladimir V. Putin, as well as meetings with the 2,700 NBC staff members on the ground,â Mr. Gelles writes. Meanwhile, the deal teams, including bankers from some of the biggest names on Wall Street, huddled in New York, speaking to Mr. Roberts by phone until he returned on Sunday. 
“On Monday and Tuesday, the two sides hashed out final details. Time Warner agreed to no breakup fee â unusual in a merger deal â in exchange for Comcast pledging to divest three million subscribers and extend net neutrality commitments, both viewed as olive branches to regulators,” Mr. Gelles writes. 
On Wednesday, a day before the deal announcement, Time Warner Cableâs board and management worked through a takeout dinner at the companyâs headquarters in the Time Warner Center, while members of Comcastâs board met with management nearby at 30 Rockefeller Center. The deal was done before the snowstorm hit New York City. In fact, some members of Time Warnerâs deal team managed to escape before the storm, with one boarding a flight to Miami and another jetting off to Aruba.



ON FORGOING A BREAKUP FEE  |  âComcastâs $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable has a lot of numbers that stand out. Among them is the breakup fee if either side walks away. That figure is zero,” Michael J. de la Merced writes in DealBook. The move could either reflect the companiesâ confidence that a deal will pass regulatory review or their commitment to seeing the transaction through. If regulators do block the deal, not having a breakup fee could work to Comcastâs advantage, Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. 



ON COMCASTâS MEDIA ASPIRATIONS  |  The deal âsolidifies Comcastâs reputation as an enterprise with grand, even audacious, ambitions,â Michael J. de la Merced and Bill Carter write in DealBook, adding, âThe move further establishes the reputation of Comcastâs chief executive, Brian L. Roberts, as a daring deal maker with expansive ambitions. A soft-spoken 54-year-old, he lacks the outsize personality of an executive like Rupert Murdoch but has nevertheless become an influential mogul.â
Comcast has a history of big deals, including the acquisition of AT&Tâs cable business for $47 billion 13 years ago, a $17.6 billion merger with Adelphia Communications in 2005 and a $30 billion deal for NBCUniversal that was completed less than a year ago. And Comcast shows no signs of stopping â just last month, the company suggested it planned to team up with a utility to sell electricity in Pennsylvania.



 ON THE REGULATORY SCRUTINY  |  Comcastâs proposed takeover of Time Warner Cable clearly raises the question of antitrust laws in the cable market. But the mergerâs effect on broadband Internet service is perhaps an even more important consideration for regulators, Edward Wyatt writes in DealBook. 
The combination of the two companies would control roughly 38 percent of the high-speed Internet market and account for nearly 32 million broadband customers, compared with 16 million for AT&T and nine million for Verizon. But on conference calls with analysts on Thursday, the companies defended the deal amid accusations that it would not get past regulatorsâ scrutiny of the combined companyâs dominant market share.
At least for Comcast, its confidence is not unfounded. Its chief lobbyist, David L. Cohen, is a major Democratic fund-raiser and has close ties to President Obama â he was a guest at the White House on Tuesday for the state dinner in honor of President FranÃ§ois Hollande of France. In addition, Comcast has connections to the regulatory agencies that will review the merger. Case in point: The current chairman of the Federal Communications Commission once served as the leader of the cable industryâs chief lobbying group.



WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING ABOUT THE DEAL  |  The deal is about infrastructure, not content (from Fortune): âThere wonât be a one model fits all, but the Comcast-Time Warner deal suggests that the pendulum of big media may be swinging back to infrastructure and not what flows through the pipes. And like always, Wall Street could be influencing that shift.â
The deal may be bad for America (from Bloomberg News): Comcast âhas its own built-in conflicts of interest: It will be serving the interests of its shareholders by keeping investments in its network as low as possible â in particular, making no move to provide the world-class fiber-optic connections that are now standard and cheap in other countries â and extracting as much rent as it can, in all kinds of ways.â
But it might also be good (From Quartz): âThe merger could help reset customer relationships. It comes at a good time, with Comcast actually adding TV subscribers for the first time in more than six years â thanks, the company claims, to a much-improved cable box that doesnât make you want to throw it out the window.â
On a lighter note, Slate drafted a (very fake) transcript of the last phone calls that led to the deal.

BATTLE OVER BANKER BONUSES BREWS IN LONDON  |  For many, bankingâs greatest draw is the promise of a hefty bonus. So when the European Union decided to limit bankers to bonuses equal to one or two times their salaries, bankers decided to fight back. Their weapon: bonuses in disguise. With these new pay packages â referred to by some as role-based pay and by others as âallowancesâ â global bank giants operating in London are hoping to sidestep the restrictions to ensure their top talent gets paid, Jenny Anderson and Peter Eavis write in DealBook.

They write: âAs the banks tie themselves in knots to comply with the bonus cap law, the new pay packages may undermine what bank regulators worldwide have sought to do for nearly six years: force banks to stagger the payment of bonuses over much longer periods. Such deferrals, as they are known on Wall Street, enable the money to be taken back if bets go bad.â

HAPPY VALENTINEâS DAY   |  Knowing a few things about economics can help make the love-filled holiday better, a Stanford professor says. In the meantime, tell someone you love them (even if itâs just for the day).

 BATTLE OVER BANKER BONUSES BREWS IN LONDON  |  For many, bankingâs greatest draw is the promise of a hefty bonus. So when the European Union decided to limit bankers to bonuses equal to one or two times their salaries, bankers decided to fight back. Their weapon: bonuses in disguise. With these new pay packages â referred to by some as role-based pay and by others as âallowancesâ â global bank giants operating in London are hoping to sidestep the restrictions to ensure their top talent gets paid, Jenny Anderson and Peter Eavis write in DealBook.
