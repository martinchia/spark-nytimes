BRITAIN TO EXAMINE COMPETITION IN BANKING  |  The Financial Conduct Authority of Britain said on Thursday that it planned to review whether competition was working properly in the corporate and investment banking sectors, DealBookâs Chad Bray reports. The regulator conducted a similar review of so-called wholesale securities and investment markets last year, and plans to consider looking at the asset management sector this year. The examination of competition in the wholesale financial markets found that limited clarity on the price and quality of services could make it difficult for clients to determine whether they were getting value for their money, and that cross-selling of services could make it difficult for new entrants or smaller firms to challenge existing players. The authority released a summary of its findings this month. The regulator said it intended to seek information for the banking study from inside the industry, trade groups and clients. The feedback received by the agency so far includes concerns about transparency, conflicts of interest and the impact of bundling services on competition, particularly on the ability of new firms to enter the market, the regulator said.  GREECE REQUESTS BAILOUT EXTENSION  |  Greece formally submitted its request for a six-month extension to its eurozone loan agreement on Thursday as it seeks to secure a new financing deal before its bailout program expires in a little more than a week, Reuters writes. Under its current bailout program, the country has received 240 billion euros, or about $274 billion, in exchange for pursuing various economic overhauls. Greece is proposing that the terms be different from its current bailout obligations, the official said. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, president of the group of finance ministers from euro area countries, confirmed that the request had been received. Senior eurozone officials are expected to hold a teleconference on Thursday to discuss the Greek request. If they are satisfied, then Eurogroup finance ministers will hold a conference call on Friday to conclude an agreement, eurozone sources said. The Greek situation continued to agitate investors on Thursday, with markets in Europe falling back from seven-year highs before rebounding on hopes of a Greek deal. Stocks in Asia closed mostly higher on Thursday, with Japanâs Nikkei 225 index ending the day up 0.36 percent and Hong Kongâs Hang Seng index up 0.19 percent.  SPOTLIGHT ON SECRETIVE BANKING FAMILY  |  Two recent deals â for a London office tower known as the Gherkin and for Chiquita Brands International, the banana producer â have drawn unusual attention to the Safra Group, the investment arm of a financial family that strives for secrecy, David Gelles and Dan Horch report in DealBook. In addition to the familyâs vast and growing real estate holdings, its fortune is bolstered by a network of international banks, including Safra National Bank of New York. In total, the family and its banks have more than $200 billion under management, and stockholder equity of more than $15 billion. “With the latest deals, the Gherkin became the face of a Safra real estate portfolio, which includes over 100 properties around the globe, including the 660 Madison Avenue office complex in Midtown Manhattan, and several prime locations in SoHo in Lower Manhattan,â Mr. Gelles and Mr. Horch write. âIn Chiquita, the Safra Group saw the opportunity to diversify its revenues with a similarly long-term, and public, bet.â By joining with the Cutrale Group, owned by a Brazilian family, Safra was able to branch out without taking on too much risk. Despite the familyâs prominence, Joseph Safra â who runs the Safra Group and is the last surviving son of the patriarch who built the familyâs initial fortune â and his relatives “are resolutely private,â Mr. Gelles and Mr. Horch write. âHe does not appear in gossip columns and his name has not been associated with politicians or celebrities. In contrast to Brazilâs casual customs, he always wears a suit. Observant of his Sephardic Jewish roots, he keeps a strict kosher diet.â No member of the Safra family or its companies would comment for this article, following a longstanding policy of not speaking to the news media or making public appearances, they add.

UBER EXPANDS FINANCING ROUND  |  Facing overwhelming demand from institutional investors, the popular ride-sharing start-up Uber has expanded its Series E round of venture financing by $1 billion, bringing the total capacity for the round to $2.8 billion, Mike Isaac writes in DealBook. The move, outlined in documents filed on Wednesday with the Delaware secretary of state and confirmed by Uber, occurred just weeks after the company closed a $1.2 billion round of financing. At the time, Uber said it had left capacity for about $600 million in additional strategic investments. “The appetite for a piece of Uber has proved to be greater than the company had imagined,â Mr. Isaac writes. The $600 million was quickly oversubscribed, and Uber decided to raise the amount. Baidu, the Chinese Internet giant, accounts for part of the additional investment beyond the $1.2 billion round. The most recent expansion is on top of some $4 billion Uber raised, including a recent $1.6 billion round of convertible debt financing from the clients of the private wealth arm of Goldman Sachs, the investment bank previously confirmed. Uberâs $40 billion valuation remains unchanged since the company announced the first part of the round in December.    |  Contact: @melbournecoal | E-mail  Rexam Board to Recommend Investors Accept Ball Takeover Offer  |  The deal would combine two of the worldâs largest makers of drink cans in a merger expected to result in $300 million in annual cost savings by 2018.
