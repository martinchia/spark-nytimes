Morgan Stanley, which has not had much joy in a rough year for Wall Street, had reason to celebrate on Wednesday. As the lead underwriter on Facebookâs initial public offering, the firm will reap not only millions of dollars in fees, but more important, the bragging rights that come with what bankers described as a once-in-a-generation event. At Facebook, it had been clear for some time that Morgan Stanley would help shepherd the company to the public markets. The Wall Street firm had led the prominent I.P.O.âs of LinkedIn, Groupon and Zynga. And Michael Grimes, the leader of Morgan Stanleyâs office in Menlo Park, Calif., had steered the firmâs tech team through the dot-com bust and forged relationships with the venture capital firms that have incubated todayâs tech giants. So a vexing question for Facebook executives as they prepared to go public was: What sort of role should go to Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanleyâs chief rival in winning I.P.O. assignments? Goldmanâs reputation has taken serious hits in recent years. A series of events, from a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit in 2010 that accused the firm of creating a mortgage product that was intended to fail to Goldmanâs handling of a $1.5 billion investment in Facebook itself last year, have led to criticism of the firm. Facebook executives, say people briefed on the matter, weighed how the bankâs record might affect its own reputation. So while many people still expected Goldman to be the runner-up among underwriters, it was JPMorgan Chase that took the No. 2 spot in the Facebook prospectusâs listing on Wednesday. It was surprising given that JPMorgan is relatively untested in leading technology I.P.O.âs, but helps illustrate the firmâs rise in recent years. The bank had played a full-court press to win over Facebook, with its chief executive, Jamie Dimon, forming a rapport with Facebookâs chief operating office, Sheryl Sandberg. The bankâs top deal-maker, James B. Lee Jr., meanwhile, regularly led pitches to Facebook executives.  One advantage was JPMorganâs strength as a lender, having helped create a credit facility that provided Facebook with ample cash.  Still, the banks were in the dark about whether they stood in Facebookâs good graces until a few weeks ago. Three other firms round out the underwriting syndicate so far: Bank of America–Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital and Allen & Company. In a show of support for their prospective client, bankers from the top three underwriters had set up Facebook accounts, despite firm policies banning the use of social networks at the office. âThis is a great thing for peopleâs tech practices,â Peter Falvey, a managing director at Morgan Keegan, said. âItâs such a unique asset and such a highly anticipated offering that it has significant franchise value.â Such is Facebookâs prominence that banks are willing to work for a much lower fee than usual. The company is expected to pay its advisers a fee as low as 1 percent of proceeds raised, according to a person briefed on the matter. That would be far below the norm of 3 to 7 percent, though the size of Facebookâs offering guarantees a still-handsome payout. That low fee is reminiscent of what General Motors paid in its âre-I.P.O.â in the fall of 2010: an eye-popping 0.75 percent. There, however, the selling shareholder was the federal government. With an expected valuation of $75 billion to $100 billion, Facebook will be among the biggest companies to seek the public markets in recent memory. Recent trades on Sharespost, a secondary market for Facebook stock, valued the company at as much as $89 billion. Even with a fund-raising target of $5 billion â a preliminary figure that will almost surely grow over time â Facebookâs offering is more than twice as big as Googleâs $1.9 billion initial offering nearly eight years ago. The road to landing a coveted underwriting role began years ago, according to people briefed on the matter. It meant forming relationships with Facebookâs co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, who viewed Wall Street bankers with some skepticism.  It also meant winning over top executives like Ms. Sandberg and Facebookâs finance chief, David Ebersman, who would oversee the I.P.O. process. Bankers also courted influential Facebook investors like James W. Breyer of Accel Partners and Yuri Milner of DST Global. Bankers and analysts had long assumed Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs were the front-runners. Together, the two firms underwrote nearly 14 percent of I.P.O.âs worldwide last year, raising $22.3 billion in proceeds for their clients, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Goldman ranked first, with 54 offerings that raised $11.9 billion.  Yet within Silicon Valley, Morgan Stanley has a nearly matchless reputation. In making their pitch to Facebook to be lead underwriter, Morgan Stanley bankers promoted their firmâs ability to sell huge amounts of stock through its retail brokerage network â an ability that appealed to Facebook, according to a person briefed on the matter.  Goldman had its own cards to play, having also worked on Groupon and Zynga. It also led a $500 million investment in Facebook last year and sold an additional $1 billion worth of stock to wealthy foreign private clients. But the latter led to embarrassing questions about potential securities regulation violations, hamstringing Goldmanâs efforts. Evelyn M. Rusli contributed reporting.
