Federal prosecutors did not show much leniency in asking a federal judge to sentence Michael Steinberg, a onetime top trader for Steven A. Cohenâs hedge fund, SAC Capital Advisors, to more than five years in prison for insider trading on stock tips. Prosecutors asked Judge Richard J. Sullivan of Federal District Court in Manhattan to sentence Mr. Steinberg on Friday to five years, three months, to six and a half years, a longer prison term than the one recommended by the probation department for court. The department recommended that Judge Sullivan sentence Mr. Steinberg to four years, three months, to five years, three months in prison. The sentence recommendation by prosecutors with Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for Manhattan, is more than double the two-year sentence requested by Mr. Steinbergâs lawyers. It is also greater than the prison sentences meted out to 50 other former traders and analysts who have either pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial in the federal governmentâs more than six-year crackdown on insider trading in the hedge fund industry. The sentencing memo for Mr. Steinberg was filed late Friday. The request for significant prison time for Mr. Steinberg, convicted in December of generating $1.8 million in illegal profits for Mr. Cohenâs firm, is an indication that prosecutors will show no mercy at next monthâs sentencing of Mathew Martoma, another former SAC portfolio manager convicted of insider trading. Mr. Martoma, scheduled to be sentenced on June 10, was convicted in February of generating profits and avoiding losses totaling $275 million for Mr. Cohenâs onetime $14 billion firm, in what the authorities called one of the biggest insider trading cases ever charged. But the sentencing on Friday of Mr. Steinberg, who worked alongside Mr. Cohen for longer than Mr. Martoma or the six other former SAC employees criminally charged and convicted in the investigation, is not likely to be the last chapter in his prosecution. Within days of the sentencing, Mr. Steinbergâs lawyers are expected to file an appeal and raise a legal challenge similar to the one that seemed last month to get a favorable hearing from a three-judge appellate panel. During a contentious oral argument,  the panel signaled that it had serious issues with the jury instructions given by Judge Sullivan in a related insider trading prosecution involving Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson. The two men were portfolio managers at other hedge funds, but traded on some of the same inside tips as Mr. Steinberg. The appellate panel appeared to side with the defense lawyers for Mr. Newman and Mr. Chiasson, who argued that Judge Sullivan erred when he failed to instruct the jury that it had to find whether traders knew the person providing inside information had received some sort of a benefit. The appellate judges also castigated federal prosecutors working for Mr. Bharara for getting Mr. Steinbergâs trial assigned to Judge Sullivan as a related case, even though Mr. Steinberg was charged months after Mr. Chiasson and Mr. Newman were convicted. The appellate judges suggested that prosecutors wanted Judge Sullivan to try Mr. Steinberg because he is jurist with a reputation for siding with law enforcement in criminal cases. Prosecutors have argued that it made sense for Judge Sullivan to try all three men because they were part of the same âcriminal clubâ who were beneficiaries of illegal corporate secrets involving technology companies like computer manufacturer Dell and the chip maker Nvidia. Judge Sullivan sentenced Mr. Chiasson to six and a half years in prison and Mr. Newman to four and a half years. Legal experts have said that if the appellate court orders a new trial for Mr. Chiasson and Mr. Newman, it is likely that Mr. Steinberg will succeed on appeal as well. On Monday, the federal judge presiding over a civil lawsuit filed by the Â Securities and Exchange Commission against Mr. Steinberg, agreed to stay that proceeding until the appellate court issued a ruling on criminal verdicts against Mr. Chiasson and Mr. Newman. In a joint letter to Â Judge Harold Baer Jr. of the Federal District Court in Manhattan, lawyers for Mr. Steinberg and the agency asked the judge to take the civil lawsuit off his August trial calender and wait for the appellate court to issue it ruling. Barry Berke, the lawyer for Mr. Steinberg, wrote in the May 8 letter that “if the Second Circuit reverses or vacates the convictions of Messrs. Newman and Chiasson, it likely will grant the same relief to Mr. Steinberg after his conviction is entered and appealed.” It did not take much to persuade Judge Baer. In a brief, handwritten order, the judge wrote: “Let’s not make this more complicated than necessary,” and put the matter off until the appellate court rules in the case involving Mr. Newman and Mr. Chiasson.
