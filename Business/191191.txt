Airbnb is said to have closed a $475 million round of financing from a group led by TPG Growth that values the home-sharing company at about $10 billion, Michael J. de la Merced writes in DealBook. At the value assigned by the investment, Airbnb â a website and app where homeowners and apartment dwellers rent their homes, spare rooms or couches to travelers â would be worth more than some established hotel chains like Wyndham Worldwide or Hyatt. Airbnb is also set to meet New York Stateâs attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, in court this week related to a subpoena filed last fall “to identify bad actors and illegal activity on the platform,” according to TechCrunch. The state is looking to crack down on hosts operating multiple listings.  GOLDMAN, CITI … AND A GUY IN AN OFFICE Â |Â  âAnyone looking at the mergers and acquisitions âleague tablesâ â the Wall Street equivalent of Major League Baseballâs standings â during this hot year for merger activity would find the usual suspects: Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs vying for the top spot, with other brand-name firms jockeying to fill the coveted top 10,â James B. Stewart writes in the Common Sense column. âAnd then, at No. 11, thereâs Paul J. Taubman.â “Mr. Taubman has single-handedly accounted for $175 billion in deals over the last year, which has had Wall Street bankers buzzing with a mix of admiration and envy,â Mr. Stewart writes, adding, âAlthough Mr. Taubmanâs feat is unusual, he may be part of a fledgling trend toward merger and acquisition microfirms, or, as in his case, sole practitioners.â In Mr. Taubmanâs case, his lofty ranking is based on two giant deals: Verizonâs $130 billion acquisition of Vodafoneâs stake in Verizon Wireless â the biggest single deal of 2013 â and Comcastâs $45 billion attempt to take over Time Warner Cable.  SOTHEBYâS POISON PILL Â |Â  The so-called poison pill was invented in the 1980s to fight off hostile raiders. But now, Sothebyâs â the auction house that has become a target for a number of hedge funds, including Daniel S. Loebâs Third Point â has adopted a low-threshold poison pill âclearly aimed at the hedge funds, and Mr. Loeb in particular,â Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. Third Point is running a proxy contest to replace three of Sothebyâs directors. Sothebyâs poison pill sets two limits for ownership â a 20 percent limit for passive investors like mutual funds and a 10 percent threshold for activist shareholders. Third Point sued Sothebyâs in Delaware Chancery Court in March, challenging the poison pill as illegal because it limited the hedge fundâs ability to buy more shares and so have a greater likelihood of winning the proxy contest. “The question now is whether the old cases upholding the poison pill will still apply in the case of activism. This is the fundamental question in the Sothebyâs case,â Mr. Davidoff writes. âIn a hostile takeover, the company is about to undergo a change of control that will end its independence.â He adds: âBut with shareholder activism, the issue is about steering the future direction of the company, not eliminating shareholders or the company itself. The companyâs future independence or survival is not the primary question.â  ON THE AGENDA Â |Â  The index of leading indicators for March is out at 10 a.m. Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network interviews Mayor Bill de Blasio at 9 a.m. Netflix reports first-quarter earnings.  LATEST FIGHT ON VOLCKER RULE Â |Â  The fight over the Volcker Rule rages on. The latest battle involves an instrument known as the collateralized loan obligation, which big banks want to be allowed to own but which regulators say can be hazardous and may allow the banks to evade the Volcker Ruleâs prohibition on risky trading. The rule was an attempt by lawmakers to reinstate taxpayer protections lost when Congress gutted the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, but the big bank crowd contends that the regulators have overreached, Gretchen Morgenson writes in the Fair Game column. Ms. Morgenson writes: âUnder the rule, banks are not allowed to have ownership stakes or relationships with hedge funds or private equity firms. Many C.L.O.s are issued and overseen by hedge funds and private equity firms, though, making C.L.O.s just the kind of trading vehicles the Volcker Rule intended to exorcise from bank balance sheets.â Banks cannot own C.L.O.s if they contain bonds, equity interests or other assets, but can hold them if they contain only commercial loans throughout the holding period. Some have called the Volcker Rule a job destroyer, arguing that it will cause small banks to make layoffs if they have to divest these riskier assets. Small banks, however, do not own large amounts of this paper, though their big bank brethren do, Ms. Morgenson writes. And the divestiture of these holdings would not cause immense losses, regulators say. âClearly, large and interconnected banks like the status quo  â a safety net that will rescue them if their bets go bad,â Ms. Morgenson adds. âWhat is equally clear, though, is that taxpayers deserve better.â     Â |Â  Contact: @melbournecoal | E-mail    Sign up for the DealBook Newsletter, delivered every morning and afternoon.   Comcastâs Real Repairman Â |Â  David L.
