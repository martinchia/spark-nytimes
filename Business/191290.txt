The Finnish financial company OP-Pohjola Group said on Thursday that it had offered to buy the shares it does not already own in Pohjola Bank for about 3.4 billion euros, or about $4.6 billion. The bank’s directors are expected to evaluate the cash offer and make an announcement by Feb. 14. The offer will run through April 1. OP-Pohjola and its related entities own about 55.4 percent of the outstanding shares of Pohjola Bank and control about 75.8 percent of the voting rights. The group is offering â¬16.80 a share for Pohjola Bank, or â¬3.4 billion in total. That is 18 percent above the bank’s closing share price of â¬14.23 on Wednesday. The group said it was seeking to streamline its structure and decision-making processes to address tighter financial regulations.
