The Lonza Group, a Swiss supplier of pharmaceutical ingredients seeking to diversify its product lineup, said on Monday that it had agreed to buy Arch Chemicals for $1.2 billion in cash. With the acquisition of Arch Chemicals, which is based in Norwalk, Conn., Lonza is buying a maker of chemicals used to kill microorganisms like bacteria and fungi.   The transaction “will allow us to expand our non-pharma life science business to achieve a well-balanced profile based upon two world-leading growth businesses — pharmaceutical contract manufacturing and microbial control,” Stefan Borgas, Lonza’s chief executive, said in the statement.  Lonza is bidding $47.20 a share for Arch, 36.7 percent above the company’s average share price over the last month.   Shares of Arch Chemicals have risen to a $42.17 closing price on Friday from a low last month of $32.72, an increase of almost 29 percent. They climbed $4.27, or 11.2 percent, on Friday alone, and rose $4.75, or 11.3 percent, to $46.92 in premarket trading in New York on Monday.  Lonza’s tender offer is to commence on Friday, and the company hopes to close the deal later this year, pending the acceptance of two-thirds of Arch shareholders, as well as regulatory approval. The company anticipates annual cost savings of $50 million within two years of closing the deal, which it plans to finance entirely with debt. Arch, whose products are used in hygiene and water treatment, employs about 3,000 people in 23 facilities worldwide; it reported revenue of $1.4 billion last year. The global market for microbial control products, which is growing at 4 to 6 percent a year, is valued at about $10 billion, Lonza said. Lonza hired JPMorgan as its financial adviser, and Jenner & Block as legal counsel. Arch Chemicals was advised by Morgan Stanley and Cravath Swain & Moore. Advertisement
