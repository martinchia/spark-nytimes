Portraits of women entrepreneurs. At the last She Owns It business group meeting, we talked about governmentâs impact on small businesses. Jessica Johnson, who owns Johnson Security Bureau, had recently traveled to Washington to attend a conference led by the U.S. Black Chamber. Ms. Johnson said one of the most valuable experiences of her trip was going to lunch with a group of successful small-business owners. âThe majority of people at the table had multimillion-dollar businesses â and you donât hear those stories all the time â people that were doing well in spite of the economy, in spite of regulations, from different parts of the country,â she said. âIn years past I never knew they were out there.â During the lunch meeting, Ms. Johnson said the owners exchanged information about their businesses, exploring ways in which they might work together. Ms. Johnson was particularly interested in talking with the owner of a company that does information-technology security and with a consultant to the Department of Homeland Security who handles international security. âWeâre in different spaces within the industry, but thereâs still potential for us all to work together,â she said. She and her security-industry peers said they often hear about, and pass up, contract opportunities that fall outside their specific areas of focus. Now, however, they may share these leads with each other or, perhaps, bid on projects together.   The conference also gave Ms. Johnson the chance to learn about various government programs that could help her business. She was particularly interested in aÂ Department of LaborÂ programÂ established to help retrain people displaced from other industries. The program might benefit Johnson Security if, for example, a prospective client wanted to install security cameras instead of having guards on site. With this program she could train employees to install and use the cameras. Beth Shaw, who owns YogaFit, asked who pays for the training. âYou pay a portion,â Ms. Johnson said, but the Small Business Administration can help offset the cost. Alexandra Mayzler, who owns Thinking Caps Group, said she was intrigued by the opportunities but was skeptical about their implementation, especially the amount of paperwork that might be required. âMy concern is that when you then try to put it into practice you literally need to dedicate a human to getting all the checks in the right boxes,â she said. For example, she said, she would very much like to become a New York City Board of Education vendor â if she could find the time to navigate the requirements. The city’s boardÂ of education provides certain educational services, like tutoring, to students who donât have access to them at school, she explained. While the school boardÂ pays at a lower rate than Thinking Capsâ private clients, Ms. Mayzler said, the work could be worthwhile because of its consistency. âIt could be an arm of the business that would make a lot of sense,â she said. And, sheâd love to be able to help more students. (Thinking Caps currently offers its services on a sliding scale to about 10 percent of its clients.) But she hasnât had time to figure out the process required to get the school board’sÂ stamp of approval. Thereâs another aspect to the red tape that troubles Ms. Mayzler. She said many board-approved tutoring companies donât do a good job. âThey can get away with it,” she said, “because once youâre approved, Iâm not really sure how you get unapproved.â She added that parents have called her, described subpar services, and said, âPlease go get yourself into this program because we really want to work with you.â âHave you considered bringing a former Department of Ed educator on board to help you with this?â Ms. Johnson asked. âThey might know enough people and know the ins and outs of the system to at least get your foot in the door.” Ms. Mayzler said that was a good idea. However, she added, âI donât want to add people right now because Iâm still very cautious about how to build a team.â Her concerns were highlighted by the departure of an employee she hired â just this summer â to handle business development. So, while it might sound logical to address the New York City Board of Education challenge by adding to her staff, she noted that hiring is no easy task. Any suggestions?
