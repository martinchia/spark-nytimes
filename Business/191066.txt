LONDON â The Co-operative Bank said on Friday that it would cancel 4.97 million pounds, or about $8.38 million, in bonuses for current and former executives and other employees as the British lender reported a Â£1.3 billion pretax annual loss. The embattled bank said the bonuses would not paid under deferred compensation plans as a result of performance benchmarks not being met and “in light of recent events.” The bank did not name the executives, but said it would withhold bonuses from a pool of 43 senior managers and employees in risk-taking functions on deferred compensation awarded from 2010 to 2012. Co-operative Bank also said in its annual report that it plans to recoup money paid to Paul Flowers, its former chairman and a Methodist minister, when he left the bank last year.Â Mr. Flowers was set to receive Â£95,000 in three payments following his departure and received one of those payments, the bank said. The lender was forced to seek a capital infusion from a group of bondholders last year to avoid a collapse after it discovered a Â£1.5 billion capital shortfall. Last month, the lender said it would have to bolster its balance sheet by another Â£400 million. On Friday, Co-operative Bank warned that it did not expect to make a profit in 2014 or 2015 and said that it was focused on reshaping its business and shoring up its capital position. âDuring 2013, the task for the new management was to keep the bank alive,â Niall Booker, the bankâs chief executive, said in a statement. The capital-raising âprevented the bank from going into resolution, preserving the bank for our customers and protecting jobs without cost to the taxpayer. However, there continue to be significant issues, which need to be resolved,â he said. To avoid collapse last year, the bank agreed to a debt restructuring in which a 70 percent stake was relinquished to a group of bondholders, including the hedge funds Silver Point Capital and Aurelius Capital Management. After the restructuring, the Co-operative Group, the bank’s parent company, is the bankâs largest shareholder, with a 30 percent stake. The Co-operative Group traces its roots to the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers, a cooperative company formed in 1844 that paid a share of its profit back to its members as a dividend. The group provides a range of products and services, including operating grocery stores, funeral homes, pharmacies, an insurance company, legal services providers and the banking unit. The Co-operative Bankâs financial difficulties can be traced back to its acquisition of Britannia Building Society, a local rival, in 2009. The merger left the bank with a large pool of delinquent commercial real estate loans. A deal to buy part of the Lloyds Banking Groupâs branch network collapsed last year, shortly before Cooperative Bank’s financial problems came to light. The Â£1.3 billion pretax annual loss for 2013 included credit impairments of Â£516 million, conduct and legal risk costs of Â£412 million and Â£148 million write down related to information technology. On an after-tax basis, including the proceeds of the capital infusion, the bank posted a loss of Â£748.9 million in 2013, compared with a loss of Â£509.1 million in the prior year. In November, The Mail on Sunday, a British tabloid, reported that Mr. Flowers, the former chairman, was covertly filmed counting out money to buy illegal drugs just days after he appeared before Parliament to answer questions about his leadership at the bank. Mr. Flowers, who left the bank in June, has apologized for his âstupid and wrongâ behavior. He has been suspended by the church and was arrested as part of a police inquiry in November. On Friday, the bank said that Mr. FlowersÂ was in breach of an agreement under which he left the bankÂ in June. The bank said that it was trying to get back the firstÂ Â£95,000 payment and that it does not intend to pay the remaining two installments.  After joining the bank as chief executive in June, Mr. Booker received Â£1.7 million in compensation in his first six months on the job, including a base salary of Â£699,000. Advertisement
