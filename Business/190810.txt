Your business in a photo. We recently asked small-business owners to send us photographs that capture the soul of their businesses in a single shot. This one comes from Paul Uhlir of Add3 in Seattle: Add3 is the name of our business. We are a search marketing agency located in the heart of Seattle. I love this picture. To me it captures all that is great about being a small, independent business. This was taken on a Friday. Young, Eager, Ready to take on the world, happy to be our own bosses! (another picture could show all the stresses but letâ€™s not dwell on those.) You can see more Small Picture photos here. Can you capture your business in a single photo? If so, please submit it here. You're the Boss offers an insider's perspective on small-business ownership. It gives business owners a place where they can compare notes, ask questions, get advice, and learn from one another's mistakes. The blog also offers analysis of policy issues, and suggests investing tips.
