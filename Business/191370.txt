International politicians and regulators urged the United Nations on Thursday to add a new item to its already packed agenda: speculative commodities trading.  Leonel Fernandez, president of the Dominican Republic, will propose to the United Nations General Assembly this week a resolution that would limit large trading positions, among other regulatory measures. Mr. Fernandez, speaking at an United Nations panel on Thursday, blamed Wall Street speculation for major fluctuations in food and oil prices. âThis is a major problem for our economy and our citizens,â he said.  But past efforts to rein in speculative trading have stalled.  Over the last few years, as Wall Street has ramped up its speculation in the futures market, the prices of the underlying commodities have gyrated wildly, ultimately hitting consumers at the gas pump and in the supermarket.  The Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulatory overhaul enacted last year, requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to limit the amount of futures contracts that a single trader or firm can hold on certain commodities.  The so-called position limits plan has emerged as one of the most contentious matters at the agency, which received some 13,000 public comment letters on the issue. Indeed, Wall Street has moved to tame the plan, dispatching an army of lawyers and lobbyists to the agency.   âThere are people out there who are violently opposed,â Bart Chilton, a Democratic member of the commodity commission, said at the United Nations panel on Thursday.  He noted that some groups are threatening legal challenges to the rules. Dodd-Frank leaves it up to the agency to enforce potion limits âas appropriate.â Some Wall Street firms have interpreted the fine print to mean that, in fact, no limits are appropriate.  âPeople are trying to dance on the head of a legal pin,â Mr. Chilton said.   While the limits were supposed to kick in during January, the agency has not yet finalized the plan. It is planning to meet in early October to vote on an updated version of the rules.  For now, the agency is considering a plan to enact trading limits on 28 commodities â oil, wheat, corn and the like. Existing position limits apply to only nine items. The Dominican Republic will urge the United Nations to adopt a similar regulatory overhaul that includes position limits and requirements that Wall Street firms post more margin when trading.  âIf we were talking about commodities like botox, Red Bull and Twinkies â who cares?” said former Senator Byron Dorgan, a Democrat from North Dakota who pushed to include position limits in Dodd-Frank. âBut weâre talking about food and energy, things that everyone needs.â Advertisement
