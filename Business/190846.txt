Dynegy Inc. announced on Friday that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York, the latest step to restructure the ailing energy company and settle with creditors who hold more than $2.5 billion in claims over one of its subsidiaries. The plan calls for the parent company to merge with Dynegy Holdings, a subsidiary that is already in bankruptcy, the Houston company said in a statement. The plan came about after the company transferred valuable assets – a set of coal-firing power plants – from the subsidiary to the parent company, prompting an outcry from creditors and a bankruptcy examiner to the accuse the company of “fraudulent” behavior. The proposed settlement deal grants creditors in Dynegy Holdings 99 percent of the stock in the reorganized company once it emerges from bankruptcy. The remaining 1 percent goes to shareholders, who will also receive five-year warrants to buy 13.5 percent of the common stock.   In its announcement, the company said other subsidiaries that own and operate coal-fired and gas-fired businesses are not part of Friday’s bankruptcy filing, having been separately financed last year.
