RIO DE JANEIRO â This may seem to be an inopportune time to invest in Brazil.  Inflation is an increasing concern. Interest rates have risen. Fiscal accounts have deteriorated, and the countryâs stock market returns are down for the year. Yet, the private equity sector has been not pulling back on the country. The Carlyle Group is said to have just raised a new private equity fund for Brazil. Advent International last week acquired its third Brazilian company this year, up from just one last year. And the private equity firm General Atlantic backed the countryâs lone initial public offering this year. Though the backdrop of Brazilâs economy remains weak, private equity firms say this is a good time to get in, betting that things cannot get much worse. âIf you have money, you should find some good deals,â said Christopher Meyn, a partner with  GÃ¡vea Investments, who expects much consolidation to take place among Brazilian companies in the near term. A weak I.P.O. market can benefit private equity firms at least when entering investments. When Brazil was a darling among emerging markets — it had 64 I.P.O.s in 2007 — until 2012, numerous young companies went public. Many subsequently struggled, most famously those founded by the onetime billionaire Eike Batista.  âOur biggest competitor is a pre-mature I.P.O.,â said General Atlanticâs head of Latin America and managing director, Martin Escobari.  Although Brazilâs growth was negligible last year and contracted in the first two quarters of this year and was merely 0.1 percent in the third quarter, an upside emerged.  âYouâre seeing lots of opportunities of failed or challenged I.P.O.s  that are trading well below fair value, so opportunities arise out of dislocation capital,â Mr. Escobari said. Still, the outlook remains challenging. Economists surveyed by nationâs central bank predicted growth for 2014 to come in at an anemic 0.13 percent. Next year doesnât look much better, with just 0.55 percent forecast. In spite of such issues, private equity has been keeping itself anchored in promising companies. A new Carlyle fund has raised about 700 million reais, or $280 million, with a second close expected within weeks, according to a person briefed on the matter. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information was private. The size of the fund could slightly increase in January, the person said, before a final close. Although the amount is less than the $1 billion reais the firm hoped to raise when it began, it exceeds the firmâs first Brazil fund in 2011 of 360 million reais, or $225 million at exchange rates at the time.  Several other firms also raised new funds this year. Advent, in addition to increased deal-making, said last month that it raised a new $2.1 billion Latin America fund, just exceeding its goal, which will largely focus on Brazil.  This month, GÃ¡vea Investments, owned by J.P. Morgan Asset Management since 2010, made a final close on a new $1.1 billion fund. DealBook reported in July that it had secured such capital commitments. Anecdotally, fund-raising appears to be up this year compared to 2013, though it is still down from the boom years of 2010 and 2011.  Other private equity funds stayed committed as well. Those include General Atlantic, which invests from its global fund based in the United States. General Atlantic also has made well-performing investments amid tough times.  Brazil had only one I.P.O. in 2014, a business backed by General Atlantic. Weeks before the offering, the investment firm provided  200 million reais, or $80 million, to  the veterinary medicine company, Ouro Fino SaÃºde Animal ParticipaÃ§Ãµes, as an anchor investor for a minority stake on the condition that it go public.  Since its I.P.O. on Oct. 21, the veterinary medicine companyâs shares are up about 14 percent. That I.P.O. would not have taken place without General Atlanticâs backing, according to several people who were briefed on the matter. The Ouro Fino investment was similar to one General Atlantic made last year, also a tough one for Brazilâs economy. It provided an anchor investment of approximately $200 million to the airline loyalty program Smiles, controlled by Gol, that allowed the loyalty program to go public.  Since its first day of trading in April 2013, Smilesâ share price has risen 112 percent, making it one of Brazilâs best-performing stocks recently. (General Atlantic exercised its option to buy additional shares in the company this year).  But I.P.O. exits for private equity firms may still be a ways off.  Many of Brazilâs fastest growing companies have revenue of less than $400 million, and so âare very far from achieving the required size to access the I.P.O. market,â said Daniel Wainstein, managing director at Greenhill & Co., an investment bank.  Access to long-term credit or debt remains scarce for these companies looking to expand. That is particularly true in the sectors of animal health, education, healthcare and information technology, and often involves family-run businesses. Private equity then may be one of the few remaining avenues of capital for high-growth companies, Mr. Wainstein and others in the industry say. âThat fundamental has not changed at all,â said Cesar Collier, managing director of Siguler Guff, a private equity firm that has long been active in Brazil, investing in at least a dozen private equity funds.  âIt is not all about the macro. It is also about the micro,â he said. Advertisement
