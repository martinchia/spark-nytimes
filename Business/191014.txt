 Updated, 5:20 p.m. |  Shares of Arista Networks, a California-based maker of high-speed computer networking equipment, jumped in their debut on Friday after pricing well above their expected range. Arista Networks sold 5.25 million shares at $43 each, raising $226 million. The pricing was greater than the company’s previous range of $36 to $40 a share and valued the company at $2.75 billion.  That valuation surged on Friday when Arista Networks’ shares surged above $59, or more than 37 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange, where they trade under the symbol “ANET.” Shares eventually closed at $55. âI do think this company is in a great growth period right now,â said Brian Marshall, an analyst with ISI, who set a $60 price target. Arista Networks, which was founded in 2004, has pioneered some of the high-speed computer products that have advanced so-called cloud technology, which acts as a virtual storage locker for electronic data. The company also has an impressive pedigree in the technology world: One of its founders, Andreas Bechtolsheim, is also a co-founder of Sun Microsystems and was the first big investor in Google.  But Arista only shipped its first products in 2008 and listed its short history as a risk factor for potential investors in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  âOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects, including our ability to plan for and model future growth,â the company said in its prospectus. That history is short, but it may still impress investors. Arista reported more than $360 million in revenue last year, a nearly 90 percent jump from 2012, although it warned in its prospectus that its âgrowth in recent periods may not be indicative of future performance.â The money Arista raises from its I.P.O. could help it compete with larger competitors like Cisco, which dominates the Ethernet switch space. âThis provides them growth capital to accelerate their hiring plan,â Mr. Marshall said. âTheyâll be able to become a larger company even faster.â In its S.E.C. filings, Arista said that its growth strategy would include increasing investment in research and development and selling additional products and services to its customers.  A spokeswoman from Arista declined to make anyone from the company available for comment. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and RBC Capital Markets were the companyâs underwriters.  Advertisement
