7:17 p.m. | Updated  Barclays on Tuesday reported a drop in profit for last year but still beat analystsâ expectations, having reduced losses from bad loans and almost doubled earnings at its investment bank. Shares of Barclays shot up 5.8 percent in London. Profit fell to Â£3.6 billion ($5.7 billion) in 2010, from $15.1 billion a year earlier. The 2009 figure was inflated, however, by a one-time gain of $10.1 billion from the sale of Barclays Global Investors. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News had predicted 2010 profit of $5.1 billion. Like its rivals, Barclays has changed the way it rewards its staff members as a result of new regulations for bonuses. The bank said on Tuesday that bonus awards for 2010 fell 7 percent at the group and 12 percent at Barclays Capital, its investment banking division. It said that it also âexpanded significantlyâ the number of employees whose bonuses would be 60 percent deferred. Write-downs for troubled assets dropped 30 percent, to $9.1 billion from $13 billion, after credit losses at Barclays Capital improved over all, although the quality of the bankâs corporate loan portfolio in Spain deteriorated sharply. âI am proud of what we achieved in 2010, especially our profit growth and enhanced capital and liquidity positions,â said the chief executive, Robert E. Diamond Jr., who took the helm at the British bank this year. Barclays Capital, the bankâs main driver for growth, had a profit before tax of $7.7 billion in 2010, up from $4 billion a year earlier. Referring to tougher rules being adopted for banks in Britain and elsewhere, Mr. Diamond, like his counterparts at other big banks, warned that âthe new environment will necessitate lower returns than the period just preceding the recent crisis.â But he said Barclays aimed to reach a return on equity of at least 13 percent by 2013. Mr. Diamond said he would review the bankâs portfolio of assets and find ways to cut operating costs to achieve that goal. Staff costs rose 20 percent, to $19.1 billion from $15.9 billion in 2009, of which bonuses accounted for $5.6 billion, up from $4.5 billion. Costs at Barclays Capital rose to $13.3 billion from $10.6 billion as it hired staff members and invested in technology. Richard Hunter, head of British equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers in London, said the earnings were ârepresentative of something of a return to normality.â Mr. Diamond came under some criticism last month after telling a parliamentary committee in London that it was time to stop blaming banks for the financial crisis. In an attempt to justify his remarks, Mr. Diamond said on Tuesday that âwe as banks need to do more to help foster economic growth and job creation as well as helping the public understand better the significant role we already play in this regard.â Barclays said the year was off to a good start and that it expected loan write-offs to drop again in 2011, but not as much as in 2010.
