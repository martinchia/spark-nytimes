From Reuters Breakingviews: If Canada thinks a hole in the ground is a national gem, TMX, which operates the Toronto and Montreal stock exchanges, probably qualifies as a diamond. As a result, TMX is likely to sit out further sector consolidation. That’s a shame, as doing a deal with a foreign buyer might help both the exchange and Canada. Canadaâs rejection last week of BHP Billitonâs bid for the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan has injected uncertainty into foreign bids for any sizable companies, particularly resource groups. The decision has a strong whiff of protectionism. That is a problem for potential bidders for TMX. Any buyer wishing to acquire more than a 10 percent stake must receive approval from Ontario and Quebec securities regulators, and a foreign buyer seeking control would need a nod from the federal government of Canada.
