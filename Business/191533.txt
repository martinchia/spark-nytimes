 The stock market moved modestly higher on Wednesday, recovering more than half of what it lost the day before, as investors looked beyond two disappointing economic reports. Shares in CBS and other broadcasters rose after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of them over Aereo, a start-up Internet company, in a closely watched copyright case. “The trend for this market is still, for the time being, up,” said Anastasia V. Amoroso, a global market strategist with J.P. Morgan Funds. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 9.55 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,959.53. The index fell 12.63 points the day before.
