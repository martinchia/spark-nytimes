7:02 p.m. | Updated  Only days after the Justice Department sued to block AT&Tâs $39 billion acquisition of T-Mobile USA, Sprint Nextel is following suit. The company said on Tuesday that it filed its own lawsuit in the United States District Court in Washington, echoing the Justice Departmentâs argument that allowing the deal to go through would significantly restrict the American cellphone service landscape. âAT&Tâs proposed takeover of T-Mobile is brazenly anticompetitive,â Sprint wrote in its complaint, adding that it would push the market âback toward a 1980s-style cellphone duopoly that would force consumers to endure higher prices and be denied the fruits of vigorous innovation.â It is the first of a potential string of lawsuits aimed at stopping the blockbuster telecommunications merger, though it would most likely be subordinate to the Obama administrationâs case. AT&T has said that it plans to fight the Justice Department, though it also plans to continue talks with the government in hopes of securing a settlement. And T-Mobileâs current owner, Deutsche Telekom, has also said it would take steps to ensure the merger goes through. Sprintâs lawyers in the litigation are from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. They will be going up against Arnold & Porter for AT&T and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton for T-Mobile. Sprint was one of the first and biggest opponents of the T-Mobile deal, having failed to buy the wireless carrier itself earlier this year. Its main argument is that putting the two companies together would cement AT&T and Verizon Wireless as the giants of cellphone service, leaving others even further behind and less equipped to compete. Sprintâs chief executive, Daniel Hesse, has been exceptionally vocal in listing reasons to oppose the deal. Should the merger go through, he said in a speech this year, âcompetition will be stifled, growth will be stifled, and wireless innovation will be jeopardized.â The company has also sought to combat many of AT&Tâs claims about the merger, including its job impact. After AT&T announced that it would repatriate 5,000 call-center jobs and preserve some 25,000 existing positions if the deal goes through, Sprint commissioned its own study to rebut those assertions. Even without the deal, however, Sprint is facing its own challenges, including revamping its 4G wireless network. (A bit of trivia: Sprint’s lawsuit has been assigned to Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle, the same judge overseeing the Justice Department’s action.)
