Jamie Dimon is frustrated. In a surprisingly public demonstration of his aggravation, Mr. Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, unloaded last week on Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, critically questioning the governmentâs efforts to regulate the banking industry. âI have this great fear that someoneâs going to write a book in 10 or 20 years, and the book is going to talk about all the things that we did in the middle of a crisis that actually slowed down recovery,â he told Mr. Bernanke at a televised meeting of bankers in Atlanta, ticking off a laundry list of new regulations like higher capital requirements and a tax on systemically important financial institutions. âDo you have a fear like I do that when we will look back and look at them all, that they will be the reason it took so longâ for our banks, our credit and our businesses and “most importantly job creation” to get going again?, he asked Mr. Bernanke. âIs this holding us back?â His question, which was quickly cheered by traders on Wall Street, was dismissed by some in Washington and on Main Street as self-serving propaganda from a chief executive seeking less regulation and higher profits. âI see a lot of amnesia setting in now,â Sheila Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, told me during a conversation at the Council on Foreign Relations two days after Mr. Dimonâs comments. âOn obvious things like higher capital standards, I say full speed ahead and the higher the better.â Making a veiled dig at Mr. Dimon, she added, âbanks are not doing a lot of lending now, and the ones that are doing the better job of lending are the smaller institutions that have the higher capital levels.â Nearly three years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the prevailing wisdom is that we need tighter regulations to avoid another crisis. Itâs a popular view, one that this column has long supported. After all, if we donât adopt tougher standards now, then when? I called Mr. Dimon, in part, to challenge his view. But I was somewhat taken aback by his response, which was far more nuanced than his seeming diatribe to the Fed chairman. âMy point wasnât that we shouldnât regulate the industry,â he said. âBut we should think twice about how exactly weâre doing it and the cumulative impact of the changes if the main goal is to help create jobs.â The more restrictions put on banks, he said, the less lending and financing of businesses that will take place. To him, itâs simple arithmetic. âI want job growth like everybody else,â he said. The problem, he contends is âweâre trying to do two very different things at the same time,â referring to regulating the industry and stimulating the economy. âI would stop trying to solve every perceived problem at once,â he added. âThe highest and most important thing we can do right now is to get the economy growing and adding jobs.â Itâs easy to dismiss Mr. Dimon as another banker crying wolf. His firm has vigorously lobbied to prevent the Federal Reserve from raising capital ratios to 10 percent from 7 percent, fearful it will crimp lending â and probably profits (and yes, compensation.) But itâs also an uncomfortable truth that Mr. Dimon should be taken seriously, at least his suggestion that policy makers canât predict the full impact of the coming regulation. âJamie Dimon is right that it only makes sense to look at the effects of financial regulation holistically,â said Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard University, and the co-author of âThis Time is Different,â which looked at financial crises over several centuries. When Mr. Bernanke answered Mr. Dimonâs question, he said, âHas anybody done a comprehensive analysis of the impact on credit? I canât pretend that anybody really has. You know, itâs just too complicated. We donât really have the quantitative tools to do that.â That was an unsatisfying answer and an uncomfortable truth, too. Indeed, Mr. Dimon may be right: Strict regulation could hamper the recovery in the short term. But his comments also raise a larger policy and political question: Can we afford to risk another collapse of the financial system â even if it doesnât happen for another 100 years â by going lighter on regulation today? Itâs an idea, by the way, that is very hard for regular Joes to swallow. Mr. Rogoff, whom Mr. Dimon has often cited, isnât so sure it is that black and white. âMy instinct is that the Fed must be right to push for raising capital requirements from 7 to 10 percent,â Mr. Rogoff said. âSwitzerland has already committed to the higher capital route and rather than hurting their banks, it might even have given them a competitive advantage, especially given the dodgy state of many European bank balance sheets.â Other academic studies have come to similar conclusions. Anat R. Admati of Stanford University wrote a compelling report, âFallacies, Irrelevant Facts and Myths in the Discussion of Capital Regulation: Why Bank Equity is Not Expensiveâ that suggests that raising capital requirements is not as dangerous or costly as some on Wall Street believe. Still, Mr. Rogoff acknowledged, âI donât see a big need to rush to raise capital requirements. If history tells us anything, it is that having a deep financial crisis is the best vaccine against having another one, at least for awhile.â In a perfect, less politicized world, perhaps we could follow Mr. Dimonâs advice and wait to increase regulation until the economy is on steadier footing. (Itâs worth noting that most of the Fedâs proposed rules and requirements already would be phased in over time.) But will bankers â or even regulators and lawmakers  â think the industry needs new rules when the economy and the job market are in full-on growth mode? After all, the financial system only gets tested in times of crisis â at which point regulation comes too late. Advertisement
