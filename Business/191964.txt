The Fortress Investment Group said on Tuesday that Daniel H. Mudd had resigned as the investment firm’s chief executive, as he remained the subject of a government lawsuit tied to his tenure as the head of Fannie Mae. Fortress also said that Mr. Mudd had resigned as a director.  Randal A. Nardone, a Fortress co-founder who had been filling in as chief executive since Mr. Mudd took a leave of absence last month, will continue to serve in that role. âI want to thank Fortress for the opportunity to help lead the company over the last few years,â Mr. Mudd said in a statement. âHowever, I do not want the uncertainty associated with a leave of absence, on my part, to become a distraction for either Fortress or its investors, and thus, I have decided to resign.â Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Mr. Mudd and five other former executives of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance giants. Mr. Mudd served as Fannie Mae’s chief executive from 2005 to 2008, during which the company began buying more risky home loans to generate higher profits. At the heart of the S.E.C.’s lawsuit are claims that Mr. Mudd misled investors about Fannie’s exposure to those mortgages, which imploded and eventually led to a government bailout and his ouster.  The former Fannie and Freddie executives, including Mr. Mudd, have said the companies disclosed the mortgage holdings in regulatory filings and planned to challenge the S.E.C.’s lawsuit. James Wareham, a lawyer for Mr. Mudd, declined to comment beyond the Fortress press release. Mr. Mudd joined Fortress, an investment firm with private equity and hedge fund arms, in August 2009.  Since then, the firm’s stock price has fallen 31 percent in volatile markets, closing on Tuesday at $3.65 a share. Fortress said in November that its third-quarter earnings fell 45 percent, as its hedge fund portfolios posted steep losses.  âWe regret losing Dan,” the firm’s three principals, Mr. Nardone, Peter Briger and Wesley Edens, said in the Fortress statement. “We want to thank him for his leadership and for his many contributions to Fortress.” Advertisement
