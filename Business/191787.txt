Yesterday, The Times ran a front-page story, written by A. G. Sulzberger, about the growing number of hospitals (and other companies) that are refusing to hire smokers. The piece reports that, according to federal estimates, employees who smoke cost, on average, $3,391 more a year than nonsmokers for health care and lost productivity. âWe felt it was unfair for employees who maintained healthy lifestyles to have to subsidize those who do not,â said Steven C. Bjelich, chief executive of St. Francis Medical Center in Cape Girardeau, Mo., which stopped hiring smokers last month. Dr. Michael Siegel, a professor at the Boston University School of Public Health who has written about the trend, offered a different view: âIf enough of these companies adopt theses policies and it really becomes difficult for smokers to find jobs, there are going to be consequences. Unemployment is also bad for health.â Have you considered not hiring smokers? You're the Boss offers an insider's perspective on small-business ownership.
