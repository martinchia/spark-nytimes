8:45 a.m. | Updated  HONG KONG â Baidu, Chinaâs biggest Internet search engine company, said on Tuesday that it had reached a preliminary $1.9 billion deal to acquire 91 Wireless, a major developer of app stores in China. The proposed acquisition would be the biggest yet for Baidu as it seeks to branch out beyond its traditional search business in order to better compete against the rival Chinese Internet giants Alibaba and Tencent, and it is the latest in a series of acquisitions in the sector. In May, Baidu agreed to pay $370 million for the online video business of PPStream. One week earlier, Alibaba had said it would pay $586 million for an 18 percent stake in Weibo, a hugely popular Twitter-like microblogging service in China owned by the Sina Corporation. Baidu, which is listed on the Nasdaq, said on Tuesday that it had signed a legally binding memorandum of understanding to acquire majority control of 91 Wireless from NetDragon Websoft, a company listed in Hong Kong that invests in online games and mobile Internet businesses in China. The preliminary deal calls for Baidu to pay NetDragon $1.09 billion for its 57.4 percent stake in 91 Wireless, and to offer around $800 million on similar terms to the owners of the remaining 42.6 percent stake, who were not identified. The companies have until Aug. 14 to agree on final terms for the transaction. Analysts said the deal was likely to give Baidu a boost in the fast-changing and ultracompetitive mainland China marketplace.  Will Tao, an analyst at iResearch, said the acquisition was a “very necessary move” for Baidu, in order to beef up its mobile Internet presence. “As one of the leading app stores, 91 could help Baiduâs mobile Internet strategy and expand Baiduâs mobile user base,” he said. Last month, NetDragon said revenue in its mobile Internet business in the first quarter of the year rose to 144.7 million renminbi ($23.5 million), more than tripling from the period a year earlier. A crucial part of that business is 91 Wireless, which was set up in 2007 and today operates the popular 91 Assistant and HiMarket app stores in China, which run on Googleâs Android operating system. As of March, the two stores had reached more than 10 billion cumulative app downloads, according to NetDragonâs latest earnings release. The 91 Wireless unit also develops its own apps, like PandaReader, which allows users to read and bookmark documents created in a number of file formats. “This will be the largest transaction in Baidu’s history and should help the company to secure a strong position in mobile Internet with a leading mobile app store in China,” Chi Tsang, a telecommunications and Internet analyst at HSBC, wrote in a research note on Tuesday. “The significant traffic will likely reinforce Baidu’s position as a leading starting page on mobile, in addition to its leading search and map apps.” NetDragon said in a stock exchange filing on Tuesday that a separate plan announced in December to seek a potential spinoff of the 91 Wireless business on Hong Kongâs secondary board would be scrapped, pending finalization of the sale to Baidu. Shares in NetDragon closed down 21 percent on Tuesday on news of the proposed sale and abandonment of the spinoff plans. Still, the stock has risen about 72 percent this year in anticipation that the company will cash out of 91 Wireless. Eric Pfanner contributed reporting.
