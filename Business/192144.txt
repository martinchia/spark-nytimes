Brian Moynihan isnât one to look back. And as the chief executive of Bank of America, he has plenty of reasons not to, Nelson D. Schwartz reports in The New York Times. His company is staggering under the weight of his predecessorsâ decisions, and each day seems to bring more bad news. More than 1.3 million of the bankâs customers are behind on their home loans, all 50 state attorneys general are investigating the industryâs foreclosure practices and Bank of America has become a leading symbol of the mortgage mess. When the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, bragged late last month that his group was about to âtake downâ an American bank with a mother lode of damaging insider documents, the scuttlebutt on Wall Street quickly turned to Bank of America, sending its shares down more than 3 percent in a day. But donât bother feeling sorry for Mr. Moynihan. As far as heâs concerned, things are just fine. âItâs been a great year and weâve learned a lot,â he said during an interview in his office here, 58 floors above downtown Charlotte. âThereâs not a better job in the world.â Advertisement
