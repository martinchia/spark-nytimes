The Times recently published an article noting a significant decline in the incomes of the top 1 percent. Their share of national income â a common benchmark of inequality â fell to 17 percent in 2009, from 23 percent in 2007, according to federal tax data. Within the group, average income fell by about a third, to $959,000 in 2009 from $1.4 million in 2007. Analysts say the drop largely reflects the stock market plunge and most say they think incomes recovered somewhat in 2010 as the market rebounded. For readers who want to do their own analysis, Emmanuel Saez, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and a French colleague, Thomas Piketty, have compiled annual data on top incomes from 1913 to 2008. They maintain a database that is easily searched.  Steven Kaplan of the University of Chicago updated their time series for 2009. The spreadsheet, via Mr. Kaplan, is below, and downloadable here as a pdf.
