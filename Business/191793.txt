Goldman Sachsâs $450 million investment in Facebook has raised many questions. Here is a guide to understanding the legal issues raised by the deal.  499 Holders  Goldman Sachs is offering $1.5 billion worth of Facebook shares to its private clients.  The clients will not hold the shares directly but will invest in a special investment vehicle that will hold the shares on their behalf.   Questions have arisen about whether this share issuance will push Facebook over 499 shareholders.  Under federal securities laws — Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 — a company is required to begin reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission, filing quarterly and annual reports among other items, once it has more than 499 shareholders of record.  This does not mean it needs to do an initial public offering, just commence these filings.  The requirement to begin reporting is effective 120 days after the end of the fiscal year a company exceeded this amount.  So, if Facebook goes over the amount this year, they are required to start reporting to the S.E.C. in early May of 2012.  There was some speculation that Facebook was going to take the position that since the shares are held through a single vehicle, they count as only one shareholder and so the threshold is not exceeded.  As I wrote on Monday when I discussed this more fully, it is unlikely that the S.E.C. would buy into this claim.  It now appears that Facebook and Goldman agree, as it is being reported that Facebook has indicated that it will begin reporting to the S.E.C. by April 2012. So, why a single investment vehicle?  Probably to make the offering easier for Facebook.  It only has to deal with one shareholder â Goldman â instead of hundreds of needy Goldman clients.  In addition, a single vehicle ensures that none of these Goldman clients sell their shares early or before Facebook wants them to, and allows Goldman to better coordinate this investment and these controls.  The investment vehicle structure has the additional benefit of making it easier for Goldman to take its 5 percent cut of any profit. Goldman can simply withhold this amount after the shares are sold or distributed to its clients.   Offering Violation  The securities law issue here rests on whether there is a âgeneral solicitationâ such that this becomes a âpublic offering.â  The federal securities laws strictly regulate any offering of shares.  A company or underwriter like Goldman must find an exemption or otherwise register the securities with the S.E.C.  The Facebook shares are not being registered, so Facebook and Goldman are relying on an exemption.   In this case, the exemptions are for the share issuance to the Goldman vehicle and for the issuance of securities in the Goldman vehicle to the investors.  In the latter case, it is likely that Goldmanâs clients are simply purchasing shares, or other interests, in the vehicle holding the Facebook shares.  This second issuance also needs an exemption since again all issuances of securities need to be registered or have an exemption.   For those who are securities wonks, Facebook and Goldman are likely playing it safe and relying in both instances on the Regulation D private placement exemption to avoid registration. To meet the Regulation D or other exemptions from registration that Goldman might alternatively rely on, the party offering (i.e., Facebook or the Goldman vehicle) must not make a general solicitation of investors such that there would be a public offering of securities.       In any case, the core of the exemption for the Goldman vehicleâs issuance to Goldmanâs clients is sophistication.  So long as Goldmanâs issuance is to so-called sophisticated investors, then the offering can go to as many Goldman clients as meet that qualification.  If indeed, the issuance is under Regulation D, then the threshold for sophisticated here is low, only $1 million in assets, or $200,000 in income the past two years ($300,000 if married).  The S.E.C. has suggested raising this threshold in recent years, asserting that this is too easy to meet for a test of sophistication, but it has yet to do so.   Goldmanâs clients will easily meet this test, as the minimum investment is reportedly $2 million.  The problem is the general solicitation bar.  Regulation D and other exemptions that Goldman might rely on are centered on the lack of a public offering.  Since the investment is offered only to sophisticated investors defined by wealth and not to common investors, then there is not a widespread offering.   The rules can be rather subjective as to what constitutes a general solicitation, but Goldman and its legal counsel are quite experienced in these procedures.  No doubt, Goldman is being careful, and it appears to be circulating the investment opportunity to prequalified investors who meet the sophistication test.  Goldman is not soliciting outside a confined group.  Because of this, even with the media hoopla, the S.E.C. is unlikely to find grounds to protest unless a big mistake is made.  Goldman  Goldman is offering Facebook shares to its clients.  Goldman here is an investment adviser to these clients, so it does have a fiduciary responsibility to know its customers and recommend appropriate investments.  Individual investors, however, may have different tastes for risk and different returns than Goldmanâs private equity arm.  The Goldman clients may be willing to accept a lower return for other reasons like the security of knowing that the valuation is unlikely to go down, as part of a portfolio that allows for more speculation, etc.  No doubt Goldman has disclosed the risks associated with Facebook copiously, and if investors, being fully informed of the material facts here, still want to invest, Goldman is doing its job.   Second, there is the Volcker Rule, which was devised to stem large banks from âproprietary trading,â keeping them instead focused on trading and capital markets. The regulations that will define the Volcker rule are still being devised and the rule itself will not take effect until July 2012.  Goldman is likely to have sold its position by then.  Even so, the investment would be allowed under the rule.  The Volcker Rule allows for these types of investments up to 3 percent of Tier 1 capital of Goldman.  For Goldman, as of September 2010, that would have been a maximum of about $2.1 billion —  well above its Facebook investment.   This assumes that the Facebook investment wasnât structured to work around application of the rule.  This is a real possibility particularly since the details of the rule have yet to be spelled out in regulations.   If Congress had adopted a stricter version of the Volker rule it might have barred this investment.  But Congress chose not to amid a vigorous protest by the banks.    Advertisement
