In the nearly eight years that he has led the Nasdaq OMX Group, Robert Greifeld has made his name as a deal maker, cleaning house at the market operator and expanding its size. That reputation faces its biggest challenge yet as analysts and investors await his response to the rapid-fire consolidation of exchanges, one that analysts say could leave his company weakened and alone. Nasdaq is exploring a potential bid for its longtime rival, NYSE Euronext, which is moving forward on a merger with Deutsche BÃ¶rse, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. Mr. Greifeldâs company has provisionally lined up $5 billion in debt financing to help pay for an audacious offer to steal NYSE Euronext from Deutsche BÃ¶rse and break it up. It has also been in talks with the InterContinental Exchange over how to split up NYSE Euronext if his takeover bid succeeds. Such boldness is typical of Mr. Greifeld, 53, a pugnacious cheerleader for Nasdaq who has rarely shied away from confrontation. Last year, he mused on CNBC that a slowdown of trades by NYSE Euronext during the so-called flash crash could have hurt markets. (His counterpart at the Big Board, Duncan L. Niederauer, issued a retort on air about a half-hour later.) “He’s a take-no-prisoners type,” Richard Repetto, an analyst with Sandler OâNeill & Partners, said in an interview by phone. “He’s willing to go for it.” But Nasdaqâs potential bid for NYSE Euronext faces a number of difficult hurdles. For the moment, Mr. Greifeld has not reached an agreement with ICE over the terms of breaking up the Big Board operator. Mr. Greifeld could still decide not to make a run at NYSE Euronext, said the people who had been briefed on the matter. Nasdaq has also weighed its options for a potential alliance with the London Stock Exchange, which is already working on a merger with the Toronto Stock Exchange. Nonetheless, Mr. Greifeld has felt that Nasdaq needs to take some action to keep pace with newly enlarged international rivals, who can offer more scale and services. By combining with parts of NYSE Euronext — mainly the cash equities trading business — Nasdaq could create a highly profitable exchange giant with a fearsome market share in stock trading. Nasdaq declined to comment or make Mr. Greifeld available for this article. Many questions still hang over a potential bid, however, including skepticism from antitrust regulators and market customers. Then there is the issue of whether two rivals whose competition runs deep could ever team up, especially when it is unclear whether a merger would yield much room for NYSE Euronextâs current management in the executive suite. Taking on NYSE Euronext could also strain Nasdaqâs finances, at least in the short term. Nasdaq carries nearly $2.2 billion in long-term debt, the product of several share repurchases. “He’d be pushing the envelope in terms of debt,” Mr. Repetto said. Mr. Greifeld, a born and bred New Yorker, joined Nasdaq in 2003 from Sungard Data Systems, capping a career in trading technology. When he joined Nasdaq, it faced enormous trials, including overexpansion in unprofitable areas and an ignominious debut on the pink sheets. Under Mr. Greifeld, the company has rebuilt itself into a much leaner, more profitable operation with enviable operating margins of about 46 percent, said Edward Ditmire, an analyst with Macquarie Securities. NYSE Euronext, by contrast, has about a 35 percent margin despite having what Mr. Ditmire called a richer mix of businesses. “Thatâs the strongest compliment I can pay him,” Mr. Ditmire said. Mr. Greifeldâs demanding management style has also led to what analysts said was some friction with Nasdaqâs management team, some of whom have left in recent years.  In 2009, the companyâs executive vice president, Magnus BÃ¶cker, left to head the Singapore Exchange. And last month, its chief financial officer, Adena Friedman, stepped down to join the Carlyle Group. During Mr. Greifeldâs tenure, he has focused in part on building the company through a series of deals, acquiring the likes of the Boston and Philadelphia stock exchanges. Perhaps his biggest triumph came in 2007 when he won OMX, a group of European exchanges, fending off a rival bid by Borse Dubai. Those deals have given Nasdaq greater size and, with OMX, international reach. Mr. Greifeld has also burnished his reputation by successfully integrating those purchases into Nasdaq. Last year, Nasdaq reported $395 million in annual profit, a 48 percent increase from 2009, though revenue slid during the same period. Its stock price has risen nearly 21 percent in the last 12 months, closing on Wednesday at $25.33. Yet for all his deal-making efforts, Mr. Greifeld still has a black mark on his record: his year-and-a-half-long failed effort to take over the London Stock Exchange that began in 2006. Nasdaq went hostile, hoping to use its big stake in its British rival as leverage even as it sought to talk up the benefits of the trans-Atlantic alliance. But the London exchangeâs hard-nosed chief, Clara Furse, repeatedly argued that Nasdaqâs bid was undervalued, and subsequently struck a deal to merge with another market operator, Borsa Italiana. In the fall of 2007, Nasdaq sold off its stake in the London Stock Exchange. At least some good came out of it: Mr. Greifeld sold the holdings at a profit. Advertisement
