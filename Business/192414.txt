 Larry Ellison is ceding the driverâs seat at Oracle while keeping one hand on wheel. The founder of the software giant is stepping down as chief executive officer, but his 25 percent stake in the company — and dual role as chairman and chief technology officer — ensure heâs far from relinquishing control. Splitting his former job between two executives could, however, lead to a bumpy transition. Oracle and Mr. Ellison are difficult to untangle. The larger-than-life founder has imbued his creation with his own combative personality. Rivals are disparaged, or simply bought: The company spent more than $40 billion on acquisitions over the past decade. Sometimes the ties between the two have seemed too close. Shareholders rejected Mr. Ellisonâs outsize pay package two years in a row in nonbinding votes. And companies he controls have leased airplanes and sold software and advertising to Oracle. Investors canât really complain, though, since Oracleâs stock has quadrupled over the past decade. Unfortunately, companies often struggle when their iconic founders step down. Apple, for example, nearly went bust after Steve Jobs was kicked out â though it soared again upon his return. Dell and Starbucks went through similarly harrowing experiences. Such turbulence at Oracle is unlikely. Mr. Ellison will retain control of the companyâs guts: engineering and technology. He will also be executive chairman, And since he still owns a quarter of the company, the board will not be a democracy in any meaningful sense. Two current executives, Mark Hurd and Safra Catz, will provide at least temporary stability by sharing the chief executive role. Mr. Hurd will continue to run sales and marketing, while Ms. Catz will remain in control of finance, legal and manufacturing. Mr. Ellison is 70 years old, however, and a succession plan may exist. If not, thereâs a risk that the co-chief executive arrangement will end up in a costly power struggle. Thatâs one potential pothole heâll want to maneuver around before handing over the keys. By QUENTIN HARDY The top job at the database giant will be shared by Mark V. Hurd, now co-president, and Safra Catz, who is co-president and chief financial officer.
