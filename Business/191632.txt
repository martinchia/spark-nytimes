ThyssenKrupp, the giant German steel maker, agreed on Tuesday to sell its Inoxum unit to a Finnish rival, creating one of the world’s largest stainless steel makers.  The sale of Inoxum to Outokumpu of Finland was widely expected after prolonged negotiations with ThyssenKrupp’s employees, who feared the deal would result in job cuts. Ultimately, ThyssenKrupp reached a compromise with its employees on Tuesday that would eliminate 850 positions in Germany. But ThyssenKrupp has agreed to offer alternative jobs for up to 600 workers, leaving the combined company with roughly 19,000 employees worldwide. ThyssenKrupp said it would not force out any employees at German manufacturing sites until 2015. One melt shop will remain open until 2016, the company said.   “The agreement reached with the German labor representatives overnight marks a significant milestone in the negotiations,” Outokumpu said in a statement.  The transaction values Inoxum at 2.7 billion euros ($3.5 billion).  Under the terms of the deal, Outokumpu will pay 1 billion euros, while also lending 235 million euros to ThyssenKrupp and taking on 422 million euros of Inoxum’s debt. To finance the deal, Outokumpu is planning a 1 billion euro rights offering with some of its top shareholders.  The deal, which combines two of the world’s largest stainless steel producers, will also offer ThyssenKrupp a nearly 30 percent stake in the newly formed company, according to company statements.  The deal for Inoxum coincides with ThyssenKrupp’s larger effort to sell assets and reduce debt as the steel industry contends with competition from China and elsewhere. The company’s chief executive, Heinrich Hiesinger, has pushed consolidation in the industry to keep pace with lower-cost rivals and its struggles to sell as much as it was producing.  In May, ThyssenKrupp announced a strategy to revamp the business, a plan that included major divestitures of crucial assets.  Inoxum always figured to play a central role in the makeover, though not necessarily through a sale. ThyssenKrupp previously outlined options including an initial public offering or a spinoff of the company into a separate entity.  When ThyssenKrupp reported its 2010-2011 financial statements, Inoxum was already designated as a “discontinued operation.”  ThyssenKrupp’s board has “generally approved” the deal with Outokumpu, the German company said in its statement. But before the deal closes, it must receive full approval from regulators and the boards of both companies. The ThyssenKrupp supervisory board is to meet later on Tuesday. Advertisement
