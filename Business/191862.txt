It is no secret that James P. Gorman is one of Morgan Stanley’s biggest supporters.  Now the Morgan Stanley chief executive is putting his money where his mouth is, buying 100,000 shares on Thursday, a purchase valued at roughly $2 million. Mr. Gorman is one of the largest individual shareholders of Morgan Stanley stock. Among firm insiders he is third largest, behind John J. Mack, the firm’s chairman,  and Paul J. Taubman, a senior banker and co-president of institutional securities. The latest purchase will increase Mr. Gorman’s holdings to about a million shares, valued at roughly $20 million. It is not unusual for senior executives at corporations to own large amounts of company stock, but most of it is accumulated as part of their pay.  This is the first time Mr. Gorman has bought an individual block of stock. Morgan Stanley stock has been trading around $21 a share lately, near its 52-week low.  This has been a sore spot for Mr. Gorman, who thinks the stock is worth much more, according to people familiar with his thinking but not authorized to speak on the record.  At the bank’s annual meeting in May, Mr. Gorman expressed his frustration with the low stock price and said it was only a matter of time before a large value investor made a big move on financial services stocks.   “Somebody will make a move, a major shareholder will get in,” he said.
