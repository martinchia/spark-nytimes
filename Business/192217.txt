HSBC said on Sunday that the bank was under pressure to move its headquarters from London, but noted that reports of “imminent change” were “speculative and presumptuous.” Douglas Flint, the chairman, and Stuart Gulliver, the chief executive, said in a joint statement that they were “being increasingly asked by shareholders and investors about the likely additional cost of being headquartered in the U.K.” As grounds for the pressure from investors, they cited “possible regulatory changes and additional costs such as the bank levy.â The executives were responding to a report in The Sunday Telegraph in which unidentified HSBC investors were quoted as saying that the bankâs relocation to Hong Kong was likely. Last week, the bank reported full-year profit of $13.2 billion for 2010, doubling its gains from the previous year but missing analysts’ expectations. The bank also lowered its outlook for return on shareholder equity, citing new rules requiring it to hold more capital in reserve. “We are very clear that the City of London’s competitive position deserves protection and HSBC will play a full part in this,” the two executives said. “We are encouraged by the U.K. government’s recent commitments to do the same.” The carefully worded statement is the latest development in a tug of war between banks with major operations in Britain and the countryâs Conservative government over how tightly financial institutions should be regulated. Last month, the government said it had reached an agreement with the country’s largest banks — the Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Barclays, the Lloyds Banking Group and the British unit of the Spanish bank Santander — on lending and banker salaries. The pact, known as Project Merlin, includes commitments on the banksâ part to lend Â£190 billion this year, and to disclose the salaries of their five highest-paid executives. It did not, however, include a cap on pay. More worrisome for HSBC, though, are new rules on capital reserves that require banks to keep a larger proportion of their balance sheets liquid to buffer against future calamity. Such requirements prevent banks from investing that capital in assets that might generate higher returns but also protect them from the possibility that riskier assets may decline in value, as they did during the subprime crisis. Days before Project Merlin was concluded, Britain’s chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, said the country would impose an annual levy of Â£2.5 billion on banks. There are many in Britain who believe that even those measures do not go nearly far enough. The Telegraph published an interview on Friday with Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, in which he warned that “the institutions bailed out were those at the heart of the crisis,” and insisted that “the problem is still there. The ‘search for yield’ goes on. Imbalances are beginning to grow again.” That followed a speech last month by Adair Turner, chairman of the British securities regulator, the Financial Services Authority, titled “Reforming finance: are we being radical enough?” in which he called many precrisis assumptions “fatally flawed.” “Financial markets and systems which are as free and competitive as we can  feasibly make them will sometimes deliver neither stability nor allocative efficiency,” he said, calling for higher capital requirements, adjusted incentive structures and “macro-prudential policies” that would give regulators new powers in the event of crisis.   Bruce Packard, an analyst at the British brokerage house Seymour Pierce, wrote in a note to clients on Monday that “a lot is going on behind the scenes here. It looks as if the regulators are doing their lobbying in public, yet we think it is highly likely that the banks are probably lobbying ‘over the heads’ of the regulators directly to the politicians.” Mr. Packard noted that special interest lobbying often backfired.  He cited Atlantic fishermen pushing back against regulation as cod populations collapsed, accountants resisting the separation of consulting and auditing before the implosion of Arthur Andersen, and airlines fighting new safety measures before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. “Though the structural remedies that the I.C.B.Â  might recommend would raise costs and reduce profitability,” he wrote, referring to the countryâs Independent Commission on Banking, “theyÂ could also change the structure of the industry to the benefit of the owners of equity capital rather than the bonus-collecting managers.” Advertisement
