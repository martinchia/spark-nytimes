Rearden Commerce, an e-commerce platform company, announced on Wednesday that it had raised $133 million, valuing the company at $1.35 billion. The latest financing round was led by current investors, JPMorgan Chase and American Express, and new investor, Citigroup. Rearden, which has raised a total $353 million since it was founded in 1999, also announced on Wednesday that it had acquired HomeRun, a daily deals service. Rearden said it planned to use the money for acquisitions and other âhigh-growth initiatives.â âThis is a group of some of the worldâs leaders in commerce for consumers and merchants alike, and we believe that the combination of their assets and the Deem platform are indeed transformational,â Patrick Grady, the chief executive of Rearden, said in a statement, referring to the companyâs flagship e-commerce platform.  Built in the twilight years of the dot-com boom, Reardenâs Web-based applications help businesses and consumers execute and manage online transactions, like business travel reservations and consumer loyalty programs. Based in Foster City, Calif., the company has 7,300 business clients and about 40 strategic partners. With the purchase of HomeRun, a site that offers users localized discounts, Rearden will get access to the highly competitive and rapidly consolidating daily deal market — currently dominated by the social shopping site Groupon. The company did not disclose the purchase price of HomeRun, but said it planned to integrate the service within its e-commerce platform in order to leverage its network of customers. HomeRun had three million subscribers as of February of this year. âAdding the expertise in social commerce and game mechanics from the HomeRun.com team, along with their pioneering work in self-service merchant tools, aims to instantly enhance the value of the Deem platform,” Mr. Grady said. Reardenâs financing round comes as volatility in the equity markets threatens the public offering plans of several large Web companies, like Groupon and Zynga, the gaming company. Despite the uncertainty, several technology start-ups, like Rearden, have pursued major financing rounds at multibillion-dollar valuations. The data storage company DropBox, for instance, is said to be raising a financing round at a $4 billion valuation from investors like Index Ventures and Goldman Sachs, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.
