LONDON â The Italian drug maker Rottapharm said on Thursday that it had decided not to proceed with its initial public offering, citing in part âunfavorable Italian and international market conditions.â A little more than a week ago, Rottapharm, which operates under the name Rottapharm|Madaus, said it hoped to price its offering of 50 million shares at 7.25 euros to 9 euros a share.  The bottom end of the price range would have valued the company at about â¬1.45 billion, or about $2 billion. The company first announced plans for an I.P.O. in April. âThe conditions have not been met for the execution of a transaction that reflect the current intrinsic value of the company,â Rottapharm said in a statement on Thursday. Unfavorable market conditions led to âa rapid change in the expectations of investors on European assets and, in particular, on Southern European assets,â the company said. The offering, which would have represented about a quarter of Rottapharmâs share capital, would have come from shares held by an investment vehicle controlled by the Rovati family, Rottapharmâs owners. Rottapharm, founded in 1961, is the maker of Dona, which is used to manage pain associated with osteoarthritis; Legalon, a treatment for liver disorders; and Reparil, an anti-inflammatory drug and pain reducer. The company employs more than 2,000 employees in 85 countries. Advertisement
