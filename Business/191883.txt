The bidding war for Southern Union has turned into a battle of lawyers.  After the natural gas pipeline operator agreed to talk with the Williams Companies about a takeover, lawyers for the rival bidder Energy Transfer Equity responded with a sharply worded letter.   Energy Transfer, through its lawyers at Latham & Watkins, reiterated the company’s stance that Southern Union “is not permitted” to “engage in any discussions or negotiations with Williams” or “furnish Williams any nonpublic information,” according to a regulatory filing. Doing so, the firm wrote, would “constitute a willful and intentional breach of the merger agreement.” The next day the legal counsel for Southern Union, Locke Lord Bissell & Liddell, fired off  a succinct note, acknowledging that it had received the letter and stating its contrary opinion. “We respectfully disagree with your position,” the letter said. “The company has exercised great care, and will continue to exercise great care, to comply fully with the terms of the merger agreement.” Energy Transfer and Williams have been playing tug of war over Southern Union. A couple of weeks ago, Energy Transfer offered $4.2 billion for Southern Union in a complicated all-stock deal worth $33 a share. Williams emerged a few days later, bidding $4.9 billion in cash, or roughly $39 a share. Investors are betting the bidding war has just begun. On Tuesday, shares of Southern Union closed at $40.15, roughly 3 percent higher than the offer from Williams. Advertisement
