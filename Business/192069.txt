Raj Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group’s founder, is scheduled to begin trial on Feb. 28 on charges that he engaged in insider trading, and prosecutors and defense lawyers are aggressively sparring over a range of preliminary issues in an effort to frame their cases for the jury.  While it is still possible the two sides will agree to a plea bargain, the intensity of the fight certainly makes it look like they are gearing up for one of the biggest insider trading trials ever. Both Mr. Rajaratnam and prosecutors are trying to put the finishing touches on their cases by seeking batches of documents to fill in potential holes in the evidence, and each has filed briefs with Judge Richard J. Holwell in Federal District Court in Manhattan arguing what the jury should or should not be allowed to hear.   Trials are more theater than dispassionate search for the truth, so each side wants to present its evidence and arguments in the most favorable light.  Unlike “Spider-Man” on Broadway, the lawyers cannot test out theories and evidence in previews, and the filings give some insight into the strategies each side will pursue at trial.    Here is a brief overview of the issues they are arguing about in the final stages before trial. The Galleon Group has been under investigation for years, first by the Securities and Exchange Commission and then the Justice Department.   Since Mr. Rajaratnamâs arrest in October 2009, the firm produced more than 1.5 million pages of records in response to four different grand jury subpoenas, on top of a trove of documents turned over to the S.E.C.  Prosecutors filed a motion on Jan. 13 for a trial subpoena to be issued to Galleon for even more records related to trading in 16 securities, some dating back to transactions in 2005, plus e-mail related to certain companies and information about Mr. Rajaratnamâs compensation.   Needless to say, defense lawyers object to the latest subpoena, and filed a motion to quash it, arguing that these were documents that âthe government has already had ample opportunity to obtain,â so prosecutors should have sought them much earlier rather than in the final weeks before trial.  The defense argues that the subpoena signals a shift in the prosecutionâs theory and should not be enforced at this late date because it would prejudice Mr. Rajaratnamâs defense.   The prosecutors are not alone in sending out a last-minute trial subpoena for documents.  On Jan. 24, Mr. Rajaratnam sent a fourth subpoena to the consulting firm McKinsey & Company for documents related to Anil Kumar, a former director of the firm who pleaded guilty in the case, and Rajat K. Gupta, a managing director of the firm and former Goldman Sachs director whose name surfaced in the case but who has not been charged with a crime.  McKinsey has filed a motion to quash the subpoena, which the prosecutors will no doubt support.  Among the objections raised are that Mr. Rajaratnamâs lawyers had agreed to not seek certain records that are now being demanded, and records related to internal investigations of Mr. Kumar and Mr. Gupta are protected by the attorney-client privilege. Courts are leery of subpoenas issued on the eve of trial because, unlike a civil case, only limited discovery is available in federal criminal prosecutions.  The Supreme Court set forth the governing standard for enforcing a trial subpoena in United States v. Nixon, the case in which the Watergate special prosecutor sought to compel President Richard M. Nixon to turn over the White House tapes that ultimately led to his resignation.    The subpoena can only be issued for evidence that is relevant, admissible at trial and limited to specific documents.  Judges are fond of saying that a subpoena that appears to be a âfishing expeditionâ will be rejected.  Under the Nixon standard, I expect Judge Holwell will quash, or at least substantially narrow, both subpoenas because of the breadth of documents sought. Prosecutors filed a motion, called a motion in limine, asking the court to make preliminary rulings on what evidence should be admissible. This gives some indications about how they want their case to proceed.   They first ask to be allowed to introduce evidence of Mr. Rajaratnamâs compensation from Galleon to show his motive to engage in insider trading.  Of course, when the defendant is a reputed billionaire, his compensation is likely to dwarf anything jurors will earn in their lifetimes, which would not put Mr. Rajaratnam in a favorable light.  Judge Holwell is likely to keep a tight rein on prosecutors if he allows them to use this type of evidence because it can be highly prejudicial — being rich is not a crime quite yet. Prosecutors also asked the court to preclude Mr. Rajaratnam from raising questions about the governmentâs investigative tactics or motives in recording conversations and targeting him in a long-running investigation.  The defense has already questioned the veracity of statements made by an Federal Bureau of Investigation agent in seeking wiretaps on his telephones, and prosecutors do not want the defense to âput the government on trialâ for how it pursued the case, a tactic it views as a diversion from the charges at issue. The government hints in its filing that it may not call Roomy Khan, a crucial cooperator in the case who recorded conversations with Mr. Rajaratnam, as a witness at trial.  Ms. Khan has twice pleaded guilty, one to fraud charges stemming insider trading and once to obstructing the investigation, so her background would provide significant fodder for cross-examination.  It is no surprise prosecutors may not use her at trial, relying on recordings of her conversations to get the evidence to the jury without exposing her to a lengthy interrogation by defense counsel.  Prosecutors also asked that Mr. Rajaratnam not be allowed to question the propriety of using Ms. Khan as a cooperating witness if she is not called, again to prevent him from trying to question the governmentâs motives. The Galleon Group engaged in thousands of stock trades every year, and the securities fraud charges focus on only a narrow slice of those transactions.  Mr. Rajaratnamâs defense is trying to further reduce the governmentâs case by asking the court to prevent prosecutors from introducing conversations with him that did not specifically involve the passing of inside information from an identified source. In his motion, Mr. Rajaratnam argues that an investment adviserâs job is to ferret out information about companies, so general discussions he had about a stockâs prospects would not violate the insider trading laws and so should not be heard by the jury.   He also wants to prohibit introducing evidence that someone speaking with him referenced an unnamed source for information about a company because that does not show Mr. Rajaratnam traded on confidential information if he did not know where it came from.    In effect, if the person did not say the information was confidential and came from a corporate insider, then it should be kept out.  This approach would probably keep out a number of the recorded telephone calls, which are often cryptic and would not reveal the exact source of inside information. The defense wants to minimize the amount of evidence about Mr. Rajaratnamâs many sources of information so that it can concentrate on undermining the cooperating witnesses by trying to show that they are either mistaken about what happened or fabricated testimony in making a deal with the government.  The more the government can portray Mr. Rajaratnam as having a voracious appetite for information, the easier it will be to argue that he did not care whether he committed securities fraud in gathering tidbits from numerous sources. Judges hesitate to rule before trial on whether the types of evidence raised by prosecutors and Mr. Rajaratnam can, or cannot, be put before a jury.  Questions about what should be admitted at trial and how far a party can go in its questioning usually has to be considered in context, so I doubt Judge Holwell will decide these motions now. There is no harm in asking, of course, and each side has given a sneak peak about where they think the trial is headed.
