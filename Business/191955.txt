A commode fit for a Wall Street C-suite has made its way to the unlikeliest of places: a greasy-spoon diner on Manhattanâs Lower East Side. âPower Toilet,â an art project that claims to be an exact replica of the executive bathroom at JPMorgan Chase’s New York headquarters, has been installed at the Greek-owned Olympic Restaurant on Delancey Street. The installation is the work of SuperFlex, an art group from Denmark, in conjunction with Creative Time, a non-profit that arranges public art projects around New York City. âItâs a political project,â said Ann Pasternak, the president of Creative Time. âItâs about making private spaces public. And itâs about the excesses of Wall Street, and saying, âenough is enough.ââ  Itâs not clear how accurate Olympicâs loo look-alike is. (For one thing, there is no designated restroom for executives at JPMorganâs New York headquarters, according to one person familiar with the bankâs floorplan.) But one art blog wrote that Superflex was able to mimic every detail of the bankâs bathroom thanks to an âanonymous inside source who was able to take camera phone photos and make measurements of the space.â To get to the gilded bathroom at the decidedly unpretentious Olympic Restaurant, visitors must walk past Olympicâs 13-seat lunch counter to a faded red door marked with a sign. A dingy concrete staircase lit with a single bare bulb leads to the restroom, which is marked with a small sign about the project. The bathroom itself features a Kohler sink, Crane toilet, and quilted toilet paper, along with a framed print of a potted flower. Therenovation cost more than $10,000, Ms. Pasternak said. The meaning of the piece, according to organizers, has to do with the dissolution of private space and the introduction of democratic public spaces in their place. SuperFlex did a similar project in the Netherlands, installing a replica of the United Nations Security Council’s bathroom in a public park. âAll good art has multiple messages,â said Ms. Pasternak. âYou can trace this piece from Duchampâs urinal and use it as a chance to say, what is art?â Ms. Pasternak said that while JPMorgan shared responsibility with other Wall Street banks for some issues of economic injustice, the installation wasnât directed specifically at the bank or its chief executive, Jamie Dimon. âItâs not about targeting JPMorgan,â she said. âIt could have been any bank.â A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment. The âPower Toiletâ show will close October 16, but the upgraded bathroom will remain in Olympic Restaurant indefinitely. Standing behind the dinerâs 13-seat counter, Spiros Nakos, the 61-year-old owner of Olympic Restaurant, said he was approached by Creative Time at the end of June about placing the installation in his restaurant, which he has owned since 1980 and which is located near the non-profitâs headquarters. Creative Time proposed refurbishing his run-down restroom to Wall Street specs at no cost, and Mr. Nakos quickly agreed. The restroom has been good for foot traffic to the restaurant, Mr. Nakos said, and has given workers a morale boost. âI used to feel embarrassed for people to use the bathroom,â he said. âNow Iâm very proud.â Mr. Nakos said he had only squabbled with the artists behind âPower Toiletâ once, when he wanted to install a sign in the bathroom instructing employees to wash their hands â a requirement of the New York City Department of Health â but was told by the artists that since it wasnât in the plan for the piece, it would have to go outside the door instead. He said that although SuperFlex intended for the gilded bathroom to be available for free public use, he had put his foot down on one key stipulation. âYou have to make a purchase to use it,â he said.
