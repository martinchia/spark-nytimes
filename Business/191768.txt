 UPDATE: Reps for McKay say he’s not at this point attached to direct. Will follow and see what happens.EXCLUSIVE: Warner Bros has gotten back in business with Due Date scribes Alan Cohen and Alan Freedland, in a big way. The studio has just acquired Swear to God, a pitch they will write that has Will Ferrell attached to star and Adam McKay to produce and direct. I’m told it’s a buddy comedy in which Ferrell plays a narcissistic hedge fund manager who thinks he has seen God. The scribes, Emmy-winning writers of King of the Hill and American Dad, are coming off the Todd Phillips-directed Robert Downey Jr.-Zach Galifianakis comedy Due Date, and they also wrote The Reunion for Universal. McKay most recently directed The Other Guys and Step Brothers, both with Ferrell, and he produced Casa de mi Padre, the Spanish-language comedy that stars Ferrell. All of these were done through McKay and Ferrell’s label, Gary Sanchez Productions. The deal was made by WME and Mosaic, which rep the writers and McKay. Ferrell’s repped by CAA and Mosaic.
