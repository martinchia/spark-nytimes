7:45 a.m. | Updated with confirmation from the companies Lehman Brothers Holdings has agreed to buy the stake it does not currently own in Archstone, a sprawling apartment company, for about $1.58 billion. Lehman will buy the remaining 26.5 percent stake from Bank of America and Barclays, after months of negotiations over the holdings. The companies confirmed the deal on Friday. As part of the deal, Lehman will provide some compensation to its main rival for the banks’ stake, Samuel Zell’s Equity Residential. Earlier this year, Lehman agreed to buy half of Bank of America and Barclays’ stake for $1.3 billion, in an effort to prevent them from selling the stake to Equity Residential. Under the terms of the latest transaction, Equity Residential will receive $150 million, the companies said in a news release. It is a somewhat strange turn of events for Lehman, for whom Archstone represents an unpleasant memory. Lehman’s costly takeover of the apartment owner in 2007 — the leveraged buyout was valued at $22 billion — is widely seen as one of the events that led to the investment bank’s collapse during the financial crisis. Still, Archstone is a valuable means for Lehman to repaying its creditors. It plans to eventually take the apartment owner public, using proceeds from the initial offering to pay off some of its obligations. But Bank of America and Barclays were looking for a quicker exit, leading them to consider selling their holdings to Equity Residential. Lehman stepped in, exercising a “right of first offer” with its $1.3 billion offer.   News of the deal was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal online. Advertisement
