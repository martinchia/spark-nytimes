LONDON â The hedge fund Marcato Capital Management urged the Intercontinental Hotels Group on Thursday to pursue a merger after media reports in Britain this week that it had turned down an unknown American bidder. Marcato Capital, based in San Francisco, said combining Intercontinental with a larger hotel operator ârepresents a unique opportunity to reshape the global hospitality industry.â Marcato says it owns about 3.8 percent of the shares of Intercontinental, which owns the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza brands. âWe believe that a combination with a larger hotel operator would have compelling strategic and financial merit,â Richard McGuire, the Marcato founder and managing partner who is known as Mick, said in a statement.  âWe strongly encourage Intercontinental Hotels Group’s board of directors to explore such a combination and engage advisers to conduct a formal process to ensure it evaluates the full range of opportunities available to maximize value,” he added. The Sunday Times and Sky News reported this week that Intercontinental had turned down an offer of 6 billion pounds, or about $10 billion, from a âmystery American suitor.â  Intercontinental has declined to comment on the speculation. Both news outlets suggested that the American bidder might be interested in buying Intercontinental to reincorporate in Britain and avoid higher corporate tax rates in the United States. The strategy, known as an inversion, is increasingly popular and has been a crucial factor behind several recent mergers and proposed deals in the pharmaceutical industry, including Pfizerâs recent failed bid for AstraZeneca. Shares of Intercontinental were up about 1 percent, at Â£23.25, in London on Thursday afternoon.
