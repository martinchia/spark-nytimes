LONDON â SHV Holdings of the Netherlands said Monday that it had offered to acquire Nutreco, the Dutch supplier of animal food, for 2.7 billion euros, or about $3.4 billion, in cash. The deal is expected to provide further diversification for the family-owned SHV, which owns the warehouse club store Makro, as well as businesses involved in oil and gas production, private equity investment and transportation. Under the offer, SHV would pay â¬40 a share in cash for outstanding shares of Nutreco. The offer represents a 42 percent premium to Nutrecoâs closing price on Friday. Shares of Nutreco rose 39 percent to â¬39.20 in early trading in Amsterdam on Monday. âWe consider Nutreco a very promising and exciting company with a good long-term growth opportunity, solid management and company values similar to SHV,â Stephan Nanninga, the chairman of the executive board of SHV, said in a news release. Nutrecoâs supervisory board has unanimously recommended that shareholders accept the offer. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and will be contingent on shareholders agreeing to sell 95 percent of Nutrecoâs outstanding shares to SHV, which plans to delist Nutrecoâs shares after the merger. Nutreco would remain a separate company within SHV after the merger and maintain its headquarters in the Netherlands. âWe are excited about this new step in the rich history of our company,â Knut Nesse, the Nutreco chief executive, said in a news release. âSHV will be an excellent partner, enabling us to maintain our corporate identity, culture, values and organization.â SHV has the right to match any competing offers for the company. If the merger agreement is terminated because of a competing offer, Nutreco will pay a â¬25 million breakup fee to SHV. Nutreco, which is based in Amersfoort and produces animal feed for farming and fish food for industrial fisheries, posted revenue of about â¬5.2 billion in 2013. It employs about 10,000 people in 30 countries. Started in 1896 by the merger of two coal trading companies, SHV, based in Utrecht, has a diversified business including retail outlets and private equity investment. The privately held company employs about 47,000 people in 50 countries. Nutreco is being advised by ING and Leonardo & Company as well as the law firm De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek. SHV is being advised by Lazard and the law firm Allen & Overy. Advertisement
