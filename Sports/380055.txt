Advertisement  The good news for free safety RONNIE LOTT is that there will be no fine for his hit against Miami receiver FRED BANKS last Sunday. Lott drew a penalty for unnecessary roughness, but after reviewing videotapes, the league announced that it had determined the penalty did not warrant a fine because he did not use the crown of his helmet. The 34-year-old Lott said, "I've been doing it for 13 years, playing football just like that." We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
