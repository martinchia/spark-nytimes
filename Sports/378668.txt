Advertisement  AP The Redbirds of the Class A New York-Penn League will move from Hamilton, Ontario, to Glens Falls for one year before settling in New Jersey in 1994, the league president said today.

The New York-Penn League board of directors met in Auburn to approve the move Sunday. The Cardinals wanted to move the team because of poor playing conditions at Hamilton's Bernie Arbour field, Pinckney said. New standardized guidelines for minor league baseball fields go into effect in the 1994 season, and Hamilton was unwilling to make the needed investments, he said. "Baseball was being treated like a second-class citizen," Pinckney said. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
