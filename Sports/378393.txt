Advertisement  He is the Big Eight's leading scorer and a big reason that Missouri is ranked No. 9 in the nation, but when Missouri plays eighth-ranked Oklahoma today, ANTHONY PEELER, who has been averaging 22.8 points a game, won't be in uniform. He was suspended for the game after Coach NORM STEWART learned that he had skipped class a few days ago. "We have agreed to some very strict rules for attendance in class and study hall and tutoring and anything else that enhances a student-athlete's ability to succeed academically," Stewart said. If university officials have their way, Stewart will be losing another senior starter, JAMAL COLEMAN. Coleman, who was suspended after being convicted of participating in a scheme to steal money from the college bookstore, won reinstatement last month when Federal Judge SCOTT WRIGHT ruled that his rights had been violated because the panel that upheld the suspension of the black athlete had no black representatives. On Friday, the university announced that it would appeal the ruling,. "Our principal concern in this has to be what we perceive as the improper intrusion of a Federal court into matters of student conduct," the interim chancellor, GERALD BROUDER said.
