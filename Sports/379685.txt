Entering the final day of the regular season, none of the playoff matchups have been set. Wins by the Rays and the Yankees on Saturday ensured that the American League East winner and the A.L. wild card would be determined Sunday. But the situation in the National League is more complicated: two playoff spots are left, and three teams have the chance to claim them. San Francisco needed to win only one game this weekend to clinch the N.L. West, but the Giants lost the first two to the Padres, cutting their lead in the division to one. The Padresâ two wins, combined with two Braves losses, resulted in a tie in the N.L. wild-card standings. Here is a look at how Sunday could play out, with the Braves playing the Phillies at 1:35 p.m. Eastern and the Giants hosting the Padres at 4:05 p.m. Eastern: 
If  Braves and  Giants win The Giants will win the N.L. West and the Braves will have the wild card. They would then play each other in the division series, hosted by San Francisco. If  Braves lose and Giants win  San Diego and Atlanta will stay tied in the wild-card standings and will play a one-game tie breaker Monday in Atlanta. The Braves won the season series with the Padres to earn home-field advantage. It would be the fourth consecutive year a tie-breaker game was needed to decide the final playoff team. If  Braves lose and Padres win San Diego wins the N.L. West by virtue of winning the season series with the Giants, and San Francisco wins the wild card. If  Braves and  Padres win The most complicated scenario will be set in motion. San Francisco, San Diego and Atlanta will have the same record (91-71). The Giants and the Padres will play a one-game tie breaker for the N.L. West title Monday night in San Diego. The loser will then travel to Atlanta for a one-game playoff to determine the wild card on Tuesday night.
