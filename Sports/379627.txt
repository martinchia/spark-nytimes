Marvin Miller, the founding director of the baseball players union, told Richard Sandomir of The Times on Monday that he was not surprised the National Baseball Hall of Fame passed him over for election, the fifth time it had done so: âThereâs been a concerted attempt to downplay the union,â he said in an interview Monday, referring to the Hall. âItâs been about trying to rewrite history rather than record it. They decided a long time ago that they would downgrade any impact the union has had. And part of that plan was to keep me out of it.â In addition to releasing a statement by Miller, the Major League Baseball Players Association issued a statement by Donald Fehr, its former executive director:  “Once again, Marvin Miller has been denied election to the Baseball Hall of Fame. There can be no question as to the extraordinary contributions that he made to baseball. In the last half of the 20th century no one had a greater or more meaningful positive impact on the game than did Marvin Miller.” And Michael Weiner, the union’s current executive director, said: “On behalf of members past and present of the Major League Baseball  Players Association, I express my frustration, disappointment and  sadness that Marvin Miller today was again denied his rightful place in  the Baseball Hall of Fame. Every person who has benefited in the past  half century from baseball’s prosperity — player, owner, executive,  manager, coach or member of the media — owes a debt to Marvin. Marvin’s  legacy is undiminished by this vote; the Hall, by contrast, once again  squandered a chance to better itself as an institution.” The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
