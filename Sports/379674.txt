The Anaheim Ducks were headed to  Montreal for a rare visit Saturday night, but more significant for Canadiens fans is  the return of Saku Koivu, the Canadiensâ former captain. Koivuâs tenure in that role was mixed. He had a record of perseverance and achievement, but it was complicated by the difficulties of leading hockeyâs most storied team â and the cultural pressures of playing in Montreal, where language can be a politically charged issue. Koivu wore the captainâs C on his sweater for 9 of his 13 seasons in Montreal, the last in 2009, when the Canadiens let his contract expire. A Finnish center, he was the teamâs first European-born captain and served the second-longest tenure of any captain in Montrealâs proud history, after Jean Beliveau. Koivu, now 36, was an undersize warrior (5 feet 10 inches, 178 pounds) who worked tirelessly and skillfully, scoring at least 20 goals in five seasons while playing though numerous leg and shoulder injuries. His vision was permanently damaged by an errant stick in 2006. In September 2001 he was struck by lymphoma and underwent aggressive treatments that were expected to sideline him for at least the season. But he returned for the final three regular-season games and inspired the Canadiens in a playoff upset of arch rival Boston. But Koivu never hoisted the Stanley Cup, considered by some in Montreal an indictment of his leadership abilities, despite the mediocre talents of the teams around him. Last week, he told La Presse of Montreal that not winning the Cup was âmy only regret.â He added a second regret when he said he also wished he had learned to speak better French. It was not only the lack of a championship that tainted him for a segment of fans. They judged his acknowledged discomfort speaking the language in public as unpardonable for a captain of le bleu, blanc et rouge. The language issue in Quebec has long been a complicating factor for the Canadiens. It is thought the club cannot hire a coach or general manager who is not at least bilingual (as all of them have been over the last 40 years), and that narrows their search considerably when those posts must be filled. Captains, too, are expected to try, at least, to speak French. Koivuâs successor as captain is Brian Gionta, a Rochester native. âI canât make promises that Iâll be able to speak it fluently, but Iâll try,â he said when named captain. Earlier, Bob Gainey, Mike Keane and Kirk Muller  learned French with varying success. But Koivuâs reluctance in public appearances to speak whatever French he knew was a sore point. It even became a topic at a provincial commission hearing on language issues in 2007. And yet, as Koivu learned, all that can be transcended when the team wins. He calls the fans connoisseurs of hockey. âThe relationship I forged with fans of Montreal is special,â he said. âWhen you win, itâs fun to walk downtown and smile at everyone.â Slap Shot, the New York Times hockey blog, reports on the Rangers, the National Hockey League and anything that glides quickly across a frozen surface anywhere on the globe, from the snowy prairies of Saskatchewan to the frigid steppes of Russia and beyond, like, say, Phoenix.
