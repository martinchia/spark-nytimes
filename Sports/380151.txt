Advertisement By JOSEPH DURSO George Steinbrenner pledged a kinder, gentler world for the Yankees yesterday, promised to communicate more directly with his players, scolded his fellow owners for overspending on salaries and even guaranteed that Bucky Dent would survive the season as manager. ''Yes, I'll tell you Bucky's going to be my manager all year,'' Steinbrenner said. ''Bucky's one of my guys. He's won everywhere he's been. He's very strong on loyalty. We're going to keep this guy for a while.'' Then, reminded that Dent was his 17th manager in 17 years and that a vote of confidence had often turned into a kiss of death, Steinbrenner put his position even more emphatically: ''Bucky Dent will be here as my manager this year. If they get off to a bad start or a great start, or a great start and can't hold it together, he's still my manager.'' Dent, sitting alongside while the owner was hitting some rhetorical long ones during an upbeat luncheon at the ''21'' Club, was asked why No. 17 would last longer than No. 16, Dallas Green, who lasted from April to August last season. Choosing his words, Dent replied: ''I've been in the organization 12 years and wanted to be the manager. But I'm going to do what I think is best. I don't worry about tomorrow.''

He defended the signing on merit, but upbraided Gene Autry of the California Angels for signing Mark Langston at $3 million a year, Ewing Kauffmann of the Kansas City Royals for signing Mark Davis at $3.25 million and Al Rosen of the San Francisco Giants for rehiring Will Clark at $3.75 million. ''Every day,'' he said, ''I wake up and see the salaries and say: ''I don't believe this.' They blame me for Perez, but that's an easy cop-out. My people told me he was the pitcher they'd want if the game was on the line.
