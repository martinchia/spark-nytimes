A quick review of the changes on the Jets’ coaching staff and elsewhere: Brian Schottenheimer, Jets offensive coordinator: Parted ways with the teamÂ after six seasons without securing another job. His father, Marty, may get the head-coaching job at Tampa Bay, in which case the two could work together again. Brian Schottenheimer drew the ire of fans as few figures have recently in New York sports. (The former Mets pitcher Oliver Perez comes to mind.) His fourth-quarter play-calls at the goal line in Pittsburgh in the A.F.C. title game last year put him on especially shaky ground with fans heading into this season. The 67 drop-backs by Mark Sanchez in a Week 16 loss against the Giants confirmed that he wasn’t in sync with Rex Ryan’s offensive philosophy. Although the Jets’ offense was ranked No. 25 this season, it was ranked 13th in points scored (thanks to terrific efficiency in the red zone), only 4 Â points out of the top 10. Tony Sparano, fired as Miami’s coach last month: Will reportedly join the Jets as their offensive coordinator. He gave Miami’s offense life with the Wildcat in his first season, in 2008. But the team’s offensive ranking has dipped since, from No. 12 to No. 17 to No. 21 to No. 22.  Bill Callahan, Jets offensive line coach: Hired by Cowboys for the same position. He probabaly would have stayed with the Jets had he been offered the offensive coordinator position. Callahan oversaw the Jets’ ground game, which had great success in 2009 and 2010. Â At Dallas, he will replace Hudson Houck, who is 69 andÂ retiring after 29 seasons in the N.F.L. 

Mike Mularkey, Atlanta offensive coordinator: Hired to be the coach of the Jaguars. Schottenheimer was in the running for this position. It’s probablyÂ no coincidence that news of Mularkey’s hiring precipitated the Jets’ moves. Hue Jackson, fired as Oakland’s coach: Has an association with Rex Ryan from their days as assistants at Baltimore. The Jets could be a landing spot for him as he looks for an assistant coaching job. The Jets’ wide receivers coach, Henry Ellard, and the assistant defensive line coach Jeff Weeks are also gone. Their contracts were up. Statement from Brian Schottenheimer:
âAfter much thought and consideration, I have decided not to return to the New York Jets in 2012. I am very proud of what we have accomplished in the six years I have been here. I am grateful for the relationships that I have with our players and coaches and appreciate the hard work and dedication that went into our success. My family and I would like to thank Rex Ryan and the entire Jets organization and wish them continued success. I look forward to the exciting opportunities that lie ahead.â Statement from Rex Ryan:
âBrian and I talked, and I understand his decision to look for a fresh start. Iâd like to thank him for all of his contributions these past three seasons. Heâs been right there with me, shoulder to shoulder, and played a key role in our success, helping us to reach two A.F.C. Championship games. As Iâve said before, coaching is in his bloodlines, he has a tremendous work ethic and I consider myself fortunate to have worked with him. He has acquired a lot of experience at a young age and has a bright future in front of him. I know that he will be a successful head coach one day — probably sooner than later.â Extra point This is how Ben Shpigel described the tension between Schottenheimer’s preferred offensive approach and Ryan’s: This season, there seemed a disconnect between his philosophy and Ryanâs vision, which involved a power running game and Sanchez playing a complementary role. That approach worked in 2009, when the Jets boasted the best defense and running attack in the N.F.L. But when both units faltered, Sanchez was not equipped to have the offense flow through him, and the Jets sputtered. Despite Ryan’s passion for the ground-and-pound running game, the N.F.L. is becoming a passing league. What kind of offensive system would you like to see the Jets adopt? Update: Several anonymous Jets are quoted by Manish Mehta of The Daily News as saying that the Jets are coddling Mark Sanchez and that they should trade for Peyton Manning if at all possible.
