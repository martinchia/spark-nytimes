In a recent article from the Chicago News Cooperative, Dan McGrath writes about Jim Edmonds as an example of a player where statistics fail to tell a complete story of a player. Edmonds, known for his dazzling catches that helped him win eight gold gloves, retired from baseball last week after 17 seasons. McGrath writes: Somewhere thereâs a number that quantifies how good Edmonds was in the outfield, a number more esoteric than fielding percentage, putouts, assists â the usual suspects. Thereâs just as likely a number that will suggest he wasnât any good at all, that other metrics like his range factor or his total zone runs or his win-probability-added donât measure up to the immortal Willie Tasby. Numbers. They are the lifeblood of baseball, but I fear we have gone too far in our attempts to quantify everything that happens on the diamond, from a pitcherâs ground-ball frequency to a hitterâs productivity when the moon is in the seventh house and Jupiter aligns with Mars. McGrath spoke with Steve Stone, former major league pitcher and now a television analyst for the Chicago White Sox, about some examples where numbers may not be truly reflective of a playerâs value. âI donât need numbers to tell me Derek Jeterâs range has declined. I can see that,â Stone said. âI also see him positioning hitters so well that he only has to take three steps to get to a ball, whereas a shortstop with better range, so to speak, might need six steps. And I know Derek is going to pick up the hard two-out grounder in the eighth inning. You want the ball hit to him. He wants the ball hit to him. Not everybody is like that.â What other players can you think of, from the past or present, where the numbers do not always reveal what a player’s real worth is? Join the conversation below, where you also have full permission to tell us why Derek Jeter is the most overrated player in the history of the game.
