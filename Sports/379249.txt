WIMBLEDON, England â All eyes were glued to Bethanie Mattek-Sands like the tennis balls to her sleeves as she made her way from the locker room to Court 14 Wednesday for her first-round match against Misaki Doi of Japan.  Mattek-Sands, the No. 30 seed, turned the path running through the grounds into a runway, unveiling a white zippered jacket with a collar. She collaborated on it with Alex Noble, a fashion designer whose clients include Lady Gaga.  Starting on the shoulders and running down each sleeve were 12 tennis ball halves â white, of course, in keeping with Wimbledon tradition.
  Upon arriving on the court, Mattek-Sands turned her back to the net and posed for photographers, who were yelling instructions to her as if she were standing on the red carpet at a Hollywood premiere. At one point she turned to a W.T.A. official who who was taking in the scene and said, âIâm not hitting a ball in it so donât worry.â  After several seconds, a smiling Mattek-Sands turned back to the court and slipped out of her jacket, which also featured white cowgirl fringe across her back and chest, to reveal her tennis outfit: an Under Armour form-fitting white tennis dress with a long sleeve on her left arm and no sleeve on her right arm.      Mattek-Sands was not smiling when she left the court. Her first appearance in a Grand Slam as a seeded player lasted a little over two hours as Doi pulled off a 6-4, 5-7, 7-5 upset.  She broke Doi’s serve in the 11th game of the second set with a deft drop-shot volley.  The point was a ray of light at the time. She trailed by a set and was within two games of defeat. Seizing her advantage, she worked her way to two set points at 40-15. She won the second and squared the match at a set apiece.      Besides the jacket, Mattek-Sands wore black eye paint with a downward streak on the outer corner of each cheek. Serving to stay in the match, she fell behind 15-40. She staved off one match point with an overhead winner, but on the next point Doi drew her to the net with a short shot and Mattek-Sandsâs return sailed wide. As Doi celebrated the victory, Mattek-Sands approached the chair umpire and asked plaintively, almost desperately, âThat ball was out?â       She shook hands with Doi but not the chair umpire, grabbed her jacket and racket bag and was gone. Resurfacing more than an hour later to speak with a group of American reporters, Mattek-Sands said: âI was just upset over that call.  I thought it was a lot closer than it really was.â She added: âObviously you’re in the heat of the moment, so that was just my opinion. But that was â obviously thereâs no challenge on that court, so it wasn’t going to happen.â         Mattek-Sands described the result as âdisappointingâ but tried to reclaim the perspective that escaped her in the heat of defeat. âYou know, the worst thing that could happen was I lost first round, and I’m still here and I’m O.K.,â she said. âI’m still confident in my game.  I’m feeling good.â   Additional reporting by John Martin.
