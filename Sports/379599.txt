 To the Sports Editor: Re “A Revolutionary Surgery, Now as Typical as a Sinker,” March 8: The death of Dr. Frank Jobe raises awkward questions. How different is having Tommy John surgery from using steroids? And if the steroid age puts asterisks in people’s minds, should not the same be true of the period of “Frankensurgery”? John was simply not the same pitcher after he had ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction, which is now becoming elective. If there is a steroid era, there should be a Tommy John era; it is all performance enhancement that extends careers. John pitched until he was 46: Should all of his postsurgical wins be counted equally? SOL GITTLEMAN Winchester, Mass.  To the Sports Editor: Now that the doctor has died, I propose that we start referring to his revolutionary and career-saving procedure as Frank Jobe surgery. The inventor should get the credit. PAUL MILES-MATTHIAS Seekonk, Mass. A ‘Civilized Tie’ To the Sports Editor: Re “Game With No Winner Ends in Shared Title,” March 10: How refreshing to read that after a 1-1 tie and seven overtimes, the officials declared the two finalists in the Ohio hockey state championship game co-champions, without resorting to some silly shootout to produce an arbitrary winner. If two teams are still level after 101 minutes of play, let their equality be recognized with a civilized tie. Advertisement The best sporting results are ties or draws, for they celebrate the balance and harmony of true competition, a word that means a striving together, not a childish zeal for one-upmanship. Advertisement PETER BRODIE Palo Alto, Calif.  To the Sports Editor: Apparently some fans will not be happy until players drop dead from exhaustion. After regulation play and seven overtimes resulted in a 1-1 tie, one fan said he “felt sorry for both teams” because “somebody had to win.” Well, there were winners in that Ohio high school hockey title match between St. Ignatius and Sylvania Northview. Among the winners were common sense, sportsmanship and the concept that adult leaders can make wise decisions for the health and safety of teenage boys.

But the biggest winners of all are the players. They played all-out for 1 hour 41 minutes. So the result is a tie? That only goes to show how good each of these teams must have been. The title should be proudly shared. At the very least, they’ve given players, fans and schools something to argue about for years to come — in a good way. WILLIAM D. SCANLAN Silver Spring, Md. A Welcome Burst of Tradition To the Sports Editor: Re “In a Native American Sport, a Family’s Giant Leap,” March 10: The Thompsons are even more revolutionary than the article portrays. For years, lacrosse has slowed considerably as teams have opted to control the game with long, conservative offensive possessions. The trend is so drastic that calls for installing a shot clock grow louder each year as final scores dwindle. SUNY Albany has built an offensive machine that stands apart because of the explosive output of the Thompsons, who play with a zeal that reflects the importance of the game to native culture. That is what lacrosse needs right now. MATT R. WELCH Raleigh, N.C.
