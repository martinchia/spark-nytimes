Fate, and a new business endeavor, brought Heat guard Dwyane Wade to Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday, just as a critical round of N.B.A. labor talks got under way. Even from 20 blocks away, Wade seemed pessimistic about the potential for a breakthrough. âIâm confident that we have constant meetings now,â Wade said, adding, âBut obviously, weâre a long way aways still.â Wade was in town to promote Court Grip, a new product aimed at helping basketball players at every level avoid slipping on the court. Wade is in partnership with Mission Athletecare, which invented it. Wade said he has been in regular contact with Billy Hunter, the executive director of the players union, about the state of negotiations. But he said he felt no need to join the meetings himself, and he shrugged off the criticism directed at superstar players for their lack of involvement.  âThatâs a silly thought,â Wade said. âIâve been in a few meetings â Iâve been in three or four meetings myself.â But none of the leagueâs top players have been a regular presence since the lockout began July 1, with the exception of Chris Paul, who serves on the unionâs executive board. It has been suggested that a greater presence by the gameâs superstars could push the N.B.A. toward a deal. Wade disagreed. âThe negotiation is the negotiation,â he said, adding: âWeâve been in there. Not only have they said their shpiel, weâve said our shpiel, weâve listened. Weâve taken notes. Weâve done all this. And we believe in our players association.â To that point, Wade also gave unqualified support to Hunter and the union leadership, which has come under fire from some high-powered agents, who disagree with the unionâs strategy. âBilly is someone who we trust, someone that has been through this before, someone that we lean on a lot,â Wade said. âAnd he stays in constant communication with all of us.â Instead, Wade blamed the owners for taking a hard line in negotiations, with demands for major salary reductions and a hard salary cap. âItâs hard to have a conversation with somebody or talk to somebody if they turn their back toward you and theyâre not listening,â he said.
Wade also confirmed that he and his Miami Heat teammates â LeBron James and Chris Bosh â have organized a charity exhibition game to be played at Florida International University. The game will be held Oct. 8, barring a resolution to the lockout. The league has canceled a week of preseason games and postponed training camps indefinitely. More cancellations are likely later this week if no deal is reached. âWhen they decided to cancel certain preseason games and training, it was like, O.K., we have to continue to move forward with the game of basketball,â Wade said, âand trying to find ways to play basketball and keep our community involved, keep our fans excited.â He added: âWeâre in a lockout, weâre not in a strike. The players, weâre ready, we want to work.â
