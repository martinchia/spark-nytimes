Advertisement  Not to sound like a broken record, but racing was canceled at Aqueduct again yesterday and for the usual reason: snow. It was the seventh time this year that the track's seven-race card and the five-race simulcast from Gulfstream Park had been disrupted because of seasonal weather. That puts Aqueduct on course to beat the mark established at last year's winter meeting when 11 days of racing were canceled or disrupted by the weather. Counting two days last month, when racing at Aqueduct was called off after two or three races, the 1993-94 meet's cancellation tally stands at nine.
