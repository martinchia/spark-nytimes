Advertisement By WILLIAM N. WALLACE In 1949 at Yankee Stadium, JOE DiMAGGIO was given a special day and a gift from the fans, a 22-foot Chris-Craft powerboat named Joltin' Joe. Never one for boating, DiMaggio gave the boat to his brother VINCE, who eventually gave it to a cousin, a fisherman who died recently. The vessel, suffering from lack of maintenance, is now beached at Martinez, Calif., the hometown of the DiMaggio family. BARRY WYSLING, the harbormaster there, has a plan. He has launched a campaign to raise $7,000 to restore the boat and mount it as a monument at the entrance to the city's marina. There is no question about title. A check of records revealed that Joe DiMaggio was listed as the owner. Wysling got in touch with him, requesting that Joe make a gift of the battered cruiser to the city. Several weeks later, DiMaggio appeared at the marina and signed the papers. "He was very nice about it," Wysling said. "A quiet gentleman. And he autographed a baseball for me."
