When Indianapolis was selected to host the 2012 Super Bowl in 2008, many wonderedÂ if the Colts would be the first team to play for the Vince Lombardi Trophy on their home field. Instead, the Colts are in disarray after a 2-14 season. Their coach is gone. Their general manager is gone. Their longtime president is gone. And soon, perhaps, their star quarterback, Peyton Manning, may be gone, because of a troublesome neck injury that may or may not be healing. Yet, Manning isnât going quietly; he is dominating Super Bowl week in a city he has dominated since he joined the Colts in 1998, appearing asÂ an ambassador for the city despite his tenuous status as a resident. Mike Chappell of The Indianapolis Star called Manning âthe very large elephant in the very large room.â  Jeff Arnold at Yahoo Sports noted:Â âHere, where Manning led a franchise from the shadow of Baltimore moving trucks into a literal palace, it’s not about spats and headlines. It’s about an era of good feelings, closing quickly.â It would be easy to interpret some of Manningâs comments about his health and desire to play again as lobbying to stay with the team â and receive a $28 million bonus to boot. If he believes his career with the Colts is over, perhaps he is using his very public chats with the news media to signal to other teams that he still has gas in the tank. But maybe Manning is just doing what is expected of him as the most recognizable hometown pro player since Reggie Miller was a Pacer. Manning is a smooth speaker and a smart operator, able to rebut rumors that his career as a quarterback is over in one breath and pat his younger brother, Eli, on the back in the next. Good thing it was Super Bowl media day on Tuesday. Otherwise, Eli, Tom Brady and all the other players actually in the Super Bowl might not have had a chance to be heard. But this year thousands of reporters were not the only ones to hear the players answer endless questions about rivalries, injuries and facial hair. For the first time, the N.F.L. sold thousands of tickets to the public, at $25 a pop, so Joe Fan could watch the spectacle of a spectacle. As my colleague Bill Pennington wrote in The Times, âFor maybe the first time in media day history, hucksterism went unheeded.â The N.F.L. has mastered the art of ending the season with a bang, forcing fans to focus on football while sucking all the sports-related oxygen out of the room. This year it might be for good reason. The N.H.L. is stumbling back from its All-Star break and, as Bill Simmons at Grantland.com noted, the quality of play during the truncated N.B.A. season has been uneven. Despite some of the sloppiness, television viewership is up, and a flood of young stars is emerging. Alas, theyâll continue to be overshadowed as long as Peyton & Co. are talking. The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
