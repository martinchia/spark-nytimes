Advertisement  Five Grade I stakes races at Belmont Park today and tomorrow will showcase many of the sport's top runners and determine the favorites for most of the Breeders' Cup races at Belmont on Oct. 27. The card today includes the $838,500 Jockey Club Gold Cup, the $636,000 Champagne for 2-year-olds and the $289,000 Frizette for 2-year-old fillies. The Gold Cup drew a field of six with Izvestia, the 3-year-old Canadian Triple Crown winner, the likely favorite going a mile and a quarter against Flying Continental, De Roche, Lay Down, Thirty Six Red and Steinlen. The Champagne attracted a large field of 13. Deposit Ticket, the Hopeful winner, and Fly So Free, making his first start since July, are the favorites. In the Frizette, Meadow Star will be an overwhelming favorite to remain undefeated in her sixth start. Both races are at one mile. Tomorrow's stakes are the Beldame for fillies at a mile and an eighth and the Turf Classic at a mile and a half for grass males. Go for Wand, the nation's top 3-year-old filly, will face four moderate older fillies in the Beldame. With Approval, a stablemate of Izvestia's and last year's Canadian Triple Crown winner, heads a field of six in the Turf Classic that also includes El Senor, Alwuhush and Cacoethes.
