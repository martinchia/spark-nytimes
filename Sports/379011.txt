Saturdayâs Manchester United-Liverpool game (7:45 a.m., ESPN2, ESPN3) is the marquee matchup this weekend, and yes, we will be watching. But what will you tune to after Luis Suarez and Patrice Evra have finished slugging it out and/or hugging it out? Here are a few all-American options for you. All times Eastern. Saturday Believe it or not, Evertonâs match against Chelsea (10 a.m., Fox Soccer Channel) could be Landon Donovanâs final Premier League appearance for the Toffees and his second-to-last game for the club â gulpÂ  â ever. Donât take our word for it: Look at the schedule, which shows that February is a very slow month for Everton. And this piece includes an unequivocal quotation from a certain strong-willed general manager and coach that suggests the Los Angeles Galaxy expect the attacking midfielder back in California on Feb. 26. Doesnât it seem like Donovan just arrived in Liverpool? And, once again, doesnât it seem like he simply belongs in England? Enjoy Donovan in Everton now, Anglophiles, because it looks as if it is all about to end.  There is no end in sight for Clint Dempsey, however. Dempsey, Fulhamâs 28-year-old striker, cannot stop scoring, and every time he lines up for the Cottagers he showcases his lethal combination of grit and guile. The dilemma: Fulhamâs home contest against Stoke City (10 a.m., Foxsoccer.tv) and the Everton match start at the same time. Do you watch Dempsey, or Donovan? Donovan, or Dempsey? Since Everton is on TV and Fulham is online, consider a multiple-screen morning: watch the Toffees on TV and the Cottagers on your laptop or tablet. Given the protracted negotiations and work permit application and visa procurement exasperation, Tim Reamâs move from the Red Bulls to Bolton Wanderers took longer than expected. But Ream, the 24-year-old center back, is now ensconced in northwest England and appears on the verge of making his English debut this weekend. âThe three new lads will certainly be in the squad,” Bolton Coach Owen Coyle said through the clubâs Web site. “Everything was sorted with Tim’s passport and work permit on Monday, so he is in contention.â If he sees action, Reamâs European adventure will begin with a match against Wigan Athletic (10 a.m., Foxsoccer.tv), currently in 20th place in the 20-team E.P.L. Whatâs the deal with George John? The former â and future? â F.C. Dallas defender landed in London on loan to West Ham United, currently in first place in the English Championship. But the Greek-American defender has not featured for the Hammers, and his two-month deal expires March 5. Will he get a chance to show his stuff this weekend against Peterborough (10 a.m., Foxsoccer.tv)? Or, will Coach Sam Allardyce go with the same starting lineup he used last week in a game Big Sam labeled, âThe best win Iâve ever hadâ? While most of the United States national team starting spots seem settled, there are plenty of questions about the central attacking midfield role. Will Stuart Holden reclaim the role? Might Michael Bradley move forward? Could Landon Donovan shift into the center of the pitch? Or, will Jose Torres make a move? Torres, a gifted but inconsistent performer, is riding a wave of good form right now and is worth a look as Pachuca takes on Estudiantes Tecos (8 p.m., Telefutura) in the Mexican Primera Division. Sunday A few months ago, Eric Lichaj was still sidelined with a serious hip injury. A few weeks ago, Lichaj seemed likely to leave Aston Villa in favor of Leeds United, the second-division team he played for last season. Now, with the transfer window closed, Lichaj is still with Villa and will face an uphill battle as he attempts to fight his way into Alex McLeishâs lineup. Lichaj, a speedy 23-year-old right back, probably helped his chances by featuring at left back in a midweek reserve match, and it will be interesting to see if he gets a sniff of the pitch against Manchester City (11 a.m., Fox Soccer Channel) this weekend.
