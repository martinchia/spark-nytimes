Throughout the college wrestling season, The Quad will follow some of the country’s top-ranked teams.  STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — Penn State continued to do what it has done all season — dominate. The second-ranked Nittany Lions capped off their Big Ten schedule Sunday afternoon in front of another sold-out crowd at Rec Hall. The most recent victim to fall to Penn State was 12th-ranked Michigan.   Penn State, the defending national champions, won eight of 10 matches to cruise to an easy 34-7 victory. The win also gave the Nittany Lions a share of the Big Ten regular-season dual meet championship, a title they will share with the Minnesota Gophers.  Both teams finished Big Ten play with identical 7-1 records. The Gophers came to Happy Valley in November and gave the Lions their only loss of the season.  Penn Stateâs 7-1-conference mark this season sets a school record for Big Ten wins in a season. Since the Nov. 20 loss to the Gophers, Penn State has blown through the competition. They were able to avenge their only conference loss to the Gophers by beating them in the Southern Scuffle tournament held in Chattanooga, Tenn., over New Yearâs. Penn State won the tournament while Minnesota took second.   And while coach Cael Sanderson and his team said after Sundayâs win that while it is always nice to win a trophy, the team has bigger goals in its sights. âWe are real happy with it,â Sanderson said. âObviously, if you win any kind of Big Ten title, itâs a great conference with a lot of tough competition so we are happy.â Sanderson said that he places more emphasis and importance on the Big Ten tournament that will be held the first week of March at Purdue.  But that did not stop the raucous crowd of 6,671 from celebrating Sunday afternoon. And the home team gave their fans plenty of opportunities to do so, especially in the final three bouts of the dual.  Defending national champion Quentin Wright clinched the dual win for his team. The 184-pounder blasted Michiganâs Hunter Collins to the mat and finished off the pin at the 4:22 mark. But it was red-shirt freshman Matt Brown who garnered the loudest applause of the day. Brown wrestled in place of freshman Morgan McIntosh, who was held out of a second straight dual for precautionary reasons after injuring his knee last weekend. Before the match, Brown was weighed in at 174 but for the second time over the weekend he wrestled at 197-pounds. Giving up over 20 pounds, Brown won both of his weekend matches. It was Sundayâs match that was the more dramatic and impressive win, however.   Michiganâs No. 15 Max Huntley took a shot at Brown with 30 seconds to go in the third period and the score tied at 1-1. But Brown was able to counter the shot and get a takedown. âYou do notice it when you get in on a shot, itâs a little harder to finish,â Brown said after the match Sunday.
Brown received the loudest ovation of the day from the crowd and his effort did not go unnoticed by his teammates.  Freshman Nico Megaludis said some people may not know what to expect from Brown because he has not had very many opportunities this year, but said they will understand once they see him wrestle. âTo wear someone out who weighs 20 pounds more than you,â the 125-pound Megaludis said, âthat is so hard, and he did it twice in one weekend.â Cameron Wade then followed Brownâs effort by pinning No. 10 Ben Apland of Michigan at the 3:58 mark to close out the dual. It was Megaludis that got things going for the Lions in the first match of the day. Michigan took its only lead of the afternoon when top-ranked 141-pounder Kellen Russell had a major decision against Bryan Pearsall. The lead did not last long, however. Top-ranked and undefeated 149-pounder Frank Molinaro posted a 6-1 decision over No. 7 Eric Grajales. The win tied the dual and the Nittany Lions would not lose a bout the rest of the afternoon. Dylan Alton put Penn State in the lead for good right before the intermission. Alton chose down to start the third period and was able to quickly escape and hold on for the win. The win gave Penn State a 10-7 lead. Following halftime, top-ranked David Taylor continued his dominance this season at 165-pounds. Taylor posted a 15-0 technical fall to remain undefeated this season. Second-ranked Ed Ruth also continued to hammer his opponents and went on to post a 12-1 major decision over No. 8 Justin Zeerip. The win was the Lions second of the weekend. Friday, Penn State went on the road and defeated the seventh-ranked Nebraska Cornhuskers, 31-6.
