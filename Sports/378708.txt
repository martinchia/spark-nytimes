 The Florida Panthers selected defenseman Aaron Ekblad with the first pick in the N.H.L. draft Friday night in Philadelphia. The 6-foot-4, 214-pound Ekblad, an 18-year-old from Belle River, Ontario, played for Barrie in the Ontario Hockey League. He is the first defenseman to go No. 1 since St. Louis took Erik Johnson in 2006. The Buffalo Sabres selected center Sam Reinhart with the second overall pick. He is the son of the former N.H.L. player Paul Reinhart. The Edmonton Oilers selected center Leon Draisaitl with the third overall pick. The Calgary Flames took center Sam Bennett with the fourth pick, and the Islanders picked forward Michael Dal Colle fifth. The Islanders also took Joshua Ho-Sang, a right wing/center, 28th, on a pick acquired from Tampa Bay. The Devils took center John Quenneville with the final first-round pick. In the hours before the draft, Anaheim acquired center Ryan Kesler from Vancouver for center Nick Bonino, defenseman Luca Sbisa and the 24th overall pick.
