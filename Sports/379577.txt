The Mets know things are not great at Citi Field. Attendance dropped again last season as they finished with a losing record for the third consecutive season. Revenue fell from virtually every source.  On Wednesday, Standard & Poorâs, the credit rating agency, took notice. It changed its near-term outlook from stable to negative on the $695.4 million in bonds issued on behalf of Queens Ballpark Company, a Mets subsidiary, to build Citi Field.   S&P maintained its BB+ rating on the bonds even as its outlook soured, which was based on decreasing attendance, the recession and local competition for club seats and luxury boxes. In early 2010, the agency downgraded the rating to below investment grade, or junk status, citing the bankruptcy of the bondsâ insurer. The change to a negative outlook is not likely to affect bondholders much. But in general this type of action by a credit agency can serve as a leading indicator of a future cut in the bond rating.  In its report, S.&P. said that Queens Ballparkâs revenue fell 12 percent in 2011, led by a 22 percent drop in critical club seat revenue dedicated to repay the bonds. Revenue from merchandise, food and beverages fell 20 percent last season, the report added. S.&P. examined Queens Ballparkâs unaudited financial report through November. S.&P. also described as âaggressiveâ Queens Ballparkâs preliminary projection that attendance will rise to 2.5 million in 2012 from 2.29 million last season. It said that attendance was likely to keep falling and that a third of its luxury suites are up for renewal in 2012. In the report, Jodi Hecht, an S.&P. credit analyst, said that Queens Ballpark received about 44 percent of its revenue from short- to medium-term contracts for luxury suites, club seats and advertising, a lower percentage than other stadiums. That, she said, causes financial volatility because of a dependence on game-day revenue. Club seat revenue makes up 41 percent of Queens Ballparkâs revenue. Advertising and naming rights, which feature a 20-year deal with Citigroup, account for 37 percent.
