Advertisement  Kennedy 41, Canarsie 27 John F. Kennedy of the Bronx tried for a 2-point conversion after its first touchdown against Canarsie yesterday, a 1-yard run by quarterback Jose Marimon, but the pass attempt failed. Little else went wrong for Kennedy after that. On subsequent touchdowns, the defending Public Schools Athletic League champion Knights (3-0) went back to the reliable leg of Frank Nagy, and the Hungarian-born all-city and all-state place-kicker nailed five extra points in the 41-27 victory over Canarsie (2-1). The officials at Kennedy's field had to move the teams to the other end of the field for a couple conversions because one of the goal posts had been vandalized.
