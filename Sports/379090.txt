 The Native American brothers Miles and Lyle Thompson, the Albany stars who each broke the Division I lacrosse record for most points in a season, are co-winners of the Tewaaraton Award. The trophy, given to the best player in the nation, was awarded at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of the American Indian. The Thompsons are the first Native Americans to win the Tewaaraton (pronounced DAY-wah-ALLAH-DOON) and the first players to share it. Lyle had 51 goals and a record-tying 77 assists for 128 points. The previous record was set by Steve Marohl (37 goals, 77 assists) of Maryland-Baltimore County in 1992. Miles, a senior, finished the season with 82 goals in 18 games, matching the Division I record for goals in a season set in 1990 by Jon Reese of Yale. Miles also had 37 assists for 119 points. Taylor Cummings of Maryland won the women’s award. A version of this brief appears in print on May 30, 2014, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Brothers Share Award.
