When the Astros new owner Jim Crane said the team would consider changing its nickname, speculation immediately turned to what that new name could be. But instead, why not take a look at other teams who have a similar move. The last baseball team to stay in the same city but change its nickname (other than shortening it like the Tampa Bay Devil Rays did before the 2008 season) was: The Astros in 1965. Originally named the Colt .45s, the team featured the future Hall of Famer Joe Morgan (who hit .189 in 37 at-bats during the final season with the .45s name) and very little else. When Judge Roy Hofheinz became the teamâs sole owner he moved them to the newly built Astrodome and renamed the team the Astros, each in honor of Houstonâs connection to the space program. The team now finds itself named after a stadium it no longer plays in and on the verge of changing not just divisions but also leagues, so the timing for a change would seem reasonable. With just two names in franchise history, the Astros cannot compete with a team like the Dodgers. Without leaving Brooklyn, the team remembered as the Dodgers (or Dem Bums depending on your point of view) was known as the Atlantics, the Grays, the Bridegrooms, the Grooms, the Bridegrooms (again), the Superbas, the Dodgers, the Superbas (again), the Robins and finally the Dodgers. In the 53 years since moving to Los Angeles, the various owners have never seen fit to return to any of the previous nicknames, regardless of their merit. As for the kings of continuity, there are still two original American League franchises that have been in the same city with their original name since 1901: the Chicago White Sox and the Detroit Tigers. In third-place for longest tenured franchise/city name are the Mets, which is better than the team has done in the standings since 2008. It remains unlikely that any name change will occur, as moves like that are costly and often unpopular, but until then it is fun to think of what the team could choose. One suggestion: It is unlikely that Houston would get any pushback from the Dodgers should they try to resurrect the Bridegrooms.
