Advertisement By MIKE FREEMAN and  This is the time of year when being a football coach is like being a traffic cop. Take Dan Reeves, for instance. Not only does he have to deal with trying to direct his team off its bumpy preseason road, he must now take the Giants through the complicated and winding path that is the process of cutting players. This is not easy stuff. Reeves said today that the Giants haven't yet made any final decisions regarding the roster, but they do have a pretty good idea who is getting cut for good and who will be cut with the idea of bringing the player back for the inactive or practice squads if he clears waivers. Teams must reduce their active rosters to the 47-man limit by noon on Monday. Like many other teams, the Giants have plenty of tough decisions to make. And not just with who will remain. This week Reeves will also decide whether Kent Graham or Dave Brown will be the backup to quarterback Phil Simms, as well as who has won the starting job at right cornerback (Phillipi Sparks vs. Perry Williams) and at free safety (Lamar McGriggs vs. Myron Guyton). Reeves said he would announce these decisions on Wednesday. Long Discussions "We talked about all of the possibilities for all of these things," Reeves said of his daylong session with the coaching and personnel staffs. "We have a pretty good idea of what we're going to do." Advertisement They talked for hours because the process is a long and difficult one. Rules stipulated by the new collective bargaining agreement say that teams can keep 58 players (the Giants have 59). There is the 47-man active roster, a six-man inactive squad whose members can later move up to the active roster, and also a five-man practice squad composed of rookies. Guard Eric Moore doesn't count since he will serve a four-game suspension by the National Football League after pleading guilty in an Atlanta court in the off season to possession of steroids. Advertisement Who is in danger of being cut for good? There are some notable veterans who could go. Running back O. J. Anderson, a potential Hall of Famer, has survived many cuts in his 15 seasons. But this season looks particularly tough for him since the coaching staff loves the younger Kenyon Rasheed, who is a good receiver as well as runner and blocker. Defensive lineman Eric Dorsey is also on the endangered list, since he has been out most of camp with a severe hip problem. The coaches simply haven't seen him do anything, and in the Reeves era what a player has done in the past has little bearing on the present. Then there's linebacker Steve DeOssie, who has had a good camp but could get caught up in the numbers game. There are Alternatives But there's a catch to all of this. Say the Giants cut these 12: Anderson, DeOssie, Dorsey, wide receivers Eric Weir and Keith Crawford, tackle Greg Bishop, guard Scott Davis, defensive end Mark Flythe, tight end John Brandes, defensive back Willie Beamon, linebacker Andre Powell and Rasheed. They could bring back any six of these players for their inactive squad, with Rasheed and Powell being at the top of the list. "That's what we're trying to figure out," said Reeves. "The guys we like at 47. The guys we like at 53. The guys we like at 58. There are so many different things to look at."  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

It's clear that one way or the other, Jesse Armstead, the rookie outside linebacker, will make this team. Do the Giants take up a spot on the 47-man roster to make room for him or do they waive him and seek to bring him back to the six-man team, risking that another team might snatch him off waivers? The same scenario exists for Rasheed. Do the Giants keep DeOssie and Brandes, both long snappers, or cut one of them? And when Reeves is done with the roster shuffle there is the actual on-the-field stuff to worry about. Namely, the number of mistakes the team has made in the preseason. In the 23-17 loss to Miami on Saturday night, for instance, the Giants had 11 penalties for 91 yards in comparison with the Dolphins' 4 penalties for 25 yards.  To say that this concerns Reeves would be a serious understatement. "There are two things to me that as a coach you can't stand," said Reeves. "Guys not hustling and guys making mistakes."                    --------------------       PUNTING AGAINST RED INK MIAMI, Aug. 29 (AP) -- The battle for the Miami Dolphins' punting job has a peculiar financial sidelight -- bankruptcy court. Advertisement Reggie Roby, who has been Miami's punter for 10 years, has declared bankruptcy, citing an overall debt of $488,683. But if he makes the team, he will earn $445,000. Dale Hatcher, who is challenging Roby, is counting on a $200,000 salary to save him from bankruptcy court. Hatcher is set to get married this week if he makes the team. If he doesn't survive the final cut, the wedding will be delayed. "Everything is being taken into consideration," Coach Don Shula said.
