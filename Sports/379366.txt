Advertisement  Unless there is a dramatic increase in ticket sales, the football game tonight between Grambling State and Howard University, the first meeting between the schools, could be the only time the Whitney M. Young Jr. Classic will be played in Giants Stadium. The problem for this game between the predominantly black colleges is that Giants Stadium, in East Rutherford, N.J., is less accessible by mass transit than Yankee Stadium. The grass at Yankee Stadium was chewed up during last year's Classic, which Grambling lost to Central State of Ohio. Rain later caused further damage, and the Yankees balked at holding the game at the Stadium this year. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
