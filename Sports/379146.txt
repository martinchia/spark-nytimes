CreditStuart Palley for The New York Times         LOS ANGELES —  It’s called puck luck, and it would seem to be an appropriate phrase for some of the bounces, deflections and goal-line theatrics that threaded their way through the Stanley Cup finals. For instance, with a little more than a minute left in overtime in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup finals Friday, a funky hop put Dan Girardi’s shot on goal, and the Rangers took a half-dozen swipes at the rebound. They could not convert, and Los Angeles Kings goalie Jonathan Quick froze the puck with a snow angel pose, one spectacular save on the way to a 3-2 victory in double overtime and the second Stanley Cup title in three years for the Kings. They had manufactured a bit of their own luck with a fortuitous sequence early in Friday’s game. They stormed the Rangers’ goal mouth, where Lundqvist made three saves in succession before Justin Williams squeaked a backhander through him, three Rangers defenders and two other Kings. In Game 4 at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday, it was the Rangers who seemed to have more than a little bit of good fortune when two pucks came to a screeching halt on Lundqvist’s goal line, including one with just over a minute remaining that was swept away by Derek Stepan. That made a significant difference in the Rangers’ 2-1 victory, which averted a four-game sweep. After that game, Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault referenced “the hockey gods” at the Garden for helping to keep his team alive. Lundqvist more or less agreed with his coach, saying, “Your game you can control, but there’s also so much out of your control.” Advertisement Lundqvist said that luck could not be relied on all the time, “but there are moments in games where the difference is so small, that little extra push might help you to get the win.” Advertisement Still, on Friday, before Game 5, Kings players did not necessarily agree that luck was cause for concern.

I’m a true believer in you get what you put into it.” Brown said he thought luck had little to do with the two pucks that stopped right on the doorstep of the Rangers’ goal in Game 4. “I know that if we’re harder in those areas, then they’re in the net,” he said. Maybe so, but the Kings themselves had benefited from some fortunate sequences in this series that were almost quirky in the way they played out. In their 3-0 victory in Game 3, at the Garden, the first period was scoreless as it drew to a close when the Kings’ Jeff Carter let fly with a shot that hit Girardi’s skate and flew past Lundqvist with 0.8 seconds left on the clock. The goal seemed to take the life out of the Rangers. Two nights later, in Game 4, it was Carter who swiped at, and missed, the first of the two pucks that ended up right on the Rangers’ goal line. “You just control what you can control and that’s getting ready for a game and that’s your shift when you get on the ice,” the Kings’ Mike Richards said before Friday’s game. “You say bounces, you can say distractions, you can say whatever, but you just control what you can.” A version of this article appears in print on June 14, 2014, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Talk of Puck Luck Bounces Both Ways for Both Teams.
