Early in his career, Andy Murray frequently named the United States Open as his favorite tournament. His choice of something other than Wimbledon seemed to have a certain pointedness. Because Murray is Scottish, it was easy to wonder if there was a nationalist edge to his choice. But as he reminded The Independent this month, the feeling grew from his days playing juniors at the Open. âWe got to stay in a really nice hotel there,â he said. âWe got to eat in the playersâ restaurant, and I got to see some of my idols. I remember seeing Tim Henman and Roger Federer before they played in the semifinals. I got to see Andre Agassi having his dinner, and things like that.â By contrast, at Wimbledonâs junior tournament, Murray once said, âyou had to stay in a hostel.â

Over the last 12 months, Murray has broken through every barrier, defeating Federer on Wimbledonâs Centre Court to win the Olympic gold medal, following it with his first Grand Slam title in New York last September, and then, in July, becoming the first British man to win the Wimbledon title in 77 years. So has all this fulfillment changed his feelings about the United States Open? Maybe. Murray now refers to his Wimbledon victory as the sweetest of his accomplishments. This is certainly understandable, given the pressure he has been under, since he reached the third round of Wimbledon as an 18-year-old wild card, to finally deliver to the British public a title there. Murray, seeded third, opens his United States Open title defense on Wednesday night against Michael Llodra of France. Murrayâs habit of proclaiming the United States Open his favorite may have been early evidence of his comfort with multinationalism. After all, as a junior player, Murray decided he had to leave Scotland for Barcelonaâs SÃ¡nchez tennis academy, in search of more advanced coaching and more court time. The decision came after a conversation with his childhood friend Rafael Nadal. His current hitting partner and assistant coach, Dani Vallverdu, is a friend from the SÃ¡nchez academy. He has employed a string of non-British coaches, the latest and most successful of whom is Ivan Lendl, a Czech-American. Their relationship has thrived on a shared sense of independence of mind. In general, Murray, who maintains houses in Florida and England, has embraced a fully international life. Contrast this with American players like John Isner and Sam Querrey, who acknowledge that they do not feel as comfortable or play as well when away from the United States. Perhaps a deeply individualistic personality has helped Murray transcend his countryâs sometimes pessimistic stereotypes regarding the British inability to win in the end. He has won by understanding himself as an international tennis player, rather than a British athlete. Having achieved two folkloric victories for his nation in the last year, he is now widely expected to be knighted. Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
