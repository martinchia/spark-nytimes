ST. LOUIS â When Albert Pujols came to bat in the seventh inning of Game 6 of the World Series on Thursday night, the St. Louis Cardinals were losing and on the brink of elimination, and Pujols had not had a hit since his three home runs in Game 3. At that point, there seemed a very good chance that it could have been Pujolsâs final at-bat of the game, the season and perhaps his Cardinals career. After 11 years in St. Louis, Pujols was looking at becoming a free agent after the season. So the fans at Busch Stadium stood and gave him an ovation, as much an attempt to salute his career as to persuade him to stay longer in this baseball-loving city. Pujols struck out then, but he did come to the plate again, in the ninth inning, and hit a double to left-center to start the first rally that would lead to the Cardinalsâ improbable comeback victory in that game, and the second World Series title in Pujolsâs career. A day later, after he had been up on the championship podium erected on the field after the Cardinalsâ 6-2 victory in Game 7, Pujols was asked if, after that experience, he could imagine being anywhere else but St. Louis.  âI donât think thatâs a question right now that you should ask,â he said. âRight now itâs just enjoying the moment, man. Just sitting at first base with three outs left and just thinking about all the things that we went through this year as a group, just how special this group of guys that we have are. You know, and to be able to do that and just bring another championship title to the city of St. Louis, itâs just amazing.â Pujols may not have wanted to discuss his future, but the subject was on the minds of Cardinals fans and many of his teammates as well. After Game 7, the veteran outfielder Lance Berkman, who won his first World Series in 13 seasons in the major leagues, said he asked Pujols to stay so they could do it again next year. But Pujols would not give Berkman, or the public, a clue about his plans. âI told him just the same thing that I am going to tell you,â Pujols said. âI was enjoying the moment. Listen, Iâm going to be prayerful about it. Whatever decision I make hopefully is the best decision I make for my family and the fans and everybody.â He finished by saying: âTo talk about my contract right now, thatâs the last thing that Iâm thinking about. Iâm just kind of letting everything come in and the game that we won today.â Pujols, perhaps the best hitter in baseball, could command a contract in the vicinity of $200 million, and many expect that deal to come from St. Louis. Since his first year, 2001, when he was the National League rookie of the year, Pujols has a .328 career batting average with 445 home runs and a 1.037 on-base plus slugging percentage. He was the N.L. most valuable player three times, made nine All-Star teams and won two World Series. In the 2011 World Series, he hit only .240 with three home runs and six runs batted in, and had only one hit, the double, after Game 3. But in that game he joined Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson as the only players to hit three home runs in a World Series game, and he became only the second player after Paul Molitor in 1982 to have five hits in a Series game. But what he spoke of most after the game was the happiness he had for his veteran teammates winning their first World Series, like Berkman, Octavio Dotel, Arthur Rhodes and Rafael Furcal, and the way the Cardinals came together to win it all. âThe last two months of the season, including the postseason, were unbelievable,â he said. âI think the best moments of my career pretty much because just the way that we did it, the way that we got in and the way that we finished, weâre the world champions. Itâs pretty special.â No one knows right now, but those special memories and feelings might just be enough to get Pujols to go back to St. Louis. That, and a whole lot of money.
