David Beckhamâs days in Major League Soccer are apparently not over after all. The president of the French club Paris-St. Germain, which had been trying to lure the 36-year-old Beckham back to Europe with a deal paying a reported $1 million a month, said Tuesday that Beckham would not be joining the club. âWe feel a little disappointed,â PSGâs Qatari president, Nasser al-Khelaifi, told reporters at the Qatar Open tennis tournament. âBut both sides agreed it would be better that we not do the deal.â Khelaifi said Beckham would instead return to the Los Angeles Galaxy, the club he led to the M.L.S. championship last season in the final year of a five-year contract that paid him $6.5 million a year. A newspaper in England reported that Beckham would sign a new deal with the Galaxy âwithin the next week,â news that Khelaifi appeared to confirm. âBeckham is in Los Angeles, and heâs going to stay there,â he said. Beckham has made no secret of his desire to play for Britain at this summerâs London Olympics, which was why many had assumed he would move back to Europe after his Galaxy contract expired in November. But family considerations played a role in his decision. Beckham and his wife, Victoria, have four young children, the last of whom was born in Los Angeles last year, and his family is said to have enjoyed living in Southern California the past five years. A Galaxy spokesman said the team would have no comment about the reports. But PSGâs sporting director, Leonardo, who coached Beckham when he played on loan at A.C. Milan in 2010, confirmed that Beckhamâs proposed move to France was off. âDavid was very interested in coming to Paris,â he said. âBut the welfare of his family in Los Angeles, the wish not to change everything in his life, weighed heavily.â Any deal with the Galaxy will almost certainly include provisions that would allow Beckham to return to England to prepare for and play in the Olympics, provided he is named to Britainâs team. The Games will be played during the M.L.S. regular season. The Galaxy open preseason training Jan. 20. Their home opener will be March 10. The PSG move also might have been a long shot for commercial reasons; the club is sponsored by Nike, and Beckham has had a long relationship with Adidas.
