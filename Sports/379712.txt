David Waldstein’s article this morning  examines the wildly divergent styles of Bill Belichick and Rex Ryan on conference calls. Ryan is gregarious and always tries to throw in a few laughs. Some of Belichick’s answers can be just as funny, unintentionally so, as he refuses to open up or take any bait from reporters. See for yourself.   Transcript of Bill Belichick’s conference call with reporters Wednesday: On how much better he feels the offense has been since going to a âsmall ballâ approachâ¦ I donât know.  Every week is its own week.  Weâll see how it goes this week.  We have our pluses and some minuses along the way, but in the end, none of that really matters.  It just comes down to how we do this week, so weâll see how it goes.

On some of the things that concern him most about the Jetsâ¦ Theyâre a good football team all the way across the board.  Theyâre good on offense, defense (and) special teams.  (They) beat the Colts in Indianapolis.  We all know how tough that is.  Everything concerns me.  Theyâre good all the way across the board.

On whether he has noticed any difference in Mark Sanchezâs play latelyâ¦ Heâs done a great job this year.  There have been a lot of close games and (he has) brought them from behind, like in the Detroit game and the overtime games.  (In) Cleveland, he made a bunch of big plays there.  Heâs done an excellent job in some tough situations and brought the team back and won for them.  I think anytime a quarterback does that, thatâs what you want on your rÃ©sumÃ©. On whether he saw a change in the Jets style of play after they got behind in the last game they playedâ¦ I think, if thatâs what they said, thatâs the answer to the question right there.  Theyâre the ones that are on their side of the field.  They know what they were doing and how they felt and what they felt like they did, so Iâd go with that. On whether he has any issue with how Tom Brady celebrates after a scoreâ¦ No. On how much he used pictures of the Bills being fitted for Super Bowl rings as motivation when he was defensive coordinator for the Giantsâ¦ I really donât even remember being aware of that story about the rings.  If it was, Iâve forgotten about it, but I donât remember. On four of the 12 playoff teams having general managers that worked under him at some point and what he tried to teach them about building a teamâ¦ I think those individuals are all very talented and theyâve done a great job in their situations.  They did a great job in my association of working with them in different capacities along the way.  I think they, obviously, have done very well.  They did a great job for me.  Each situation, each team, each one is a little bit different, so I think in the end, it comes down to just doing the right thing for your team, making good decisions and finding a way to put the best team on the field.  Theyâve all done a great job of that. On whether he is proud of having people that work with him go on to success with other teamsâ¦ Sure.  I have a lot of friends in the business at that end, on the coaching end, players that Iâve coached and so forth, but when you compete against them on the field, then thatâs competition.  You have to put all that aside and compete.  Then, when itâs over, you can go back to resuming whatever degree of friendship you have there, as long as it doesnât conflict with the continued competitiveness of the situation. On what he thinks of Darrelle Revisâ¦ Heâs an excellent player.  He has had a great career and weâve seen him have a lot of great games against a lot of great receivers.  He competes very well against a lot of different receivers.  He did it again against the Colts.  We know heâs an outstanding player and weâll just do our best to compete against him.

On Antonio Cromartieâs comments towards Tom Bradyâ¦ Iâm really trying to focus on getting our team ready to play on Sunday.

On Cromartie as a cornerbackâ¦ Heâs had a good career.  He played in San Diego.  We saw him out there and (then he) came to the Jets.  Heâs done a good job there.  Heâs a big corner who can run well and has good ball skills.  The play in the Baltimore game, he made an excellent play on the ball and made a great kickoff return last week.  It was a huge play against Indianapolis.  It really put the team in a close position to score and then they got a couple more first-downs (for) the winning points.  He can hurt you in a lot of different ways.  Heâs a good football player. On how much emotion goes into executing on game dayâ¦ There are so many things that go into executing on game day.  If you wrote a book, you still couldnât include all of them.  Itâs really a combination of a lot of things and how it all comes together.  Itâs a long game that takes place over three-plus hours.  Whatever it is, a lot of things happen within that span of time.  How it all comes together is all very unique and thatâs what makes football such a great game.  Emotions are a part of it and so are a million other things. On Deion Branch saying the Patriots made a lot of mistakes in their 45-3 win over the Jetsâ¦ Youâll have to ask Deion about that specifically.  I think after every game there are always that you do well, hopefully, and there are things you donât do as well and need to correct or make adjustments to.  Thatâs pretty common after every game.  The Jets are a good football team.  They certainly cause a lot of problems. Weâve played four games since Rex has been there.  We split on all four of them.  We made some plays, they made some plays. In the end, both teams have won two games.  We know itâs a very competitive situation.  There are things we always want to try to do better. They give you problems in their schemes, their players, their coaching (and) in all three phases of the game, as I said earlier.  We have a lot of respect for them.  We know there are a lot of things we have to do well in order to come out on top. On if you can coach emotionâ¦ I think you try to coach a team the best that you can.  As is said, thereâs a million factors that go into that.  They are all important. On if the game is personal to himâ¦ Weâre going to do our best to win on Sunday. On if heâs going to have a pregame race with Coach Ryanâ¦ I think weâll do our best to win on Sunday.

On the advantage of having many different personnel groupingsâ¦. I think in every game, youâre always looking for matchups . You try to create the ones that you feel give you an advantage and try to minimize the ones that you think donât give you an advantage or give your opponent an advantage.  However you want to look at it.  I think thatâs part of every game, whether itâs offense, defense (or) special teams. It really transcends through any sport.  You try to find matchups that are advantageous. If you can find them, you try to utilize those and get the most out of them.  If you donât think thatâs the case, you try to move on to something thatâs better for you.

On how theyâve used their two tight ends to create favorable matchupsâ¦ We try to do it with our whole team, itâs all the players that are out there.  Each of your linemen, each of your skill players, all of the guys on defense that you have to defend on the other side of the ball.  Itâs a constant challenge.  Part of the competition is trying to put your players in a position where they can be successful on different plays and to try to do the same with your opponent.  (You want) to keep their playmakers from making a lot of plays against you.

On what it means to be a part of five 14-2 teamsâ¦ Thereâs time to reflect on things, but right now Iâm just trying to focus on the Jets and get ready for this Sundayâs game.  We can talk about all that other stuff later. By contrast, here is the transcript of Rex Ryan’s news conference Wednesday: REX RYAN

Opening remarks
Damien Woody is going to be placed on IR. He got an Achilles’ injury in the other [left] leg. Itâs really unfortunately. He played almost the whole game [at Indianapolis]. I mentioned he was a little wobbly. Well, there was a reason. It wasnât his knee, itâs an Achilles’ tendon, so he will be placed on IR today. Guys that did not practice today were Brandon Moore [back], Brad Smith [groin] and Patrick Turner [illness]. Guys that were limited were Santonio Holmes [quad], James Ihedigbo [knee/ankle] and [Darrelle] Revis [hamstring]. Guys that were full were [Antonio] Cromartie [groin], Ben Hartsock [back], Nick Mangold [shoulder], Sione [Pouha, back], Tony Richardson [finger], [Mark] Sanchez [right shoulder] and Bryan Thomas [ankle]. Those are our injuries. On the sweater vest traditionâ¦

Well, I was trying to cover up the boiler. I thought that was the best way to do it [laughter]. Thatâs really where it came from. I saw it and said, âLetâs go with that.â On the fans in the stands copying the sweater vest styleâ¦ Well, it’s a style that should be copied. Itâs a good look. I could see why they would want to have that look [laughing]. On when he found out Woody was hurtâ¦ He actually never finished. It was on the last drive and he came out. I never knew the extent of the injury. Obviously he didnât either. I guess heâs going to that surgery maybe this afternoon. Itâs unfortunate. He played great and played the whole game against Robert Mathis, who is a great player. On how it feels to have Woody hurt during last couple weeks of the seasonâ¦ Itâs tough. He worked his tail off to get back and then he had a great challenge against Mathis. He did a great job during that game. Now, getting ready to play his old team New England and what all that represents, itâs tough. Weâre fortunate. Iâve always said that we have the best backup tackle in the league in Wayne Hunter. Heâs played a lot of football for us and we have a lot of confidence in Wayne.

On if Woody tore his Achilles’ tendonâ¦ I donât know. On how far Mark Sanchez has come since last yearâ¦ Itâs huge. His confidence is really huge. I think that comes with his knowledge of the system, how he feels about his teammates and being able to recognize defenses. Heâs way a head where he was last year. On Antonio Cromartieâs comments towards Tom Bradyâ¦ I think that language was a little strong for me [laughing]. You shouldnât like who you are up against right now. This is the playoffs. I can tell you our whole football team respects Brady and the Patriots. Thereâs no question, but hey, we donât like any of them right now. You shouldnât. Danny Woodhead is a great kid, but I canât stand Danny Woodhead right now. I think thatâs just part of it and trust me, the feeling is mutual. Mike Tannenbaum is from UMass and you know theyâre saying some bad things about Tannenbaum this week. It is what it is. I think you just want to play the game. On if he has been disrespected by Tom Bradyâ¦ Disrespect? No. Brady is a great competitor and if he can stick it to you, heâs going to. Just like weâre going to do to him if we get the chance, and anybody else. He is a great, fierce competitor. The great thing about Brady is that he thinks heâs going to win every game. That sounds really familiar because I know thatâs how I feel. I think weâre going to win every game and he feels the same way. He gets to go out and prove it on the field. I get to watch. On who is the better quarterback, Peyton Manning or Tom Bradyâ¦ I would like to have either one of them. Sanchez, I hope can be that kind of quarterback one day. You know my thing with one and one A. Remember how that went over so well when I got here [smiling]? Thatâs where Iâd put them â 1 and 1-A. On which quarterback is 1 and which is 1-A… I donât have any idea. Iâll let you figure that one out [laughter]. On if Brady points at the opposing team after he scoresâ¦ Yes. Absolutely.

On if Brady pointing is a regular thingâ¦

I think so because he does it so frequently. Heâs mastered it [smiling]. On if the talk between the Jets and the Patriots is overratedâ¦ I have a feeling the motivation for New England to beat us has nothing to do with me. Just like our motivation to beat New England has nothing to do with anyone there. We want to win to advance just like they do. After the game they can blow it up to be whatever it is. Thatâs the truth. Thatâs the reality of it.

On if Bradyâs fistpump is different than other quarterbacks’ celebrationsâ¦ I think so. He was definitely looking over there for some reason. I donât know if he was looking for somebody. My job is to keep him from doing that. On if Brady’s fistpumping is a form of tauntingâ¦

Yes and it should be penalized. On if the Patriots will target Cromartieâ¦ I think [Darrelle] Revis guaranteed victory this week [laughing]. Go ahead and call it, Revis [laughing]. Thatâs what Iâm looking at. He did it. I heard him say it so go ahead and do it. All I did was guarantee a Super Bowl this year so I wouldnât worry about just one game. How about just laying it out there for everybody. On his speech quoting Hernan Cortezâ¦ I just stole it from somebody. I think what I do is go off of the little knowledge I do have that Iâve gained through history classes. You pick up things along the way during your career. I thought that was the appropriate message at that time.

On if there comes a point where he thinks the team talks too muchâ¦ No. Everything Iâve ever said is because I have a strong belief in our football team. Iâve gone into every game in my life thinking Iâm going to win and weâre going to win. I have belief in myself. Iâve said it before, I believe in myself, but more importantly, I believe in the players that I coach and I believe in the assistants that coach with me and this organization. If Iâm saying something, Iâm just stating a fact. I believe our football team will win. It doesnât matter if itâs last week, this week or any week from here on out. Thatâs just the way I feel. Iâve never ripped an opponent, at least publicly. They can be great. If somebody beats us, they have to be unbelievable. They have to be one heck of a football team and thatâs how I feel. On Patriots CB Devin McCourtyâ¦ I donât know if you necessarily want to pick on that rookie from Rutgers, McCourty. How many picks does he have? Is he going to need to intercept 20 balls before people stop throwing it at him? I donât know. Heâs done a great job. He makes big plays. The thing thatâs the most impressive stat about the Patriots is the plus-28 turnover ratio. Thatâs an incredible stat. I think itâs the second-best in NFL history or close to it. Their formula is simple. They get ahead of you, you have to try to catch up, and when you do, you make mistakes. Thatâs why the yardage is a little misleading when you look at their defense. Their defense is 25th in the league, but itâs much better than that. They force turnovers. The other thing is their nine scores on returns, the five by their defense, the two kick returns, a punt return, a blocked punt for a touchdown. Those are impressive numbers that maybe arenât in the regular numbers but that you certainly notice going against them.

On if he has ever worked for an organization that has asked him to tone his personality downâ¦ Probably everybody I have ever played for or coached, but nobody asked me before. When I was a defensive coordinator I would say the same things, but instead of having this many reporters, there may have been one or two. Thatâs about it. Now itâs just a bigger stage, but I was still the same person then as I am now.

On having a week for the safeties to practiceâ¦ It certainly helps that you have had longer to prepare for them. We will see if it makes that big of a difference. I certainly hope it does.

On how it felt to lose Jim Leonhard before the last game against the Patriotsâ¦ It was tough, thereâs no question. He was basically the quarterback of our defense. The one thing that it did was it made Brodney Pool learn the defense instead of just relying on that one guy. Brodney has played exceptionally well since that injury. Sometime you lean so much on a guy because he knows the system and you wait for him to tell you what to do. Now Brodney is like, âWell, I have to learn it.â Brodney has done an outstanding job for us as of late. On Pool going 1-on-1 with top receiversâ¦ Anytime you have a safety covering a wideout or a receiving tight end, I donât know if comfortable is the right word but he certainly can do the job. Heâs as athletic as any of the safeties out there.

On if Sanchezâs preparation for Sunday is different than the preparation for the last game against the Patriotsâ¦ We have moved past that game, but we are certainly going to look at it and learn from it. I think the big thing is saying how poorly he played fell right into line. When youâre down 100 points, youâre going to make mistakes. That probably had more to do with it than anything else.

On if he spoke to Cromartie about his comments towards Bradyâ¦ No. I did say that they now have someone they dislike more than me [laughter]. I felt pretty good. On if Brad Smith will play on Sundayâ¦ We expect Brad to play. If he doesnât play, youâre obviously not going to have the Wildcat like you would if he was in there. Heâs such a threat back there in that role because he can throw it and he can run it. He has great ballhandling and can throw the option pass and shovel pass. I certainly hope he can play.

On if Cromartie will be used for kickoff returns even if Smith is availableâ¦ No. If Brad can go, he led the league in kickoff returns, I would keep Brad in that role if heâs 100 percent.

On if the players need to win their 1-on-1 matchups to beat Bradyâ¦ Thatâs part of it. If you put us in that situation, he gets rid of the ball so fast that youâre not going to get sacks. Itâs as simple as that. Youâre not going to sack him. You want to disrupt him. You want to disrupt the timing of it where heâs not comfortable. You want to get hits on him. The thing about Brady is heâll stand in there until the last second and heâll throw the ball, where some guys are rhythm quarterbacks â one, two, boom, shoot it out. Heâll wait and heâll take the hit. Heâs not going to try to knock you over like [Ben] Roethlisberger does and just come by and smack the guy. You can get more hits on Brady. The longer he has to throw, thatâs tough. We have to do a great job finishing our rushes without question and hopefully not let him have that kind of timing. The guy was as hot as Iâve ever seen him and unfortunately we were on the receiving end of it. On how concerned he is about Brandon Mooreâs injuryâ¦ I think Brandon will be fine. He kind of tweaked his back in the weightroom. Everybodyâs going, âOh, thereâs another weightroom injury.â He was just do some exercise for his back and he tweaked it.
