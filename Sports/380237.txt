The New York City Marathon made me smile this week. And then it made me frown. The frowning came when I heard there is talk of two marathons on the same weekend somewhere down the line, to accommodate all the people who want to traverse the five boroughs.  I just want to know: which race are we supposed to love, to gush over the human spirit and the diversity of human body types? The Saturday marathon or the Sunday marathon?  It is thoroughly charming when New York adjusts its traffic flow and its sleep patterns to cluster along thoroughfares to cheer for the runners who made it through the lottery and got accepted. But two spectacles on back-to-back days? More traffic diversions? Fuhgeddabout it. But I must admit, the Marathon also made me smile when I heard (and read) the new credo of the Marathon, called Run for Life.  Normally, I am super resistant to advertising and marketing and branding. I watch commercials for the pretty women and never notice the product. But the New York Road Runners, with their super salesperson Mary Wittenberg, have come up with a new logo (the runner breaks free from the apple!) and a new statement, courtesy of the Doublespace advertising company, and a committee of writers, including Michelle Sassa, who wrote the original draft.   It is sort of a chant or a rap. You can find it by pressing this link. One favorite line was: âRun off dessert.â I remember my friend and colleague Ira Berkow telling me he ran with the thought of cheese danish foremost in his mind.  My other favorite line was, âRun because endorphins are better than Botox.â I laughed, not because I know anything about Botox (itâs just a word I hear in chatter) but because I am a true believer in endorphins. When I was a five-mile Turkey Trot plodder, I exulted in the rush of benevolence and joy that kicked in around the 10th training lap on the high-school track on a late afternoon in fall. There is nothing like that runnerâs high. I miss it since my knees told me to switch to cycling and walking and kayaking. There are still endorphins kicking in, but nothing like stride for stride, outdoors.  Run for Life captures the reasons we run. It also captures the reasons we stand alongside the course in the five boroughs and cheer our heroes, our role models. But one day a year, please. Donât dilute this beautiful event. Your thoughts?
