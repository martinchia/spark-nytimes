Advertisement  MARK DUFFNER, who coached Holy Cross to a perfect 11-0 season in 1991, received a five-year contract yesterday to revive the University of Maryland program. "Our goal is to bring Maryland football back into a position of prominence," said Duffner, who will receive a $120,000 annual base salary. "But it won't be a quick fix." Duffner, 38 years old and from Annandale, Va., replaces JOE KRIVAK, who resigned Dec. 6 after compiling a 20-34-2 record, including 2-9 in 1991, in five years as the Terrapins' head coach. Holy Cross has the longest winning streak in college football at 20 games. Duffner's Crusader teams also graduated 91 of 95 seniors and had three academic all-Americans.
