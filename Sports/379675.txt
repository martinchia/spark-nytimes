Live analysis and game coverage of the N.F.L. wild-card playoff game between the Jets and the Colts. The game is a rematch of last year’s A.F.C. championship game, won by the Colts.  The big question tonight is whether the injury-depleted Colts team of this season is weaker than the one that beat the Jets last year. And if this year’s Jets learned enough, and improved enough, after last year’s disappointment to come back and write a different ending. What do you think? Follow our Saints-Seahawks liveblog until the game, or read about master motivator Rex Ryan to get your juices flowing. Then check back for updates throughout the night.



11:28 P.M. A wild ending to a wild day
 The Seahawks’ victory over the Saints earlier today was fun, but the last few minutes of Jets-Colts had more swings than an elementary school playground. — With 3:10 left and the Jets clinging to a 14-13 lead, the Colts forced a punt — only to run into the kicker and give the Jets a first down. Crucial seconds ran off the clock, and it appeared the Jets were in position to put the game away. — On third-and-5 with 2:51 left, the Jets guess right on a blitz, but Sanchez overthrows an open Braylon Edwards on the right side, and the Colts get the ball back after all. — Peyton Manning, as he has done so many times, coolly moves his team into position for a field goal against the Jets defense. And Adam Vinatieri, as he has done so many times, coolly bangs it through. The Colts take a 16-14 lead with 53 seconds to go, and it looks like another week of Same Old Jets handwringing is coming up. –But Antonio Cromartie returns the ensuring kickoff almost to midfield, and suddenly the Jets have a lifeline. A catch by Edwards shortens the distance for Nick Folk, and he knocks through a 32-yarder as time expires. Jets win!! Wow. What a day. Ryan on the finish: “Our offense had to pick up our defense again. That’s how we’ve played all year.” Ryan on winning in Indianapolis after losing there last year in the A.F.C. title game: “What a great feeling. An amazing feeling.” Ryan on the return of the Ground and Pound running game, and how it helped quarterback Mark Sanchez. “It was more of giving him a chance back there. Their two ends are tough, and that big tackle made a couple of plays. Once we got in a groove we were able to protect him.” Jets at Patriots, 4:30 p.m. As a wise man once said, get yer popcorn ready. Folk wins it!!! Slips his kick inside the right upright from 32 yards and the Jets have won, 17-16. Rex Ryan, forgetting how big he is, jumps in the air like a high school cheerleader! But he’s got his win over Manning, his revenge for last year, and his team in the second round of the playoffs. What was it that Ali said? It ain’t bragging if you back it up. After a run and a timeout (odd calls both), Sanchez finds Edwards down the right sideline and — with a brief nudge to free himself — rises to make an 18-yard catch at the 14. From a 49-yarder to a chip shot in seconds. Three seconds left. Sanchez won’t have as far to go now. They’ll start at their 46. Will Folk have a chance for a response? As perfect as he always is. With 53 seconds left, the Colts take a 16-14 lead. He’s so money the Jets didn’t even try to ice him. Colts at the 35. Manning just seemed to be toying with the Jets. They’re at the 32 now as they take their final timeout with 1:02 left. A third-down play, then Vinatieri — then an early bitter winter for one of these teams. The Colts cross midfield on a run by Addai to set up a sprint to the finish. It’s tough to overstate how big a moment that was for Sanchez there. Drop the ball in Edwards’s hands, and you’re the hero. Instead, the Colts have two minutes for one of the best quarterbacks in N.F.L. history to drive about 20 yards to set up the best clutch kicker in N.F.L. history. And Sanchez overthrows Edwards streaking behind his man down the right side. Gutsy call against a blitz. And it would have worked, if Sanchez had made the throw. So instead of a first down and a chance to run out the clock, the Jets give the ball back on a touchback with 2:36 left. Smith, a rookie from Syracuse, was the one who ran into Weatherford. Spent most of the year on the practice squad, and probably wishes he was still there right now. A catchable ball from Sanchez on third-and-5. And he drops it. But the Colts let him — and the Jets — off the hook by running into the kicker. Five yards, first down. The Jets, not Manning, get the ball back with 3:02 left. Ouch. That stings. Hope he wasn’t watching. Jets totals this half: 20 runs, 7 passes, 14 points. Vinatieri hits from 32 after the running game peters out at the 14. Jets 14, Colts 13. Next score wins? With less than five minutes left, this may be the fastest moving N.F.L. playoff game in the television era. It’s moving along faster than a Koufax shutout. Reggie Wayne’s not seeing the ball because Rhodes and Addai and running so well with it. And so often. Rhodes: 11 carries, 27 yards. Addai: 11 carries, 57 yards. Reggie Wayne has one catch for 1 yard. All night. The Jets have to give the ball back. Manning’s been sitting on the sideline for what seems like forever, mumbling, “I’ve got next.” Well, he’ll get a chance to show everyone what he can do now. One of the easier scores of his career, a stroll over the right side. Untouched. The Jets take a 14-10 lead, their first of the night. It wasn’t so much a drive as it was a migration: 17 plays, 87 yards, 9 minutes and 54 seconds. Sanchez finds Keller over the middle on second down. First and goal at the 3. The clock ticks inside 11 minutes in the fourth quarter. First down: Greene stuffed at the 1. Second down: Tomlinson stopped for no gain. Third? Don’t let him on the field. Ground. And. Pound. Greg’s eagle eye, via Twitter: More proof that #Jets LB Bart Scott would talk trash to his own relatives. He was captured jawing with #Colts P Pat McAfee on TV. The good news is Smith is back after missing most of the first half with a leg injury. The bad news is he announced his presence by getting caught at the 13 on the kickoff return. Jets have a long way to go. A 47-yard field goal by Adam Vinatieri, set up by David Harris’s stuff of Dominick Rhodes on third-and-1. With less than five minutes left in the third quarter, is that 3 points allowed, or 4 saved? The Jets had a  slight edge in total yards at the half, 153-147, and they increased the edge by  63 yards with their 10-play drive, almost all of it by Shonn Greene (5  rushes 28 yards) and Tomlinson (3 rushes for 15 yards). LaDainian Tomlinson, running like it’s 2004 all night, powers in from the 1 to tie the score. Sanchez, given about an hour and a half to throw, tried to force another high ball to Keller, but this one goes high and right into the hands of cornerback Justin Tryon at the goal line. Brutal throw and brutal decision in that spot. Tryon runs it out to the 23 with 45 seconds left in the half, and a run and a sack kill the quarter. Halftime: Colts 7, Jets unhappy. Bretherton writes: Another tough sequence for the Jets, who moved the ball 61 yards on nine plays after the Colts took the lead. Sanchez was sharp, completing 3 of 4 passes for 35 yards, until missing Keller three times. The Jets have to hope that leaving at least 3 points on the field won’t have repercussions in the second half. On first down at the 19, Sanchez has Keller behind the defense to his right but misses him. Keller calls for a penalty, but he never would have got to that ball. Sanchez goes back to him on second down. Another incompletion. More whining for a call. From Greg Bishop: “That  57-yard TD from Manning to Garcon was slightly reminiscent of the  Collie seam route that broke AFC title game wide open. Same EZ even.” Judy noticed the same thing: “And, Peyton Manning has arrived. Around the same time as they figured it all out in the AFC Championship game last year.” Bretherton writes:  “Obviously a  costly sequence for the Jets, especially after they almost had the Colts pinned  at the 1 on Steve Weatherford’s punt. The Colts, despite struggling to  run effectively in the first quarter, got some traction with three straight running  plays that got them a first down before Manning delivered the pass to Garcon.  I think its safe to say the Jets knew they were not going to keep the Colts off  the scoreboard.” Pierre Garcon just ran right past Cromartie and Pool, who had been sharp early, took a bad line and couldn’t get there in time. That’s a 57-touchdown, and a 7-0 Colts lead. A rope to Braylon Edwards across the middle — a 24-yard gain almost to midfield. But must he flip the ball after every catch? Some first-quarter stats: First downs: Jets 2, Colts 1 Points: 0 Bretherton writes: Quick analysis of first quarter says Sanchez is still trying to find his rhythm. He completed a good throw to Jerricho Cotchery on a third-and-9 play, but also missed badly on a third-and-8 to Holmes later on the same possession. Pressure by the Colts has been a factor.
It might be of interest to note that last year’s A.F.C. title game was also scoreless after one quarter, before the Jets took a 17-13 halftime lead. Bretherton writes: Another three-and-out series by the Jets defense, made even more impressive by the fact the  Jets were penalized 5 yards for having 12 men on the field on second down. Another  stop on third-and-1 even though Manning had time to change the play call at the  line and drop back into the shotgun.
Just wondering … doesn’t it sometimes seem  like the Colts have an extra 10 seconds on their play  clock? Brad Smith almost got to that Colts punt, but in the process he may have injured a groin muscle. He came up grabbing, well, there, and NBC just showed him limping on the sideline. He’s a small but important piece of a lot of things, so keep your eye out for his return. Update from Judy: Brad Smith injured groin, questionable to return. Brodney Pool very active on the first two series: big hit on Pierre Garcon on the Colts’  first play from scrimmage, then two nice reads on third-and-1  plays. The Jets force their second straight three-and-out, but this time it’s Jerricho Cotchery back for the punt. Trying to one-up Holmes, he lets the ball hit, catches it with the back of his neck, then juggles it like a soccer player. Kidding. He makes a fair catch. The ruling on the field is confirmed — no touch by Holmes. But it costs the Colts a challenge. George Bretherton writes: Have to wonder what Caldwell is thinking here give lack of evidence of Holmes  touching the ball. If Rex Ryan made this challenge and lost, he would be  skewered for a bad challenge. The Jets force two incompletions and a punt, but Santonio Holmes nearly gives the ball back. He let the punt drop, but instead of getting away while it was rolling he let it roll toward him — and then through his legs?!?!?!?!!? The Colts thought he touched it and picked it up (the referees ruled he had not) but my goodness — you don’t have to return kicks in the N.F.L. to know that you really ought to get away from a rolling football if you’re Holmes there. Only bad things can happen. The Colts get the ball first, at their 20, and promptly pick up 9 yards on a pass to Pierre Garcon. From Judy Battista: Wow. From Greg: To be clear, he is inactive Saturday against #Colts. This is different than inactive for 3 seasons. Greg Bishop reports a pregame surprise for the Jets: Those waiting for the  first career sack from the âpass rush specialistâ Vernon Gholston will have to  wait until next year, or next week, at the earliest. Gholston is inactive for  this rematch of last yearâs A.F.C. championship game against the Colts. So is  running back Joe McKnight, who turned in his most productive game this season  last Sunday against Buffalo. Beyond that, the Jets’ active list is more intriguing. Right tackle Damien  Woody is active and will return from injury against the Colts. So will safety  Eric Smith. Smith in particular could boost a struggling Jets secondary that has  been hampered by injuries (Darrelle Revis, Jim Leonhard, etc.) all  season.
