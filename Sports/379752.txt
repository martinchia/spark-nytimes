The outstanding matchups this weekend in European soccer. SATURDAY  AtlÃ©tico vs. Real Madrid In theory, AtlÃ©tico has three huge advantages in the Madrid derby. It is at home in the cauldron of Vicente CalderÃ³n stadium. It rested while Real overcame its nemesis, Lyon, in the Champions League three days ago. And AtlÃ©tico has a full squad of fit players, while Realâs injuries start with Cristiano Ronaldo. Real, however, has not lost to its gifted but erratic neighbor since 1999. Its incentive is to cut back the five-point lead of Barcelona, and its once shot-shy Frenchman, Karim Benzema, is hot with nine goals in six games. ââAnything can happen,ââ said AtlÃ©ticoâs  Diego ForlÃ¡n. ââWe cannot afford mistakes in defense, we must be very precise in attack, but we have  the team to play a complete match.ââ

Manchester United vs. Bolton This could, believe it or not, be a rehearsal for the F.A. Cup final in May. More immediately, it will test Unitedâs depleted defense. Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, John OâShea and Rafael da Silva are all casualties, and Bolton has the combative Kevin Davies against any aerial vulnerability. It also has swiftness on the ground with Daniel Sturridge. Typical of Boltonâs indebted status, Sturridge is on loan from Chelsea; and typical of the Premier League, Sturridge is a promising young English talent wasted in reserve while Chelsea spends 100 million pounds on foreign strikers. Even at Bolton, he is challenged by a Swede, Johan Elmander, a Croat, Ivan Klasnic, and a Bulgarian, Martin Petrov. Palermo vs. A.C. Milan Everything in Milanâs season now depends on its winning the Scudetto, the league title. Palermo has disintegrated since beating Juventus in Sicily at the beginning of February and has scored in only one of its five straight defeats in Serie A. Yet it has Javier Pastore, one of the brightest young No. 10âs in the  league. Palermoâs president, Maurizio  Zamprini, claims he is considering a big money offer for the 21-year-old Argentine â but also says he might quit if his teamâs dire run continues. It must if Milan is to stay clear of Inter and Napoli at the top. SUNDAY Bayer Leverkusen vs. Schalke The coaching carousel goes around and around the Bundesliga. It seems nobody is safe, except the coach of league-leading Borussia Dortmund. After Schalke dismissed Felix Magath during the week, Leverkusen, the only team remotely capable of catching Dortmund, will apparently make an announcement over its coach, Jupp Heynckes, after this weekend. Because the 65-year-old Heynckes gets along with Bayern Munich president, Uli Hoeness, some are guessing that Heynckes could be on his way to a third term. The speculation in March is all very unlike the Bundesliga, where stability is usually the order. Schalkeâs RaÃºl must wonder in that respect if he ever really left Real Madrid. Marseille vs. Paris-St. Germain Cancel all police leave. This at Stade VÃ©lodrome is sure to put pressure on security. Marseille vs. Paris is often a strain on law and order, and this time tensions are heightened. Marseille, eliminated from the Champions League, is fourth in the French  league, four points behind Lille. St. Germain is fifth, one win behind Marseille. Between  them and Lille lie Lyon and Stade Rennes, who play each other Saturday. This is the tightest French title race in recent memory. Celtic vs. Rangers Glasgowâs giants meet too often, and fight too aggressively, for comfort. This time it is the final of the Scottish Cup. Celtic Coach Neil Lennon and Rangers assistant coach Ally McCoist are banned from the sideline after going head to head, literally, two weeks ago. ââThe unedifying sight of two of the countryâs most respected coaches engaged in angry confrontation,ââ said the Scottish F.A. chief executive, ââwas not only unsavory but exacerbated an already incendiary atmosphere inside the stadium and throughout the West of Scotland.ââ  Everyone from Parliament members to the police have debated teh issues â including religious bigotry, playersâ lack of discipline, even threats to hold future Celtic-Ranger matches with no audience allowed.
