John Wallace and Pearl Washington, the former Syracuse basketball stars, are on opposite sides regarding their alma materâs decision to leave the Big East for the Atlantic Coast Conference in the midst of major realignment. Pittsburgh and Syracuse, a member of the Big East since it was founded in 1979, will move to the A.C.C. in June 2014. âI was not happy when I heard about it,â said Wallace, who led the Orange to the 1996 N.C.A.A. championship game, which they lost to Kentucky. âThe Big East is one of the best basketball conferences, if not the best conference in the country, so if thereâs going to be a realignment, teams should be joining it, not leaving it,â said Wallace, whose N.B.A. career included two stints with the Knicks. âI just canât imagine Syracuse not having teams like UConn, Georgetown, St. Johnâs and Villanova on their schedule. Iâve gotten over a hundred text messages from friends who are true Syracuse people, and theyâre not happy about this either.â  Washington, whose Big East battles at Madison Square Garden against Georgetownâs Patrick Ewing and St. Johnâs Chris Mullin and Walter Berry in the mid-1980s became the stuff of college basketball legend in New York, said, âIâm all for Syracuse going to the A.C.C.”

âYeah, itâs a bit of a shock that Syracuse is leaving the Big East,” Washington added. “But itâs all about money, and all about joining the conferences with the big football programs that generate large revenues. So if Syracuse wants to put itself in a position to make more money, you should be all for it.â Wallace, who grew up in Rochester and whose N.B.A. career included two stints with the Knicks, said that family and friends of players from the Northeast would also be affected by Syracuse’s move. âMy mom could get to most Big East venues to watch me play,â Wallace said. âBut I know she wouldnât have been able to afford to go away on weekends and watch me play against teams like North Carolina, Duke or Florida State. I think other players and their families will now have that problem, and I feel bad for them.â  Washington, who grew up in Brooklyn and went on to play for the Nets, maintained that Syracuse would have âa much wider recruiting base once it goes to the A.C.C.â âAnd having teams like Duke and North Carolina playing at the Carrier Dome will be a lot of fun,â he added.  Wallace and Washington, guests at an anniversary party for the âBoomer and Cartonâ program on WFAN-AM and MSG Network on Wednesday in Manhattan, agreed that the Big East would suffer immensely if Connecticut, a perennial basketball power and the defending N.C.A.A. champion, also decided to leave.  âOh, man, I donât even want to think about that,â Washington said. âIt wouldnât be a very pretty picture.â  Wallace said he âcouldnât imagine a team like UConn switching conferences after winning a title.â Washington reminded him that âin college sports these days, money is much more important than prestige.â
