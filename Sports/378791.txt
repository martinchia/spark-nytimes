Christina McHaleâs hardcourt season has included an upset of the womenâs world No. 1, Caroline Wozniacki. But without a victory Monday night in her opening match at the United States Open, all the good vibrations of the summer would have evaporated in the night air.  McHale was all smiles after eking out a momentum-building 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-4 victory over the Canadian Aleksandra Wozniak on the new Court 17.
 âIâm so excited,â she said, âespecially like the close ones sometimes feel better than winning easily, like pulling it out like that.â  A defeat, she said, âwould have been definitely disappointing because this is a tournament that I really want to do well at.â   In the deciding set, McHale quickly fell behind, two games to none. âIt just felt out of my control,â she said. âSo, yeah, I knew that the next game, the 2-love game, was crucial if I was going to come back.â   McHale, 19, from Englewood Cliffs, N.J., turned the decisive set around with a little help from her relatives, who were scattered around the court and made their presence known.   âIt was nice,â said McHale, who made 39 unforced errors, including eight in the third set. âWhatever side of the court I was on, I always had someone that was cheering.â  McHale, the youngest player in the top 100, has climbed to 55. She is appearing in the main draw for the first time after receiving wild card the previous two years.  Asked the impetus behind her progress, she said, âJust working hard each day on the court and trying my best out there every time.â Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
