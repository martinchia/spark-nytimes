 Switzerland kept Lionel Messi down for a valiant 118 minutes. With two, three, even four defenders on him whenever he had the ball, Messi failed to link up with teammates, failed to take over the game as he had in the group stage, and failed to get his team on the scoreboard. With the score still knotted at 0-0 and only two minutes of extra time left, penalty kicks seemed inevitable.   Then Messi roared to life. The Swiss defender Stephan Lichtsteiner lost the ball near midfield, and Messi, for once, found himself with space to run at the defense. He drove forward past two players to the edge of the box before feeding his chief accomplice, Angel Di Maria, on the right side. Di Maria coolly slotted the ball home into the far corner with his left foot, giving Argentina the lead at the latest possible moment. They held out during a nervy few minutes (in which Switzerland hit the post) to move on to the quarterfinal.   Considered favorites to go on to the final, Argentina hardly impressed against a well-organized Swiss team. For most of the game, Switzerland defended comfortably, while Argentina possessed the ball but seemed short of ideas, unable to create many chances. Xherdan Shaqiri, meanwhile, created several good chances for the Swiss when they did win the ball. Several misses from Swiss strikers in the first half will haunt them.  Still, Argentinaâs boundless attacking talent once again carried them through. After being stifled for most of the game, Messi delivered at the most critical moment, while Di Maria finally offered Messi some help.   If Argentina had lost this game on penalties, Messiâs legacy would have been severely tarnished. Instead, he has only enhanced his legend, and he has a chance to keep going. His country expects nothing less than the title.   Argentina will next play either the United States or Belgium. Oh, you have heard a little about that game? Stay with usâthe teams take the field in just over an hour, and weâll be bringing you live coverage. Full story Â» Shaqiri has been a menace every time he has gotten on the ball, and he has now carved out the first clear chance of the match.  Switzerland play a quick corner to Shaqiri, who carries the ball into the box and find  Xhaka open at the penalty spot. Xhaka keeps his shot down, but hits it right at the Argentine keeper, Romero, who also saves a follow-up effort from further out.  A moment later, Lavezzi has a chance down the other end, which Benaglio saves for Switzerland. The game is opening up.
   Stunningly important stop by Romero there. Looked like he saw shot late. â Andrew Das (@AndrewDasNYT) July 1, 2014  Somehow, after all that, it looks like Messi and Di Maria have saved Argentina after all.  Argentina win the ball from Lichtsteiner in midfield, and quickly find Messi. For once, he has space to run at the defense. He carries the ball into the box, then feeds Di Maria on the right, who dispatches a clinical finish to the far corner. 1-0. Looks like the jobs is done.
   With three minutes of added time for Switzerland to try to snatch an equalizer, Switzerland presses forward and fashions a golden chance. Great ball in from Shaqiri on the right finds the head of Dzemaili. All alone, he had to score, but he hits the post. That could be the last chance for the Swiss to avoid heartbreak.  That. Is. Amazing. How did he miss? — Sam Borden (@SamBorden) July 1, 2014  Lionel Messi is silencing those doubters who said that last season showed he is past his best. He has carried Argentina with four goals. The Swiss gave up just six goals in 10 qualifying matches; they have given up six in just three games at the Cup. More Messi goals to come?  A quarterfinal spot against either Belgium or the United States  Advertisement
