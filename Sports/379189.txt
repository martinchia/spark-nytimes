Advertisement  JIM DOEHRING, a shot-putter who made the United States Olympic team on his final attempt at the national trials, could be in danger of losing his berth because of a recent drug conviction, The San Diego Union-Tribune said yesterday. Federal court records show that Doehring pleaded guilty Dec. 16 to conspiring to possess methamphetamine with intent to distribute. Doehring, 30 years old, qualified last week for his second trip to the Olympics with a toss of 69 feet, 2 inches on his final attempt, which moved him from fourth place to second. Officials with the United States Olympic Committee and The Athletics Congress, the national governing body of track and field, say Doehring's status for the Summer Games might be subject to review.
