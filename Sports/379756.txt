PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. â Ronny Paulino finally arrived in Mets camp on Saturday after securing his long-awaited visa. Paulino said he had been working out every day in the Dominican Republic and declared himself ready to play. Paulino, who is expected to back up catcher Josh Thole, has a .273 batting average over six seasons. He was Pittsburgh’s everyday catcher for two seasons, then split time behind the plate with Florida for two seasons before signing with the Mets as a free agent. Teams like to have their catchers work with their pitchers as much as possible before the season to get themselves acquainted with the pitchersâ stuff. Paulino will be behind the curve in that regard, although he said he would not need much time. But donât expect him to catch the knuckleball pitcher R. A. Dickey very often. Paulino, 29, said he had never caught a knuckleballer. Complicating the familiarity issue is the fact that Paulino will miss the first eight games of the regular season to complete a 50-game suspension for testing positive for a banned substance last year.  âYou make a mistake, you learn from it,â he said. âFrom now on, I need to be careful with everything.â The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
