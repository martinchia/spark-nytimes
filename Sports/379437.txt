The UEFA Champions League on Wednesday brings the second series of matches in the form of six group-stage games, with Manchester City hosting Napoli and Bayern Munich traveling to Villarreal in Spain in Group A, which has been nominated as the tournament’s group of death. The schedule (all games start at 2:45 p.m. Eastern): Group A
Napoli at Manchester City
Bayern Munich at Villarreal Group B
Trabzonspor at Internazionale
CSKA Moscow at Lille Group C
Otelul Galati at Basel
Manchester United at Benfica Group D
Real Madrid at Dinamo Zagreb
Lyon at Ajax (TV: Benfica-Manchester United is Fox Soccer’s live game; Zagreb-Madrid is on Fox Sports Net; in New York, that means MSG Plus; Napoli-Manchester City is live on Fox Soccer Plus.) A few notes about Wednesday’s games:  Â¶ Color this game blue, as in sky blue, the preferred color of both Manchester City and Napoli. City is everyone’s flavor of the month. To say that City has been busy in the transfer period would be a soaring understatement as Manager Roberto Mancini has again remade the squad in a bid to 1) challenge crosstown rival Manchester United in the English Premier League, and 2) put in a good showing in the Champions League. The transfer list is long: midfielder Owen Hargreaves on a free transfer from Manchester United; the French midfielder Samir Nasri from Arsenal; the Romanian goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon on loan from Timisoara; the Argentine forward Sergio AgÃ¼ero from AtlÃ©tico Madrid; the Montenegrin defender Stefan Savic from Partizan; and the French defender GaÃ«l Clichy from Arsenal. The club’s owner, Sheik Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a member of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family, is hell-bent on duplicating the spending of Chelsea’s Roman Abramovich, but with better results, if that is possible. Drawn in to Group A, perhaps the toughest of the group stage, Mancini told The Guardian: I agree it is a tough group, and anything can happen, but Bayern are used to playing in the Champions League every year. I don’t know why there is so much fuss about Manchester City spending all the money, though. It is not as though we are the only ones. I think six or seven teams around Europe spent more than us in summer, yet we are the only ones being talked about. And it is not unknown for new teams to do well in the Champions League. When I played in the competition for the first time with Sampdoria we went all the way to the final. And several teams from England, such as Nottingham Forest, have won it at the first attempt. Napoli (which was declared bankrupt in 2004 and relegated to the third division), like City, is back in the continental competition after a surprising third-place finish in Serie A last season, the club’s best showing since 1990, when a guy named Diego Maradona was in residence. And, as the world knows, City’s AgÃ¼ero is Maradona’s son-in-law. Napoli’s key acquisitions this season were the Macedonia striker Goran Pandev, 28, on loan from Internazionale, and the Italy midfielder Marco Donadel, 28, on a free transfer from Fiorentina. In the other group match, Bayern Munich, which has collected 12 of a possible 15 points to lead the Bundesliga with a gaudy 16-1 goal differential, travels to Spain for a tricky match against Villarreal. Munich’s Mario Gomez already has eight goals in league play; the Yellow Submarine is off to a slow start after opening the Liga season with a 5-0 pounding at the hands of Barcelona and a dowdy 2-2 draw at home against Sevilla. Both teams navigated a playoff to advance to the group stage.  Â¶ Trabzonspor, runner-up in the Super League last season, landed in the group stage after the Turkish federation penalized Fenerbahce for its part in a match-fixing scandal. Inter and Trab faced each other in the 1983-84 UEFA Cup when the Turkish club’s current manager, Senol Gunes, was the goalkeeper. Inter is reeling after its opening match in Serie A, where the season was delayed for one week because of a players’ strike. The Nerazzurri went to Palmero, blew a 1-0 halftime lead and lost, 4-3. It was the first time Inter had allowed four goals in a league match in more than seven years. âIt certainly wasnât the start we wanted, but weâve just got to stay calm now and believe in the work weâve put in,â the Inter captain, Javier Zanetti, told The Associated Press. âWeâve got full faith in Gasperini and weâre hoping to apply his ideas in a hurry.â Lille, the defending champion in Ligue 1, added Vincent Enyeama, BenoÃ®t Pedretti and David Rozehnal to an already strong squad. CSKA reached the quarterfinals in 2009-10 after having won the UEFA Cup in 2004-5.  Â¶ Each team in Group C will play six games, leading to the inevitable outcome: Manchester United will win the group, perhaps with a perfect 18 points (can anyone see it dropping more than a point or 2?), and move on to the first knockout stage early next year. If anyone doubts that, a friendly wager would be in order. After a scary-good start to the Premier League season (4 wins, 18 goals for, 3 goals against), the Red Devils should be challenged, for a while, against Benfica in Portugal. But it is hard to see how Basel or Otelul Galati will be any threat. The real race here is to see who finishes second. Â¶ Real Madrid is a perfect 2 for 2 in La Liga, with another outlandish goal differential. But for its journey to Croatia, Madrid will be without the Brazilian KakÃ¡ and the club’s cantankerous Portuguese manager, JosÃ© Mourinho. KakÃ¡ has a heel injury and Mourinho has been brought to heel by UEFA as he serves the second of a three-game ban for his actions during last season’s Champions league series against Barcelona. Zagreb Coach Krunoslav Jurcic has taken his club through three qualifying rounds and into the group stage.  He had this to say about his opposite number on UEFA.com: During the last few years I have analyzed [Mourinho’s] work as a coach a lot, and I can say he is my idol. I don’t want to hide that. I like his way of managing matches a lot, and his reactions during matches, he brings a lot of emotion into matches. If there are no emotions, football is not a real sport for me. Without people like JosÃ©, football would never be as popular as it is at the moment. The other match in Group D brings together Ajax, the Dutch club that still clings to its past glory, now nearly 30 years in the past, and Lyon, the French club that has been consistently strong in Ligue 1 over the past decade, but has failed to claim much success in the continental competition. Through five matches in their domestic competitions, Ajax is in first place in the Eredivise and Lyon is a point back of Montpellier.
