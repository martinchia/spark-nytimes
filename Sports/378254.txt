Advertisement  Unless a major trade opportunity arises, the Atlanta Falcons have decided to make Jeff George, the quarterback at the University of Illinois, the No. 1 pick in the National Football League college draft on April 22. George will give up his senior year to turn professional. ''We've seen him,'' said Ken Herock, the Falcons' vice president for player personnel. ''We like him. We think he's the best choice. Unless someone comes up with a block- buster offer, he's the pick. Our goal now is to try to sign him to a contract.'' Since they hold the draft's No. 1 pick, the Falcons can begin talks with a player before the draft begins. Keith McCants, the Alabama linebacker who was once considered to be the Falcons' No. 1 preference, has a knee problem that is causing N.F.L. clubs some concern, according to a report in The Atlanta Constitution yesterday.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
