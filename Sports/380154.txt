Advertisement  AL BAGNOLI became the 21st head coach in Penn's 115-year football history yesterday and promised to return the program to the excellence of the 1980's, when the Quakers won or shared six Ivy League titles. Bagnoli, 38, has been the head coach of Division III Union College for the past 10 years. He succeeds Gary Steele, who resigned in November after a 2-8 season in his third year. Bagnoli's record at Union was 86-19. He guided the Schnectady, N.Y., college to the N.C.A.A. playoffs seven times, twice losing in the finals.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
