Advertisement  BASKETBALL North Carolina Rallies George Lynch scored 20 of his 24 points in the second half last night, helping ninth-ranked North Carolina erase a 13-point deficit and take a 98-87 victory over Jacksonville. Lynch, a 6-foot-7-inch junior, did not start because of his poor play against Florida State on Sunday, but enjoyed a perfect shooting half last night, hitting eight goals and four free throws without a miss. He scored 8 of his points during an 18-0 run that gave North Carolina a 68-61 lead while Jacksonville, playing at home, went 6 minutes 11 seconds without a point. Eric Montross added 21 points and 12 rebounds and Hubert Davis added 20 points as the Tar Heels (7-1) bounced back from Sunday's Atlantic Coast Conference home loss to Florida State. James Fuller, a reserve, scored 28 points for Jacksonville (1-7), hitting 10 of 15 shots, including 6 of 10 from 3-point range. Kelly McKinnon added 21 points. (AP) Michigan St. 75, Ill.-Chicago 51: Dwayne Stephens scored a career-high 19 points and Anthony Miller and Mike Peplowski scored 14 each as Michigan State, playing at home in East Lansing, routed Illinois-Chicago. The Spartans (7-0), after leading by only 32-31 at halftime, pulled away in the second half in large part because of miserable shooting by Illinois-Chicago (2-5). The Flames, who shot just 35 percent in the first half, made only 3 of 29 shots in the first 15 minutes of the second half. (AP) SKIING Jagge Edges Tomba Finn Christian Jagge of Norway, competing on the home course of Alberto Tomba, edged the Italian star by 9-hundredths of a second in the men's slalom yesterday at Madonna di Campiglio, Italy, for his first World Cup victory. The 25-year-old Jagge, who considered retiring in 1989 after tearing ligaments in his right knee, finished fifth and fourth in the season's two opening slaloms in the United States last month. He finished second to Tomba at Sestriere, Italy, last week. Jagge had the fastest first heat of 43.03 seconds down the steep Miramonti track, finishing 31-hundredths of a second ahead of Tomba. Tomba turned in the fastest second heat at 45.16, but it was not enough to overtake Jagge, who finished third in the heat at 45.38. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
