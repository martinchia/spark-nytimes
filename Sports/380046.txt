On a clear, warm day in which almost no wind blew off the Pacific Ocean, both played at Pebble Beach, one of three courses being used for this tournament. "If you were going to get Pebble, today was the day you could really do it," said Sluman, the 1988 PGA Champion. "But how can you ever get upset playing this golf course? It's kind of what golf is all about." Wiebe's Favorite Course Wiebe, who went to college at San Jose State, said Pebble Beach has been his favorite course since he first played it at the age of 16.

In December, he failed to regain his playing card at the tour's qualifying school.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

"I just played so bad last year," said Wiebe, who explained his slump started when he got confused after trying to change his swing. "I just felt no matter how tough I was mentally, I just didn't have the skill to compete. There was a ceiling on my game." But Wiebe thinks he has turned the situation around with hard work over the last several weeks. A key figure has been his longtime teacher Carl Welty, Wiebe said Welty had helped him regain a natural feeling swing. "I feel like my body is working normally instead of having to make it do something," he said.
