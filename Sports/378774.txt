Melanie Oudin and Jack Sock vs. Elena Vesnina and Leander Paes
Arthur Ashe Stadium, second match after 7 p.m. Tuesdayâs U.S. Open junior championships are heavy on doubles, but the most interesting teenage pair on court will be competing in Arthur Ashe Stadium, as a featured night match. The wild card mixed doubles team of 18-year-old Jack Sock and 19-year-old Melanie Oudin have taken out one veteran team after another, including top seeds and defending champions Bob Bryan and Leizel Huber, on their way to the semifinals. Sock and Oudin have drawn big crowds and enthusiastic support during their surprising run, but the cavernous Ashe is not likely to provide the atmosphere they enjoyed on Court 17 or Court 11. Sock and Oudin will need to get by yet another pair of veterans, No. 7 seeds Elena Vesnina of Russia and Leander Paes of India. Paes, at 38, is a year older than the combined ages of Sock and Oudin, and he has six grand slam mixed doubles titles, so the teens will again be underdogs, but if the crowd stays around to support them, they have a chance to pull off yet another upset. Hayley Carter vs. Aliaksandra Sasnovich
Court 13, second match after 11 a.m. Carter, a 16-year-old from South Carolina, posted a major upset in her junior grand slam debut on Sunday, beating the No. 7 seed Montserrat Gonzalez 7-5 in the third. Her most impressive shot is her first serve, which is one of the biggest in girls junior tennis, but despite being nearly six feet tall, she also plays excellent defense.  Carter trains at the Smith-Stearns Academy in Hilton Head, S.C., and former U.S. Open champion Stan Smith will be watching the progress of his pupil against the 17-year-old from Belarus. Jessica Pegula v. Su Jeong Jang
Court 4 11 a.m. Pegula, whose father owns the N.H.L.âs Buffalo Sabres, received entry and her No. 14 seeding based on her W.T.A. ranking, and the US Open is her first junior tournament this year.  A power baseliner, the 17-year-old Boca Raton resident is now training with Maria Sharapovaâs former coach Michael Joyce. She was impressive in her opening round match Sunday, and is a heavy favorite over the qualifier from Korea. Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
