 Hoping to avoid a surgical procedure that could sideline him for two months, Yankees right fielder Carlos Beltran began taking cortisone orally on Thursday to augment the cortisone injection he received in his right elbow Monday. Beltran got a diagnosis of bone spurs in the elbow, and the Yankees placed him on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to Tuesday. The hope is that two weeks of rest and the cortisone will allow him to heal. “If in 15 days it doesn’t get better, we have to make another decision,” Beltran said. Beltran said doctors told him he would probably be out six to eight weeks if surgery was needed. In Beltran’s absence, Ichiro Suzuki, 40, could play a lot more, but he has been out for the last few days with a sore lower back. In December, Beltran agreed to a three-year, $45 million contract on the day Robinson Cano agreed to sign with Seattle. Beltran has played 33 games for the Yankees, with a .234 batting average, five home runs and 15 runs batted in. Beltran, 37, first felt pain in his elbow Monday night while taking swings in the batting cage before a game against the Mets at Yankee Stadium. He said that some of the swelling and discomfort had subsided but that he still could not swing a bat because of the pain.
