NATHAN SCHEELHAASE The Illinois quarterback passed for a career-high 391 yards, then scored on a 1-yard run with 13 seconds left to lead the No. 24 Illini to a 38-35 win over Northwestern. A. J. Jenkins caught 12 balls for a team-record 268 yards and 3 touchdowns. DUSTIN GARRISON The West Virginia freshman, right, rushed for 291 yards and 2 touchdowns as the Mountaineers routed Bowling Green, 55-10. His total nearly matched the West Virginia ground gameâs output in its first four games combined (306 yards). TYRANN MATHIEU The L.S.U. cornerback forced two fumbles, returning one 23 yards for a score, in the Tigersâ 35-7 win over Kentucky. The strips gave Mathieu, a sophomore, three for the season â he has returned two for scores â and nine in his career, a team record.  MATT BARKLEY AND ROBERT WOODS Barkley, U.S.C.âs quarterback, broke Carson Palmerâs team record with 468 yards passing, and Woods made 14 catches for 255 yards and 2 scores in a 48-41 win over Arizona. Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III finally made a mistake, and it cost the Bears dearly in a 36-35 loss at Kansas State. Griffin, who came into the game having thrown more touchdown passes than incompletions this season, threw his first interception of the season midway through the fourth quarter, and the Wildcats drove for the winning field goal. The Bears still had time after the kick, especially given their quick-strike ability. But Griffin was sacked on first down moments later, and after two plays covered only 11 yards, Griffinâs fourth-down pass fell incomplete. The ending spoiled another virtuoso performance for Griffin, who finished 23 of 31 for 346 yards and 5 scores. He has thrown 18 touchdown passes, but now 20 incompletions, in four games. Baseballâs regular season ended with a wild day of comebacks, and on Saturday, college football had a few of its own. Texas Tech, Navy, Illinois and Arkansas rallied from deficits of at least 18 points, though the Midshipmen were the only one of the four who were unable to turn their comeback into a win. Texas Tech had the biggest comeback, rallying from 20 points behind to beat Kansas, 45-34. Navy rallied from 18 points down in the fourth quarter to force overtime against Air Force, but lost, 35-34, when a long conversion attempt was blocked after an unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty was called on Kriss Proctor when the officials said he âgot in the faceâ of an Air Force player after his touchdown run. âIt was a huge penalty; it changed everything,â Navyâs furious coach, Ken Niumatalolo, said. âI hope those guys can sleep well tonight.â SECOND CHANCE L.S.U. quarterback Jordan Jefferson heard plenty of boos from the home fans in his return from a suspension that stemmed from a bar fight, but quickly won over some of them when he stretched across the goal line for a touchdown on his first play in the top-ranked Tigersâ 35-7 victory over visiting Kentucky. Jefferson was reinstated this week after a grand jury reduced the charges he faces in connection with an Aug. 19 bar fight to a misdemeanor. TROPHY GAMES Michigan beat Minnesota to retain possession of the Little Brown Jug, Southern Methodist edged Texas Christian in the Battle for the Iron Skillet, Cincinnati topped Miami (Ohio) to win the Victory Bell, and Illinois edged Northwestern to win the Land of
Lincoln trophy â a replica of Abe Lincolnâs hat that the teams have played for since 2009.
