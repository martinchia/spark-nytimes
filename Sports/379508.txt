Advertisement  South Africa took its first medals in these Olympics today when the doubles team of Wayne Ferreira and Piet Norval won a silver medal in tennis and a distance runner, Elana Meyer, took a silver medal in the women's 10,000-meter run. South Africa's last Olympic medals, a silver and two bronze, came at the 1960 Rome Olympics. The country was banned from the Olympic movement by the International Olympic Committee for its apartheid policy. The I.O.C. reinstated South Africa this year. Ferreira and Norval lost to Boris Becker and Michael Stich of Germany in the men's doubles final. Meyer, South Africa's most prominent distance runner, led the women's 10,000 until being passed by Derartu Tulu of Ethiopia. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
