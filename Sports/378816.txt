With 11 out of 16 A.F.C. teams tied for first place in their divisions or no more than a game out, the answer seems to be no. Only a game and a half separates all 11 teams in the conference standings.Â Imagine a Kentucky Derby in which almost three quarters of the field is stretched out across the track in the backstretch trying to edge into the lead. In football terms, think of it this way: Pittsburgh, at 6-2, sits atop the A.F.C. standings, but if the Steelers were to blink and lose to Baltimore on Sunday, they could go from being at the top of the conference to being in third place in the North Division. Probably the best way to sum up the A.F.C.âs unpredictability would be to look at the turnaround taking place in Kansas City.Â Left for dead after losing their first three games by a combined 109-27, they are the first team in the N.F.L. to start 0-3 and wind up tied for first in their division four games later. And the Chiefsâ surge may not be over. They have games against 0-7 Miami and 2-5 Denver in the next two weeks. After a game at New England on Nov. 21, they have a chance to be â amazingly — in first place in the conference. That the Chiefs are even in this conversation going into Week 9 is bizarre enough. But all 11Â A.F.C. teams that are either in first place or within a game of it will be playing on Sunday, and each team has the chance to end up in first place in its division by Monday. Here is the rundown: Pittsburgh (6-2)Â As explained above, the Steelers could find themselves alone at the top of the A.F.C. or in third place in the North.
New England (5-2) Would be in no worse than a tie for first in the East with a victory over the Giants. The Patriots would move into a tie for first in the A.F.C. with a victory and a Pittsburgh loss.
Buffalo (5-2) Would be in no worse than a tie for first in the East with a victory over the Jets. The Bills would move into a tie for first in the A.F.C. with a victory and a Pittsburgh loss.
Baltimore (5-2) Would move into no worse than a tie for first in the A.F.C. with a victory over Pittsburgh.
Cincinnati (5-2) Would move into a tie for first in the A.F.C. with a victory over Tennessee and a Pittsburgh loss.
Houston (5-3) Would remain in first in the SouthÂ with a victory over Cleveland.
Jets (4-3) Would move into a tie for first in the East with a victory over the Bills and a Patriots loss.
Tennessee (4-3) Would move into first in the SouthÂ with a victory over Cincinnati and a Houston loss.
Kansas City, San Diego and Oakland (4-3) Are tied for first in the West Division and will either stay in first or fall out of it based on the results of their games. Kansas City hosts Miami, San Diego hosts Green Bay and Oakland hosts Denver.
