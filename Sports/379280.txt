Parnell, who learned last week that he had a partly torn ulnar collateral ligament, is expected to miss the rest of this season, and his availability for the start of the 2015 season could be in jeopardy. Parnell had surgery last September to repair a herniated disk in his neck. He was working his way back in the months since, until he felt some discomfort in his forearm late in spring training.  Parnell had been starting to establish himself as a reliable closer. After posting a 2.49 earned run average in 2011, he had a 2.16 E.R.A. and 22 saves in 2012.Â But after blowing a save on opening day, Parnell was examined and the torn ligament was found. He tried to avoid surgery, receiving platelet-rich plasma therapy and resting the arm. Apparently, the tear was serious enough for Parnell and the Mets to elect for surgery.  Parnell will become the third Mets pitcher, joining starters Jeremy Hefner and Matt Harvey, to have Tommy John surgery since last summer.  TIM ROHAN    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
