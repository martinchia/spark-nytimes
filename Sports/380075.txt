Advertisement BY JOE SEXTON The numbers are digested daily by both the Yankees and the Mets. To the Yankees, Tony Fernandez's offensive assault for the Blue Jays could be killing their title hopes. When the Mets read the box scores -- Fernandez drove in five runs in a 9-5 victory over the Tigers on Tuesday night -- a fury and disgust of a different sort apparently sets in. Manager Dallas Green, whose angry exasperation with Fernandez was the final impetus to the club's trading the shortstop in June, openly accuses Fernandez of having intentionally played less than 100 percent for the Mets. The charge is serious and blunt, but Green makes it without much equivocation. "I have no regrets at all about trading the guy," Green said. "I'm more than upset that a guy would do something like he's done. Don't tell me something ain't wrong about what's taken place."

In his first game with the Blue Jays, Fernandez tripled and has been on a consistent tear since. His average after Tuesday night was .296.

The manager also defended his handling of the situation and his pressuring the club to deal Fernandez. "I did everything I could for the man," Green said. "I knew he was hurt, that he was lonely, unhappy. I tried to talk to him every day, to put my arm around him. I did everything. Well, not everything. I didn't get him to play for me." Attempts to reach Fernandez by telephone yesterday were unsuccessful. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
