Advertisement  MATS WILANDER showed up on crutches at a news conference yesterday in Bastad, Sweden, to announce that he would not play in the United States Open. The Swedish tennis player had arthroscopic knee surgery earlier this week. "Unfortunately, it's too early," Wilander said of playing in the tournament he won in 1988. "I don't think the hard courts are good for my knee." Wilander, ranked 56th in the world, was injured at the Queen's Club in England four weeks ago and missed Wimbledon. He is expected to be out two months. The United States Open starts on Aug. 26. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
