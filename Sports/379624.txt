The Green Bay Packers are headed back to the Super Bowl after beating the Chicago Bears, 21-14, in the N.F.C. championship game at Soldier Field. But before their trip to Dallas was sealed, they had to withstand a rally attempt led by perhaps the most unlikely figure in championship game history. Caleb Hanie, the Bears’ third-string quarterback, was forced into action after Jay Cutler and Todd Collins were both knocked out with injuries. Hanie threw a 35-yard touchdown to Earl Bennett with 4:43 remaining that pulled the Bears within 7 points, but his inexperience showed. He threw one interception that was returned B.J. Raji 18 yards for a score and he was picked off by Sam Shields with about 40 seconds left, a play that sealed the Packers’ victory. Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers was 17 of 30 for 244 yards, but he was intercepted twice and the Packers’ last offensive touchdown came on a 4-yard run by James Starks with 11 minutes 13 seconds left in the second quarter. While Packers fans will remember this game as one that put their beloved team back in the Super Bowl, Bears fans will have a much different memory. Cutler was knocked out of the game early in the second half with a knee injury and spent the rest of the game standing on the sideline. 



6:16 p.m. Interception! Game Over!
 Hanie looks deep down the middle for Knox, but Shields nabs his second  interception of the game. The Bears are done. The final: Packers 21,  Bears 14. On the field, pals Rodgers and Cutler embrace. From the Packers’ 34, Hanie is flushed from the pocket and throws out of  bounds. Clock: 1:21 to play. Then Hanie finds Olsen on the left for  seven yards, forced out of bounds with 1:15 left. Time for another  blitz? Chester Taylor punches through the right side, first down. Bears are still breathing, with two timeouts remaining. Two-minute warning. With 1:54 left, Bears face a fourth and 1 at their 49. Sense nervousness in the Land of Cheese? Capers orders up a third-down blitz, but Hanie steps into the pocket and  completes to to Olsen at the Chicago 40 — the first third-down  conversion of the day. Huge fourth-down play coming up after the two-minute warning. Bears force another Packers punt. Hester can’t get much, though, and the Bears start on their 29 with 2:53 to play. Bears kick away. First and 10 for the Packers at their 25. Check that: Hanie engineers a touchdown drive in less than 90 seconds,  hitting Earl Bennett for a touchdown. Packers, 21-14. With 4:43 left, is  it too early for an onside kick? Not enough, apparently. This is a Dom Capers special: Nose tackle B. J.  Raji engages center Olin Kreutz, then slides to his right into pass  coverage. Hanie throws it right to him, and Raji returns it 18 yards for  a touchdown. He does a little showboating, holding the ball in one hand away  from his body the last five yards before getting it knocked out in  the end zone. Packers, 21-7. Rodgers can’t complete a third-down jump pass, and Tim Masthay — who,  like everybody else in the joint, figures Hester is due to break one —  punts the ball out of bounds at the Chicago 11 with 7:22 to play.  There’s plenty of time for the Bears to drive. So what’s Hanie got? Hanie throws out of bounds to avoid a big rush, and the Bears punt  again. With 8:29 to play, the Bears are 0 for 9 on third down. By the way, remember the rule change if this goes to overtime. It’s only  sudden death if the team gaining possession first scores a touchdown on  its first drive. If they kick a field goal, the other team gets the  ball with a chance to tie or win. The crowd is into it now, yelling, twirling towels. Peppers smokes  Rodgers, driving the crown of his helmet into the side of Rodgers’  helmet. Peppers gets flagged for roughing the passer; Rodgers, who  missed a game with a concussion earlier this season, looks as annoyed  about the hit as Peppers was about the call. Because Hanie entered before the fourth quarter, both Cutler and Collins are prohibited from coming back. A miracle: Hanie throws to Johnny Knox, who beats Tramon Williams and  takes it down to the 1, a 32-yard gain. Chester Taylor spins in for  the score. Now it’s interesting. Green Bay, 14-7. Cutler is standing on the sideline, looking bummed. He’s got ear buds  going under a knit cap. He’d better not be listing to a call-in show. Looks like Urlacher and Co. have decided they will have to win this game  themselves, since the offense isn’t doing anything. Suddenly, the  Packers can’t move the ball. Get this: the Bears third-string quarterback Caleb Hanie has a helmet on, looking  mighty frisky. Now he’s in the game. Anybody ever hear of him? If the Packers hold on here — easy, cheeseheads, I’m not trying to jinx  ya — it’s worth noting that they will go to the Super Bowl with 15 players on  injured reserve. Â That’s a testament to their drafting, scouting and  player development. Shields and Tramon Williams, two of their three best cornerbacks along with Charles Woodson, are undrafted free agents. But the  Bears’ defense is getting after Rodgers now, and somebody on the  offensive side needs to make a play. How about a play-action deep ball  to Hester? Urlacher saves the day for the Bears, intercepting Rodgers at the 5 and  bringing it out 40 yards until slipping and falling after getting tripped up by Rodgers. Collins is in for Cutler (knee). The Bears say Cutler  is questionable to return; curiously, none of the Bears trainers are  working on his knee. While Packers are driving, Cutler is on the bench, bundled up and looking annoyed, as the backup quarterback Todd Collins warms up. The stands at Soldier Field appeared to be half-empty when the second half kicked off. Can’t  blame these folks for trying to find some warmth. They haven’t had much  to cheer about, and the Bears went three-and-out to start the second  half. Cutler, who banged up a knee and an elbow in the first half,  bounced a third-down throw to Devin Hester. It’s still a close game, but  the way this is going the Bears may need to score on defense. First half in the books. Packers, 14-0. Rodgers is 10 for 15 passing for  156 yards, and the Packers have outgained the Bears, 252 yards to 103.  Not looking good for the home team. Cornerback Sam Shields, an undrafted free agent who played three seasons at wide  receiver at Miami, makes an apparent acrobatic interception of a Cutler  pass to Johnny Knox just short of the goal line. Driver looks relieved.  Booth review, the call stands. Rodgers must be seeing something in the Bears defense; his 12-yard  scramble is at least the third time he’s stung the Bears running left  against the flow of the defense. The Bears need a turnover badly, and  they get a huge one when Donald Driver muffs a shoestring catch and  Lance Briggs intercepts with 49 seconds left in the half. Corner blitz from the rookie Sam Shields gets to Cutler, forcing a fumble.  Packers defense has been all over Cutler, sometimes with blitzes,  sometimes with a straight-up rush. Bears punt with 1:52 left in the  half. Bears tight end Greg Olson, a Jersey guy (he’s from Wayne), does a nice job  keeping linebacker Clay Matthews from intercepting a Cutler flutterball. Rodgers talked during the week about how much he enjoys playing  cat and mouse with Bears linebacker Brian Urlacher, as each call signals on  their respective sides of the ball. Rodgers laughed recalling the time a  couple of years ago when Urlacher’s voice cracked at a tense moment.  Urlacher appeared to get the better of Rodgers on this drive, and the  Bears have a little more than four minutes before halftime to get on the  scoreboard. Shaky holding penalty on running back Chester Taylor trying to block linebacker Desmond  Bishop wrecks a Bears drive. If Taylor was holding, how did Bishop still  manage to get a hand on Jay Cutler? Bears punt. At this point Packers  hold big edge in first downs (13 to 3) and yardage (186 to 79). Interesting to recall that Starks was seconds away from becoming a Bear on draft day  until Chicago General Manager Jerry Angelo changed his mind. With Green Bay leading, 14-0, Cutler needs to move the Bears on  this drive or he’ll be hearing it from the crowd. James Starks goes in from 4 yards out to give Green Bay a two-touchdown lead with 11:19 left in the first half. The drive really started when the Packers forced the Bears to punt from their own end zone. Green Bay started the drive at the Chicago 44 and it didn’t take long for Rodgers to drive them down for the score. The Bears switched defensive end Julius Peppers from the right side to the left side, where he is matched up against Green Bay’s T.J. Lang. The Bears promptly got to Rodgers on two of the next three plays, with Peppers knocking him down the second time. On third down Jay Cutler overthrows Devin Hester down the left side. Hester  had Packers safety Charlie Peprah turned around. Cutler is upset, but  the way loose turf is flying around here, it’s only a matter of time  until some DB falls down in coverage. For Green Bay, T.J. Lang replaces Chad Clifton (stinger) at left tackle. Aaron Rodgers starts smartly, completing his first two passes to Greg  Jennings for 22 and 26 yards. Chris Harris, playing with that torn hip  muscle, planted Jennings on the first catch, but Jennings slipped a  Harris tackle on the second. Packers drive for a score, with Rodgers  taking it left on a naked bootleg and diving over the pylon. Packers,  7-0. Rodgers goes 4 for 4 with 76 yards passing on the drive. Weather check: It’s 19 degrees at game time, winds out of the  south-southeast at 8 miles an hour, so with the wind chill it feels like 8  degrees. Not bad. Bears safety Chris Harris has a torn left hip muscle, but he’s starting.  According to The Chicago Tribune, he was expected to receive a pain-killing injection this morning. Harris’s backup is a rookie, Major Wright. For Green Bay, Erik Walden starts at right outside linebacker for the injured Frank Zombo (knee). It feels a lot warmer today than it did in Green Bay for the Giants-Packers  N.F.C. championship game in 2008. That was the day the ink  in my pens froze while I was in the parking lot interviewing fans. This  morning I walked from my hotel to the media hotel, about 15-20 minutes,  without my face freezing. The city of Chicago awoke to a coating of lake-effect snow, enough to slick up the sidewalks but not to create havoc at Soldier Field. The tarp was on overnight, and two hours before kickoff the field was clear and awash in sunshine. Itâs cold, though, about 19 degrees with a moderate wind out of the southeast. Ten minutes at the edge of tunnel leading onto the field with my head uncovered was all my ears could stand. One heavily-bundled security guard said the wind felt about the same as it did last week, though he cautioned that could change in five minutes. The wind chills are likely to be close to zero or below when the N.F.C. championship game kicks off. Hereâs the weird thing about the field: It actually looks more green up close than it does on TV, though calling it âgreenâ is a stretch. Less brown, maybe? Weâll see how the footing is. Thereâs talk of putting in artificial turf in the future, but for now, thereâs something appropriate about two venerable franchises playing a championship game on the real stuff. By the way, one of the guards I talked to offered this up: âHow great would a Bears-Jets Super Bowl be?â Well, how about it? What do you think?
