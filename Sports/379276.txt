The Women’s World Cup celebrated its 20th birthday this summer, and boy did it look grown up. There was Marta’s dribbling and Abby Wambach’s headers and (for a while) Germany’s efficiency, but we all knew we’d see that. The surprises came from other sources: the confident choreography of Japan’s passing game, the sublime passes of France’s Louisa Necib, the gritty toughness of Canada’s Christine Sinclair, who scored a breathtaking goal while playing with with a broken nose. In the end, 2011 was the year the Women’s World Cup stopped being a green-grass version of the N.C.A.A. women’s basketball tournament, where only one or two teams have a chance to win. That’s fitting, probably, since Cinderella was a girl who always deserved better, if only she could catch a break. This year, the breaks finally came.

In Germany, the contenders expanded beyond the usual suspects (Germany, the United States, Brazil) to include teams like France and Japan. Australia and England each won two games, and Sweden won four. Japan reached its first final, and the Americans finally lost one. Even tiny Equatorial Guinea had a puncher’s chance, thanks to its beaded-haired captain, Anonman.  And for the first time in the tournament’s history, the champion was neither unbeaten nor the winner of its first-round group. In other sports they call that parity. In women’s soccer, it’s called overdue. Grahame Jones, writing in the Los Angeles Times, predicts even better times could be ahead: No one is suggesting that women’s soccer is on the wane. The opposite is true. But remember, only 20 years ago, there was no Women’s World Cup; only 15 years ago, there was no women’s Olympic soccer tournament. It is a sport still in its relative infancy but already with a rich and colorful history, with a glorious chapter now added. The most encouraging thing about the sixth Women’s World Cup that ended Sunday night after a 32-game run in nine German cities was the quality of play in the tournament. France caressed the ball around the field, and Japan did it even better. Brazil showed flashes of unbelievable skill, and Germany gave a glimpse of a multicultural future that has oppenents of its men’s team so spooked.  And while parity is a great thing for viewers, it is also pushing the game’s powers forward. The United States, which held the high ground for decades, was pushed around by Sweden in a loss, needed a miracle goal to beat Brazil, and saved it best game for the final — and lost anyway. Brian Phillips, writing for Slate, notes: 
The bad news for Team USA is that the American women’s structural advantages in organization, funding, and training seem to be dissipating as the level of technique in the international women’s game rises. If anything, Team USA is slightly less technically proficient, and more reliant on raw power, than the squad that won the 1999 World Cup. As long as Brazil’s players look like they’ve been introduced to each other in the bus on the way to the game, the American women’s superior cohesion and fitness might neutralize their opponents’ superior individual touch. But if the rest of the world starts to close the organization gap â and there were signs at this World Cup, with France and Japan, that that’s happening â then the U.S. women will need more than the glorious battering ram of Abby Wambach’s head to keep them near the top of the sport. In that sense, actually, the final was its own silver lining: The Americans showed that they could thrive with a more nuanced game, even if they didn’t quite win with it. Now if FIFA would just stay out of the women’s game. But no. Instead, it will expand the tournament to 24 teams from this year’s 16 for the next World Cup, in Canada in 2015. One could argue that the tournament has room for more teams (China missed out this year, and some European countries could no doubt hold their own), but South America and Africa have not shown the commitment to keep pace with other growing programs. And with many countries in the Middle East refusing to even consider the prospect of allowing their women to play, or supporting them if they do, one has to wonder if the gains made in style and competitiveness will be lost. The 6-0 and 10-0 shellackings of the past will no doubt return when the world’s top teams reconvene, and that will be bad for the game. But at least that’s four years off.
