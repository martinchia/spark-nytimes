9:45 P.M.Halftime notes for two games


Brody Schmidt/Associated PressOklahoma State’s Jeremy Smith scored a touchdown in the first quarter.
The roof has caved in on Oklahoma, which seems to have left its game in the locker room, if not back in Norman. Randle just scored again, capping a way-too-easy scoring drive to give Oklahoma State a 24-0 lead.
Itâs difficult to imagine a scenario where the Sooners, based on how theyâve played in the first half, can reverse O.S.U.âs momentum a win this game to take home the Big 12 crown.
Let the debate begin: Oklahoma State or Alabama as L.S.U.âs partner on Jan. 9 in the B.C.S. National Championship Game? I can see the case for either team.
At least the other two games are close. Virginia Tech kicked a field goal late in the first half to tie the A.C.C. championship at 10-10 at halftime. After losing to Clemson in October, Virginia Techâs David Wilson told his team, âTheyâre not better than us.â
âAnd I told them we werenât going to lose any more games. And I told them I mean it.â Wilson has been good to his word: since losing to Clemson on Oct. 1, Virginia Tech has rolled off seven straight wins in A.C.C. play.
Wisconsin and Michigan State are playing on FOX, which means that broadcast will last until at least midnight. With three minutes left in the first half, Michigan State holds a 22-21 lead.




9:28 P.M.Bedlam in Stillwater


Heâs no longer a Heisman candidate, and yeah, his 2011 season is not as statistically impressive as his 2010 campaign. But Landry Jones remains one of the top three or four quarterbacks in the country, along with his opposite number in Stillwater.
And O.S.U. definitely doesnât want him to get in a rhythm. Jones seems to be in the groove on Oklahomaâs latest drive, where the Sooners have gone into a hurry-up mode to solid results.
Jones hit on his first four attempts before throwing incomplete, and nearly being intercepted, on his most recent attempt.
You know why this sometimes seems like an exercise in futility? Because just as I write about how Jones seems to developing some momentum, Oklahoma State brings the house, sacks Jones, forces a fumble, recovers the fumble and rumbles down to the Oklahoma one-yard line.
So for the Sooners, a drive that would have ended in at least three points rapidly turns into a 17-0 deficit.
Joseph Randle got the touchdown, his 22nd on the year, to give the Cowboys a commanding lead. Itâs Bedlam in Stillwater.




9:16 P.M.The Big Ten isn’t boring tonight


Think Big Ten football is boring? Well, sometimes it is. Then, all of a sudden, itâs not. Take tonightâs Big Ten title game, where it seems as if a Big 12 game has broken out.
Wisconsin has had three drives. The first went 71 yards and ended in the touchdown. The second went 60 yards and ended in a touchdown. The third, thanks to a short field, went only 24 yards. It still ended in a touchdown.
Michigan State has had two drives: 59 yards and a touchdown, 80 yards and a touchdown. The latter ended with a 30-yard touchdown pass on fourth down by Kirk Cousins, his 22nd touchdown on the season. That tied Drew Stantonâs school record.
Thirty-five points. Zero points. Little more than a quarter in the books. The Big Ten isnât boring tonight.




9:02 P.M.No power in Clemson? That could be a problem.


Chuck Burton/Associated PressVirginia Tech’s D.J. Coles dove into the end zone in the first half.
Ouch. According to Greg Wallace of the Anderson (S.C.) Independent-Mail, power seems to be out in Clemson, home of the Tigers, and may be out until midnight.
So you know that game the entire area cares about? You know, the A.C.C. Championship Game? No dice. I guess fans in Clemson can follow on the Internet, however.
What? The Internet wonât work without power? Oh. Ouch.




8:58 P.M.Montee Ball scores again (and again)


Andy Lyons/Getty ImagesMontee Ball, rushing for a touchdown in the first quarter against Michigan State, has scored 36 touchdowns this season.
Montee Ball scored four times against U.N.L.V. He scored twice against Oregon State, Northern Illinois and South Dakota.
He scored four times against Nebraska, three times against Indiana. He scored twice against Michigan State and Ohio State. He scored three times against Purdue, Minnesota and Illinois.
Ball scored four times against Penn State. Heâs already scored twice tonight, helping give Wisconsin a 21-7 lead over Michigan State. Oh, and Ballâs completed a 32-yard pass to Russell Wilson, helping set up his first touchdown.
Add those up yet? In all, Ball has scored 36 touchdowns, three fewer than the N.C.A.A. single-season record held by Barry Sanders. He probably should get an invite to Manhattan for the Heisman Trophy ceremony, right?




8:46 P.M.Not a good time to be tweaking


More great stuff from ESPNâs Big 12 blogger David Ubben, who writes of Oklahomaâs game of musical chairs in the secondary:
âOklahoma tried Javon Harris. Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III and receiver Kendall Wright made it obvious that wasn’t going to work. Apparently, neither will experienced senior Sam Proctor.
Oklahoma’s Tony Jefferson, who most often plays a nickel back position, is playing deep safety, something Bob Stoops has said a handful of times he has no intention of doing. Joseph Ibiloye replaced Jefferson underneath at the nickel back.â
Basically, itâs not a good time to be trying out news things in the secondary, not when Brandon Weeden, Justin Blackmon and the Cowboys feature the second-most prolific passing game in the country.
Can O.U. slow down Oklahoma State? And when push comes to shove, can any defensive back on the roster hang with Blackmon? If not, the Sooners will need to devote multiple backs to hanging with the all-American. And thatâs where O.S.U. gets you.




8:40 P.M.On the board in the night starts


There are points on the board in each of tonightâs three key games.
Oklahoma State struck first against Oklahoma. It was a four-play drive highlighted by a 53-yard completion from the quarterback Brandon Weeden to Tracy Moore, with the latter doing most of the work on his catch-and-run jaunt down the left sideline. Jeremy Smith scored from nine yards out to give O.S.U. a 7-0 lead.
The Cowboys have found Oklahomaâs weakness: the pass. Of course, Oklahoma State passes on anyone, anytime, anywhere. But can the Cowboys pass on L.S.U.?
After an awful November, Tajh Boydâs December is off to a good start. Heâs completed five of his first six attempts against Virginia Tech, including a 24-yard strike to Dwayne Allen to take a 7-0 lead. In my mind, Allen is the best tight end in college football.
And in Indianapolis, Wisconsinâs touchdown is matched on the ensuing drive by Michigan State. Itâs tied, 7-7. Surprise! Wisconsinâs touchdown was not scored by the running back Montee Ball.




8:23 P.M.Mercifully, Fresno State’s year is almost over


Fresno State has been the most disappointing non-B.C.S. conference team in the country. That Boise State lost one game isnât a disappointment; itâs upsetting, but to call the Broncos a disappointment would ignore the fact that you, if youâre like most fans, were rooting for the Broncos to lose all season.
Fresno Stateâs disappointing season will mercifully come to a close tonight, when the Bulldogs travel to San Diego State to cap a 13-game regular season. The added game might give Fresno nine losses, something the program hasnât done since 1973. It wasnât supposed to be like this.
The Bulldogs opened September with two fairly competitive losses to California and Nebraska. That was followed by two wins and another loss to Mississippi; that loss wasnât good, but it did come against a B.C.S. conference opponent. Fresno showed its true colors in a 57-7 loss to Boise State on Oct. 7: quite simply, the Bulldogs quit.
This was a team most had pegged as a leading contender for a depleted WAC. If Fresno was ever going to win it, thought most, it would be now. Since Fresno is Mountain West-bound in 2012, that elusive WAC crown, something the Bulldogs havenât taken home since 1999, is never going to happen.




8:10 P.M.Turn off L.S.U., look to Wisconsin (and others)


Itâs 8 p.m. on the East Coast, so we can all finally turn the page on L.S.U.âs laugher against Georgia and turn our attention to three games with B.C.S. implications.
Despite losing in East Lansing in October, Wisconsin is favored in tonightâs Big Ten Championship Game. The Badgers followed that loss, which came on a Hail Mary pass from Kirk Cousins to Keith Nichol, with another painful loss to Ohio State.
But since the matching losses in East Lansing and Columbus, Wisconsin has picked up right where it left off. The Badgers made it look easy through mid-October, not breaking a sweat against four also-rans in September before dispatching with Nebraska and Indiana by a combined score of 107-24.
It was more of the same in November, minus a puzzlingly close win at Illinois two weeks ago. Any question that the Badgers were not the team we saw through Oct. 15 was answered last Saturday: Badgers 45, Penn State 7. Wisconsin could have picked the final score.
Only four teams have gained more than 300 yards against the Badgers this fall: Nebraska, Michigan State, Ohio State and Illinois. Only three teams, the same list minus Illinois, averaged more than five yards per play against the Badgers. In 2010, for example, six opponents averaged more than six yards per play.
Despite losing two games in the regular season, could this yearâs Badgers be better than the 2010 team that played in the Rose Bowl? Itâs hard to say otherwise, especially seeing the way Wisconsin has buttoned up last yearâs occasionally leaky defense.
And yet it was this defense, on back-to-back weeks, that sprung a leak with a game in the balance. Michigan State gained 399 yards of total offense; 44 came on the gameâs final play. The Buckeyes gained 357 yards; 40 came on their final offensive play.
Even with a win tonight in Indianapolis, could Wisconsinâs season be defined by the games it let get away? Better yet, can the Badgers take any solace, even if the year ends at 12-2, in the knowledge that they may be the best team in program history?




7:57 P.M.More of the same from L.S.U.


Simply more of the same from L.S.U., which has turned in a similar script from its win over Arkansas last Friday.
Against the Razorbacks, the Tigers fell down by 14-0 before winning by 41-17. Today, the Tigers fell down by 10 points in the first half but have now scored 42 unanswered points.
The question isnât whether L.S.U. is the best team in the country. This is obvious. Hereâs the question: Can anyone beat L.S.U.? How do you beat L.S.U.?
Show a tendency to pass first, as Georgia did today, and the Tigers will send the house and disrupt your passing game. Show a tendency to run and, well, itâs not going to work. You canât run on L.S.U. for 60 minutes.
Can Oklahoma State beat L.S.U.? Can Alabama? Can anyone beat L.S.U.? And should how a team would fare against the Tigers be the tiebreaker for voters still hedging over whether to put the Cowboys, should they win tonight, or Crimson Tide No. 2 in the final regular season poll?




7:38 P.M.North Texas, Dunbar run wild to end 2011


How bad is Middle Tennessee State? Before getting to that, a word on the North Texas running back Lance Dunbar, who entered todayâs game against the Blue Raiders needing 140 yards to break the former U.N.T. star Patrick Cobbsâ school and Sun Belt Conference record.
Dunbar ended his day with 313 yards, giving him the two records and an F.B.S. high in 2011. North Texas won by 59-7, underlining how well the Mean Green played in their first season under Dan McCarney and how poorly Middle Tennessee, 2-10, played in its sixth season under Rick Stockstill.
The two wins came over Memphis and Florida Atlantic, two teams right alongside M.T.S.U. among the bottom five teams in the country. The 10 defeats included a six-game losing streak to end the season. It was a streak to forget: Middle Tennessee lost to Louisiana-Lafayette, Tennessee, Louisiana-Monroe, Arkansas State, Florida International and North Texas by the combined score of 246-78.
I think Middle Tennessee State needs to think long and hard about the programâs future under Stockstill. Heâs had some unfortunate hires at offensive coordinator that has stymied his teamâs production over the last few years, but the buck stops at his desk.




7:16 P.M.This one’s over, so let’s look ahead


L.S.U. just capped a 70-yard scoring drive, more than doubling its yardage output for the game. Prior to the possession, which ended with a Kenny Hilliard touchdown, the Tigers had 50 yards of total offense.
Hilliard, by the way, just tied an SEC Championship Game record with three touchdowns.
So this one is over. L.S.U. leads by 28-10; Georgia has no chance, absolutely zero chance, of coming back and winning this game. If the Bulldogs donât show some fortitude defensively the score may get out of hand.
So letâs look ahead to tonight. There are three conference title games kicking off at 8 p.m., though only two carry that official title. Oklahomaâs date with Oklahoma State isnât an âofficialâ Big 12 championship game, but the winner of that game earns the leagueâs automatic bid to the Fiesta Bowl.
Clemson and Virginia Tech meet for the second time. In October, the Tigers put the clamps down on David Wilson and the Hokies for a 23-3 win. The Hokies havenât lost since. The Tigers lost three of four in November.
In another regular season rematch, Wisconsin and Michigan State meet in the inaugural Big Ten title game with a Rose Bowl berth on the line. Asked yesterday about any perceived lack of interest in this rematch, Bret Beliema replied, âAnyone who watched our first game, if you donât want a sequel to that…”




7:07 P.M.Looking ahead to B.Y.U.-Hawaii


B.Y.U. is 8-3, but itâs not like the Cougars are running through the SEC. Well, the Cougars did get past one SEC team, Mississippi, but only by a single point. Nothing to write home about, in other words. But in all, only one of B.Y.U.âs wins, Utah State, has come against a team with more than four wins.
The Cougars have as many wins against bowl eligible teams as F.C.S. teams. It hasnât really been the year the program may have planned in its first season as an F.B.S. Independent.
What did the Cougars expect? What did I expect? I thought B.Y.U. would go 10-2; 9-3, with a win over Hawaii tonight, isnât that much worse, but the Cougars have lost to the only three teams of consequence on the schedule.Â Texas sneaked past by a single point. Utah blew their doors off. T.C.U. had more than enough in the tank for a 38-28 win.
The wins have come over the Rebels, the Aggies, U.C.F., San Jose State, Oregon State, Idaho State, Idaho and New Mexico State. But there have been positive signs. The offense took a giant step forward once Riley Nelson replaced Jake Heaps at quarterback.
That Heaps played well in Nelsonâs stead while the latter deals with an injury is a great sign for his still-promising future. The defense has improved significantly over the last two months. But yes, the improvement does coincide with the easing up of the schedule.




6:57 P.M.Protecting Murray has become an issue


Itâs the toughest thing for a freshman running back to learn: pass protection? Who do I block? Do I start inside and work out or vice versa? Go high or low?
Georgiaâs Isaiah Crowell was the nationâs top running back recruit coming out of high school in February, perhaps the programâs most highly-touted prospect at the position since â gasp â Herschel Walker.
Heâs shown the sort of speed, agility and shiftiness befitting his five-star status. But Crowellâs work in pass protection still leaves much to be desired, as illustrated by several blown assignments during the third quarter.
As a whole, Georgiaâs inability to combat the L.S.U. pass rush is a major impediment to the Bulldogsâ attempted comeback from this 21-10 deficit. After keeping Aaron Murray clean for much of the first half, the Bulldogs have become the hunted, not the hunter.
I canât imagine a scenario where Georgia comes back and wins this game. And yes, I know thereâs plenty of game to be played. But the L.S.U. defense is loaded with sharks, and thereâs blood in the water.




6:43 P.M.Another Mathieu moment


John Bazemore/Associated PressTyrann Mathieu returned a punt for a touchdown in the first half, and returned another one deep into Georgia territory late in the second half.
Remember Robert Griffin IIIâs line at halftime? He was 6 of 11 for 161 yards and 2 scores, one passing and one rushing. Now, with seven minutes left in the fourth quarter, Griffin is 15 of 22 for 320 yards and 4 scores, two through the air and two on the ground.
And Baylor is taking Texas to school, 48-24, meaning Baylorâs going to finish the regular season 9-3. Is there any reason why Griffin shouldnât win the Heisman?
And what about Mathieu? Thereâs really no way to describe his most recent punt return. Letâs just say that if it had continued all the way to the end zone, he might have been the Heisman frontrunner.
By the way, L.S.U. is doing its usual thing to Georgia. Mathieuâs long, winding punt return (Georgia should just kick it out of bounds, by the way) has the Tigers on the doorstep once again, a play or two away from taking a 21-10 lead.
If it gets to 21-10, we can put this game to bed. So much more three SEC teams in the B.C.S.




6:33 P.M.Georgia couldn’t have scripted it any worse


Of all the things Georgia couldnât afford to do coming out of halftime, Iâd say fumbling on its third play from scrimmage ranks at the top of list. Though fumbling on its first play would have been worse, I suppose.
Aaron Murray, fighting for a first down on third and long, had the ball stripped away by a pair of L.S.U. defenders at his own 26-yard line. The fumble was recovered by Tyrann Mathieu, of course.
Two plays later, L.S.U. takes its first lead of the game. After Jordan Jefferson found Reuben Randle for the first L.S.U. first down of the game, the running back Kenny Hilliard rumbled into the end zone from 15 yards out to make it a 14-10 score.
Georgia couldnât have scripted it any worse. L.S.U. couldnât have asked for a better start. Now that the Tigers have the lead, can Georgia rebound? This game seems a lot like L.S.U.âs win over Arkansas, does it not?




6:07 P.M.From Dr. Pepper to L.S.U. quarterback


Itâs halftime at the Georgia Dome, which means one thing: itâs time for the Dr. Pepper tuition giveaway thingamajig, where two contestants try to throw football into oversized soda cans to win $100,000 to help pay for college.
The winner, one Ms. Padilla-Rodriguez, went with the chest-pass route. Not pretty, but hey, whatever works.
There is no truth to the rumor that Ms. Padilla-Rodriguez signed her Dr. Pepper check before using the same pen to sign a Letter of Intent to play quarterback at L.S.U. in the second half.




6:00 P.M.Halftime in the Georgia Dome


L.S.U. almost had a first down. Almost, almost, almost. Ignore that it would have come via a roughing the kicker penalty on Georgia. Instead, the call was running into the kicker, a five-yard penalty that still forced the Tigers into another punt.
At the half, Georgia has 133 yards of total offense. L.S.U. has 12 yard of total offense. L.S.U. has zero first downs. Not a one. Georgiaâs offense slowed down over the second half of the second quarter, but the Bulldogs have tasted some success through the air.
The Tigersâ M.V.P. is clearly the punter Brad Wing. He was also the undisputed M.V.P. of Novemberâs win over Alabama, by the way. Mathieu has the big play, but Wingâs punt to end the previous series, which put Georgia deep in its own territory, set up Mathieuâs return.
So, to recap:
L.S.U. has zero first downs and trails by only three points. I can see it now: one half of the B.C.S. National Championship Game loses in its conference title game without getting a first down. And in the title game, meets an Alabama team that didnât win its own division.




5:50 P.M.Georgia goes conservative; did Mathieu score?


L.S.U. has more punt returns for touchdowns as first downs. One, zero. I canât say enough about the Georgia front seven, which has dominated the line of scrimmage throughout the first half.
A special tip of the hat goes to the former junior college transfer John Jenkins, a mountain-sized nose tackle who has stepped up his game over the last six weeks. It took Jenkins a few weeks to get acclimated to the college game, in part because he was not where he needed to be in terms of his conditioning.
Now? Heâs a handful. L.S.U. has been unable to keep him under wraps.
Georgia, which gets the ball to start the second half, is playing it conservatively on offense with less than two minutes left in the half. L.S.U. is calling its own timeouts to get the ball back with a shot at scoring before heading into the locker room.
Strange sight on review: Did Mathieu flip the ball to the sideline referee before crossing the goal line on his touchdown return? It seems that he did, going off a slow-motion replay from the CBS broadcast.




5:35 P.M.Mathieu does it again


Thereâs your game-changing play. The L.S.U. cornerback Tyran Mathieu, perhaps the nationâs most electrifying player, returned Drew Butlerâs punt 62 yards for a touchdown to cut Georgiaâs lead to 10-7.
Mathieu is incredible. Heâs on a whole other level. No other player in college football has flashed the same sort of big-play ability.
Against Oregon, his fumble recovery of a muffed punt was the turning point in L.S.U.âs big win. He returned another fumble for a touchdown against Kentucky. Heâs a tackling machine despite his smaller stature. Mathieu has a nose for the football, where on defense or special teams. 
And the numbers donât tell the whole story. If not for his midseason suspension for a violation of team rules, I think Mathieu had as strong a case for the Heisman as another recent dominant defender, Nebraskaâs Ndamukong Suh.




5:28 P.M.What lead is big enough?


Chris Keane/ReutersL.S.U.’s Tharold Simon broke up a pass in the second quarter.
L.S.U. has gone three-and-out on each of its five possessions. Remember what I said about Georgiaâs defense? L.S.U.âs missteps have come because of Georgiaâs ability to put the clamps down defensively.
Georgiaâs wounds on offense have been nearly entirely self-inflicted. Murray missed King in the end zone on the first series, leading to a field goal. Later, Mitchell dropped a touchdown. Itâs 10-0; it could be 17-0, if not worse.
Why is this important? Because just eight days ago, Arkansas held a 14-0 second quarter lead against L.S.U. only to lose by 24 points, 41-17.
You need to take advantage of any and all opportunities against the Tigers. L.S.U. is confident that eventually, the tide will turn in its favor. Georgia needs to create some more breathing room before the Tigers make their inevitable run.




5:20 P.M.Heisman watch with Robert Griffin III


A win is the biggest thing for Robert Griffin III, as noted earlier. A victory would make Baylor 9-3 and very much in play for a B.C.S. berth. If Griffin leads the Bears to a B.C.S. bowl, well, he should win the Heisman.
He hasnât played great against Texas, however. He started by completing his second pass to Kendall Wright for a 59-yard touchdown. Over all, heâs completed 6 of 11 attempts for 161 yards with that touchdown and an interception along with nine yards on eight carries.
Either Griffin needs to have a stronger second half or he needs to keep Baylor on path for 9-3. At the half, the Bears lead Texas by 24-21.




5:07 P.M.Georgia 10, L.S.U. 0


It seems as if this game will come down to one factor: L.S.U.âs ability to get pressure on Aaron Murray. Given time, Georgiaâs sophomore quarterback is seemingly doing the impossible.
Heâs having success against the L.S.U. secondary. Murray is 7 of 15 for 99 yards and a touchdown, the latter to the tight end Aron White to give the Bulldogs a 10-0 lead.
In all, Georgia has 133 yards of total offense; L.S.U. has 11. So far, this game is playing right into Georgiaâs hands. The Tigers will find it very difficult to work their way back into this game offensively if they become one-dimensional.
Georgiaâs pass rush is ferocious enough to make life very difficult for Jordan Jefferson should he be placed in clear passing downs.
At the end of one quarter: Georgia 10, L.S.U. 0.




4:56 P.M.Georgia winning the battle up front


Run, pass, sack, punt. Run, pass, run, punt. Pass, run, pass, punt.
Through 12 minutes, itâs the Georgia defense thatâs dominating this game, not its opposite number from Baton Rouge.
L.S.U. has had the ball three times, run nine plays and punted three times. Georgia, thanks in part to an onside kick recovery, has controlled the ball and field position.
Unfortunately, the Bulldogs have only three points to show for it. You could make the case that each of the Bulldogsâ first two possessions should have ended with a touchdown: Murray missed King and Mitchell dropped a sure score.
Georgia is getting it done along the line of scrimmage. Offensively, the Bulldogsâ front is opening up holes in the running game; this is surprising, given how weâve acclaimed L.S.U.âs front seven as the nationâs best.
Defensively, Georgiaâs 3-4 look is giving L.S.U. fits. The Bulldogs are huge up front, very N.F.L.-like, and tough to move off the ball. If Georgia can continue to win on first down itâll be very difficult for the Tigers to move the ball.
Murray just found Orson Charles, one of the nationâs best tight ends, for a big third down conversion. The Bulldogs are back inside the L.S.U. red zone. Can they get six, not settle for a field goal try?




4:44 P.M.Hugh Freeze is one popular guy


If Arkansas State beats Troy this afternoon, giving the Red Wolves a 10-2 record, Hugh Freeze will have made $20,216 per win in 2011. In comparison, Mississippi will have paid Houston Nutt $1.4 million per win in 2011. Not surprisingly, Nutt wonât be returning to Oxford in 2012.
Freeze is the lowest-paid coach in America, according to USA Todayâs database of salaries, which does not contain contract details for those coaches working at private universities. So you can see why Freeze has become such a coaching commodity as Arkansas State wraps up its regular season; you can also see why Mississippi, where Freeze was once an assistant, is interested in his services.
Where could he land in 2012? If he goes to any major school, Iâd put the Rebels as a heavy favorite. But donât rule out the potential for Freeze to make a slight jump up the coaching ladder by moving to Southern Mississippi, should Larry Fedora be hired by a Kansas or Arizona State.
That would be painful for Arkansas State, but the Southern Mississippi job would represent a step up for Freeze. Should he win in Hattiesburg, Freeze might become even more popular than he is today. Though that hardly seems possible.
And considering the mutual interest with Mississippi, do you think Freeze, whose team just kicked off against Troy, might ask for a tape of this SEC title game? You know, just to get a head start on 2012. Maybe.




4:37 P.M.A missed opportunity for Georgia


Scott Cunningham/Getty ImagesCarlton Thomas and Georgia struggled to establish the run game against L.S.U.’s quick and talented front seven.
Mark Richtâs not necessarily a gambler. Other coaches in the SEC, such as his counterpart on the opposite sideline, Les Miles, are better known for taking chances.
He rolled the dice after Georgiaâs field goal, however. Taking L.S.U. completely off guard, Richt dialed up an onside kick; it was recovered by the safety Alec Ogletree.
Unfortunately, this drive ends in a missed field goal. Walsh missed a 45-yard try, pushing it right to keep this a 3-0 game. On the play before, however, Georgia botched another golden opportunity.
First: Georgiaâs drive received a huge boost from a holding call on the L.S.U. cornerback Morris Claiborne on a third down play after the drive seemed doomed at 2nd-19. 
The Bulldogs got 18 yards on a Murray pass to the tight end Orson Charles, setting up a short third down conversion. Instead of pounding away at the L.S.U. defensive front, Georgia went play-action: Murray tucked it away, rolled to his right and threw to his receiver, who was held by Claiborne after making a break towards the end zone.
Still, Georgia is missing on some gift-wrapped touchdowns. On the first series, Murray missed on an open King in the end zone.
This drive? My goodness. The freshman receiver Malcolm Mitchell, who leads the team in receiving yards despite missing three games, dropped a sure-fire touchdown along the right sideline on the play prior to Walshâs missed field goal.
The pass hit Mitchell right in the stomach. An inexcusable drop. Mitchell could have skipped into the end zone. A 3-0 lead is fine. A 10-0 lead would have been enormous for the Bulldogs.




4:23 P.M.Georgia takes a 3-0 lead


Georgia strikes first. After L.S.Uâs first drive ended in a punt, Blair Walsh hits a 40-yard field goal to give the Bulldogs a 3-0 lead.
The big play was a 44-yard connection between Aaron Murray and Tavarres King, who was freed by a Murray pump fake that seemed to freeze the L.S.U. safeties.
Georgia didnât pass once: five plays, five passes. And on third down from the L.S.U. 22, Murray had an open King running a post route into the end zone but misfired. It could be 7-0, but Georgia should be happy with 3-0.
L.S.U. will button things up in the secondary. Itâs now back on the Georgia defense to get stop on first down and pressure on third down.




4:11 P.M.Importance of pro-Georgia crowd?


One factor heavily in Georgiaâs favor is the home field. The SEC title game is being played at the Georgia Dome, right in the Bulldogsâ backyard in Atlanta, and the crowd will be heavily pro-Georgia.
And thatâs not solely because of the schoolâs close proximity to Atlanta. It stands to reason that since L.S.U. is heading to New Orleans on Jan. 9, many fans might save the cost of traveling to Atlanta, buying a ticket and paying for lodging when theyâd rather go to the title game rematch against Alabama.
If this game is close in the fourth quarter, could the pro-Georgia crowd give the Bulldogs a lift?




4:04 P.M.Georgia’s defense can win this game


L.S.U. is going to the B.C.S. championship game either way. Win or lose, weâre looking at a rematch of the Nov. 5 game in Tuscaloosa, when the Tigers beat Alabama with a field goal in overtime.
This game still holds tremendous meaning to Georgia, winners of 10 straight after an 0-2 start that had many calling this season Mark Richtâs last with the program. Not even close: Richt is my pick for SEC Coach of the Year.
Can the Bulldogs score the upset? Absolutely. And if they do, itâll be on the back of a defense thatâs as good, mean, nasty, physical and opportunistic as any group in the country.
Georgia allowed 77 points to Boise State and South Carolina during its 0-2 start. Georgiaâs next five opponents combined for 83 points.Â Georgiaâs last five opponents have combined for 70 points.
The story has been this defense, which has gone from stressful to stingy since South Carolina. Hereâs how Georgia beats you on defense: size up front, speed on the edge, a nose for the ball along the back. Georgia throttles you with a time-honored blueprint, one youâll see in action this afternoon against L.S.U.
Be physical at the point of attack. This goes for defensive linemen and cornerbacks alike. Confuse protection. This, the ability to disguise, is one of the beauties of Todd Granthamâs 3-4 system. Get mean.
And what does L.S.U. have on defense that Georgia doesnât? Name value. Depth, especially along the defensive line. Cockiness â that the Tigers have in spades. Meanness? Thatâs a shared trait. Ability to stop the run? Also shared. Rush the quarterback? Shut things down in the secondary? Shared and shared.
The point is this: Georgia can win this game. Would it come with beauty points? Nope. Beauty has left the building, replaced by two nasty, talented defenses.




3:50 P.M.Utah State, 6-5, wonders what could have been


Utah State clinched a bowl berth by beating Nevada, 21-17, last Saturday. The victory was Utah Stateâs fourth straight, all coming by a touchdown or less, which carries enormous meaning for the program: for starters, the Aggies, prior to this fall, hadnât won more than four games in a season since 2000.
Two days after the victory, on Monday, Utah State accepted a bid to the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl â a real bowl game â on Dec. 17. All in all, this season, Gary Andersenâs third with the program, has been Utah Stateâs most successful year in a generation. So why are you left wondering what could have been?
Because Utah State, which just kicked off against New Mexico State, could be 8-3. Or 9-2. Or 10-1. While November found the Aggies coming out on the winning end of hard-fought, narrowly-decided games, the Aggies left points, and opportunities, on the board in September and October.
The Aggies led Auburn 10 points with roughly two minutes to go but lost. It was a similar story against Colorado State, B.Y.U. and Louisiana Tech. Each came in September and October.Â These losses, especially over such a short span of time, can test a team. They will most certainly test a fan base, even one like Utah Stateâs, a fan base more accustomed to defeat than victory.
A win over Louisiana Tech might have given the Aggies the WAC title. A win over Auburn would have the programâs best since leaving the Big West Conference in 2000. A win over B.Y.U. might have given Utah State its second Beehive Boot, something it hasnât done since 1971-74. What could have been.Â 
The silver lining, of course, is that the Aggies have rebounded. And the Aggies have bounced back in a satisfying â but still palpitation-inducing â fashion, winning those four straight games by a combined 16 points. Is this a turning point for the program?




3:41 P.M.Robert Griffin III runs for the Heisman


So Andrew Luck wonât play again until January. His regular season, unfortunately, is over. The same goes for Trent Richardson, who ended his regular season by romping all over Auburn in last weekendâs Iron Bowl.
One of the three Heisman leaders has one final bullet in his gun, however. Robert Griffin III has one more game with which to make his case, and fortunately for Griffin, itâs against Texas. Say what you will about the Longhorns, who have improved over 2010 but remain a work-in-progress: Texas is still Texas, and lighting up the Longhorns will still impress the masses.
So what does Griffin need to do tonight to leapfrog ahead of Luck and Richardson? Thatâs projecting that heâs running a close third in this yearâs Heisman race. Most of all, Baylor needs to win. What about a win along with 300 yards passing, 50 yards rushing and 4 touchdowns? How about 400 yards passing, 100 yards rushing and 5 touchdowns but in a loss?
What about 300 yards passing, 50 yards rushing and 4 scores but no highlight reel moment? Would that be enough for Griffin? My take: a win combined with 400 yards of total offense may be enough. The most important number of all, should that occur, will be 9-3: thatâs Baylorâs final record with a victory. That stands out.




3:30 P.M.Houston collapses; B.C.S. picture seems clear


Bob Levey/Getty ImagesCase Keenum and Houston had their hopes of a a perfect season dashed in a 49-28 loss to Southern Mississippi.
Itâs over for Houston. Needing to score on each of its possessions in the fourth quarter, the Cougars are stopped on fourth down in U.S.M. territory, turning the ball back over to the Golden Eagles with less than nine minutes left. Southern Mississippi holds a 42-21 lead.
A disappointing end to an otherwise sterling season. The Cougars entered todayâs game at 12-0, having beat one B.C.S. conference team, U.C.L.A., another conference champion in the WACâs Louisiana Tech and had little trouble rolling through Conference USA play unscathed.
Houston ran into a buzz saw today. Perhaps the rumors about Kevin Sumlinâs future had an adverse on the teamâs preparation. However, Southern Mississippi is in the same boat with its coach, Larry Fedora.
Itâs just a puzzling performance. With so much on the line, how could Houston come out and play its worst game of the 2011 season? With the loss, the Cougars drop from the Sugar Bowl to the Liberty Bowl. Thatâs quite a precipitous slide.
Whatâs next for the B.C.S.? The picture is pretty clear:
L.S.U. and Alabama will meet in the B.C.S. National Championship Game.
In the Rose Bowl, Oregon will meet the winner of Wisconsin and Michigan State.
The Fiesta Bowl will pit Stanford against the winner of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State.
In the Orange Bowl, West Virginia will meet the winner of Clemson and Virginia Tech.
While itâs not official, the Sugar Bowl will likely pit T.C.U. against Michigan. This is the only bowl pairing still contingent on the final B.C.S. standings. Michigan would need to move into the top 14, but should do so with ease. T.C.U. needs to move up two spots, from 18th to 16th, to earn an automatic bid.




3:17 P.M.T.C.U. would get the B.C.S. bid


There is a chance that both T.C.U. and Southern Mississippi, should this lead hold, end the season ranked in the top 16 of the B.C.S. standings. Seeing that both would then be eligible for an automatic bid to a B.C.S. bowl, what is the deciding tiebreaker to determine which team goes to the B.C.S. and which stays home?
Hereâs what a B.C.S. spokesman told me:
âAssuming the teams are ranked higher than the champion of an automatic-qualifying conference, the higher-ranked of the non-(automatic qualifier)-conference teams automatically qualifies, while the other would be eligible for at-large selection.â
In essence, that would put T.C.U. into the Sugar Bowl. Southern Mississippi might make a big jump in the B.C.S. standings, but the Golden Eagles wouldnât leapfrog ahead of the Horned Frogs.




3:13 P.M.Houston needs big plays — and fast


Houston needs every break it can get. Here was one: knocking on Houstonâs door, looking to take a seemingly insurmountable 49-21 lead, Austin Davis fumbles; Houston recovers.
And Keenum and the Cougars back to work, down three touchdowns with 12 minutes left to go. The Cougars can no longer chip away with short passes: Houston needs short, quick-strike drives to get back into this game.
Houstonâs a great second half team. But can the Cougars score 21 unanswered points in 12 minutes merely to force overtime? This is a tall task for any team.




3:00 P.M.Who takes advantage of Houston’s stumble?


Bob Levey/Getty ImagesPhillip Steward fell just short of the goal line on an interception in the third quarter.
Based merely on the first two and a half quarters, it seems as if Houston will not, as most expected, be playing in the Sugar Bowl. Southern Mississippiâs latest touchdown, a 17-yard run by Desmond Johnson, gives the Golden Eagles a 35-21 lead. Scratch that: Southern Mississippiâs latest touchdown, a 61-yard throw and catch from Davis to Tracy Lampley, gives the Golden Eagles a 42-21 lead.
So who would benefit from a Houston loss? Thatâs go off the logic that Houston, currently No. 6 in the B.C.S. standings, drops out off the top 14 in the final standings.
T.C.U. is one who takes advantage. The Horned Frogs, currently No. 18, will get into the B.C.S. through one of two steps: one, they move into the top 14 and get the automatic bid that goes to a non-B.C.S. conference champion that finishes in the top 14. 
Two, they move into the top 16 and get a bid as a non-B.C.S. conference champion with a higher final B.C.S. ranking than the lowest-ranked automatic bid. In this case, that would be Big East champ West Virginia.
Michigan also benefits. To earn an at-large bid, the Wolverines, currently No. 16 in the B.C.S., would need to break into the top 14. Itâs somewhat ironic that a move into the top 14 would come at Houstonâs expense, seeing that the Wolverines and Cougars were projected to meet in the Sugar Bowl.
Could Southern Mississippi take the Conference USA title and Houstonâs B.C.S. spot? Maybe, but that would entail T.C.U. losing to U.N.L.V. this afternoon; not going to happen.




2:40 P.M.A 14-point swing, perhaps


Houston is falling apart at the seams. After an uncharacteristic special teams gaffe allowed Southern Mississippi to take a 28-14, Houstonâs response on offense ends with Case Keenum tossing an interception in the end zone.
Thatâs only Keenumâs fourth interception on the season, not to mention his first season October. Heâs been superb. And to be honest, the interception wasnât necessarily his fault: he was going for his targetâs back shoulder, but it seemed like Keenum and his receiver werenât on the same page.
A touchdown on this drive puts U.S.M. in a great position to cruise to a Conference USA title. But you know what? As Iâm writing this, Houston returns the favor.
Austin Davis has been solid today, throwing three scores with some help from his own receivers and some poor Houston tackling. But he gave the ball right back to U.H., thanks to a pass tipped along the line of scrimmage by Marcus McGraw and intercepted by Phillip Steward.
Steward returned the interception to the U.S.M. four; one play later, Michael Hayes makes the score 28-21. What a turn of events for Houston, which went from licking its wounds after another missed opportunity to a potentially game-changing score.
Could this have been a 14-point swing for the Golden Eagles? A touchdown after Keenumâs interception would have made it a 35-14 game. After Davis threw his pick, Houston draws within a touchdown.




2:29 P.M.His name is Furious Bradley


Yes, his name is Furious Bradley. Furious Bradley is a redshirt freshman cornerback who was suspended for the first four games of 2011 for a violation of team rules.
Furious Bradley just had the trifecta: he blocked Houstonâs punt, recovered the loose ball and ran it in for a touchdown. Furious Bradley. His name is Furious Bradley.
Anyway, Southern Mississippi just put a significant dent in Houstonâs track record of second half excellence. Furious Bradleyâs touchdown gives the Golden Eagles a 28-14 lead; more important, the non-offensive touchdown is something I thought, prior to the game, U.S.M. needed to have a shot at the upset.
Letâs see how Houston responds.




2:10 P.M.Snyder vs. Snyder


Orlin Wagner/Associated PressKansas State defensive back David Garrett defended against Iowa State running back Duran Hollis on Saturday.
In terms of one specific day, the best game Bill Snyder ever coached might have been the 2003 Big 12 title game, when his underdog Wildcats shocked then-undefeated Oklahoma. His best win with Kansas State, however, came in 1998: after years of getting taken behind the woodshed, the Wildcats finally beat Nebraska.
And what has been Snyderâs best coaching job, season-long edition? The contenders include 1991, when Kansas State first broke though; 1993, the programâs first nine-win season since 1910; 1997, its first 11-win season; and any year from 1998-2000 and 2002-3.
I happily put 2011 in for consideration. The difference in talent level between Kansas State and the top tier of the Big 12 has been obvious, and not in Kansas Stateâs favor. The difference in coaching, however, has been firmly tilted in Kansas Stateâs direction all season.
Simply put, there may not be a finer coach in America. There may not be a better coach in college football history, let alone coaching today.
Time and time again, Snyder coaxed a wonderful performance out of a team most, including me, pegged for a seven-win season. Seven wins may be kind; some had projected Kansas State to max out at five wins.
Thereâs a reason you play the games. And thereâs a reason Snyder is a legend: in the history of this game, no one has ever done more with less.




2:05 P.M.Houston’s second half run is coming


Houston might be the best second half team in the country. The Cougars have scored at least 21 points in the second half of 11 of 12 games in 2011, with the season opener against U.C.L.A. the lone exception. Over all, Houston has outscored its opposition by a score of 328-112 in the second half this fall. A closer at the second half score in Houstonâs last 11 games:
North Texas: 28-6
Louisiana Tech: 28-14
Georgia State: 21-0
UTEP: 28-21
East Carolina: 21-0
Marshall: 28-14
Rice: 35-14
U.A.B.: 35-3
Tulane: 38-7
S.M.U.: 24-7
Tulsa: 35-6
Those are the second half scores. Not the entire game, but merely the second half. Houstonâs second half scoring average, 27.3 points per game, would rank 60th in the country. So itâs fitting, I suppose, that Houstonâs 60-minute scoring average, 52.7 points per game, leads the F.B.S.




1:48 P.M.West Virginia’s ticket is nearly punched


West Virginia will be back in the B.C.S. for the first time since Rich Rodriguez was in Morgantown. Itâs not yet official, but itâs hard to see Connecticut overcoming Cincinnatiâs 28-6 lead over the final 30 minutes.
Sending a good team to B.C.S. play helps the Big East. With the B.C.S. reformatting its selection procedures following the 2013 season, it would be helpful for the Big East to win a B.C.S. bowl. Not sending a team to the slaughter, such as in last yearâs Fiesta Bowl, would also be nice.
But thereâs a problem. Itâs a pretty big problem, in fact. A Cincinnati win would send a stronger team to the Orange Bowl. Unfortunately, that team would be West Virginia. 
Hereâs the Big Eastâs conundrum: the Mountaineers would provide a better show, but the program is also embroiled in a fairly acrimonious battle with the league over its future departure for the Big 12.
Imagine a scenario where Cincinnati wins tomorrow, sending W.V.U. to the Orange Bowl. The on-field product is stronger and the TV audience may be a little bigger, which is sweet news to the Big East. 
Later in December, West Virginia announces its intention to join the Big 12 next fall come hell, high water or an exorbitant â millions upon millions of dollars â exit fee from the Big East.
In this scenario, the Mountaineers would kick off the Orange Bowl as a member of the Big East, but would be a member of the Big 12 the second after the final whistle. Awkward. 
In other words, seeing that this scenario will likely come to pass, might the Big East have rather had Louisville go to the Orange Bowl, not West Virginia?
Al Behrman/Associated PressCincinnati receiver Anthony McClung made a reception against Connecticut on Saturday.




1:43 P.M.14 points in the span of one doughnut


In the time it took me to walk 30 yards, pick one doughnut out of a box, eat said doughnut and make small talk with two colleagues, both Houston and Southern Mississippi scored a touchdown.
Put down your remote. Big East football or this? Stick with Conference USA.
Houston tied the game at 14-14 after Keenumâs 50-yard connection with Justin Johnson paved the way for a short Hayes touchdown run.
Southern Mississippi responded with a 3-play, 75-yard drive. After gaining six yards on two plays, Austin Davis hit Dominique Sullivan for a 69-yard touchdown. The Golden Eagles arenât intimidated. Houstonâs quick-strike offense makes no deficit too large.




1:28 P.M.Houston trims Southern Mississippi’s lead


Houston gets on the board. The drive, which spanned 65 yards and took 11 plays, was capped by a nine-yard touchdown catch by Justin Johnson. Southern Mississippiâs lead is cut in half.
Houston got it done through the air: Case Keenum completed all six of his attempts on this drive. More specifically, the Cougars got it done with the screen game.
Keenum found Charles Sims for a 31-yard gain on third down at the U.S.M. 38. He found Sims again for seven yards two plays later. Later, Keenum hit another running back, Michael Hayes, for a nine yard gain to break into the Southern Mississippi red zone.
This short passing game stands in for a traditional running game. But thereâs no replacing a between-the-tackles ground game when it comes to third and short, let alone fourth and short.
On 4th-1 from the U.S.M. 22, Houston called on Hayes to move the chains. No passing here; this was Houston under Bill Yeoman, the programâs longtime coach who is credited with inventing the Veer offense.
Sumlin never thought about a field goal. Good for him. Also, because the comparison is timely, Sumlin is the anti-Mike Sherman. The latter choked up halftime lead after halftime lead. Sumlinâs team excels over the second half.




1:14 P.M.Houston failing in all three facets


Offense, defense and special teams. Houstonâs grades in each facet through 18 minutes: D, D and F, respectively.
The offense has had chances but has not capitalized. The defense has failed to protect the middle of the field. Special teams? Absolutely abysmal, whether punting with the wind or against the wind.
The last punt, even with the wind at Houstonâs back, failed to turn field position back in Houstonâs favor. A personal foul after the Southern Mississippi return cost the Cougars another 15 yards, giving the Golden Eagles possession inside the Houston 40.
Three plays later, Southern Mississippi took a 14-0 lead. Austin Davis has thrown two touchdown passes, the latest to special teams ace Tracy Lampley.
Itâs time for Houston regroup. Remember what got you here, Cougars: offense, defense and special teams. All facets are coming up well short.
And Conference USA starts to sweat. A loss here costs the conference and its 12 teams a significant chunk of change from Houstonâs projected B.C.S. berth.




1:01 P.M.Southern Mississippi 7, Houston 0


Houston heads into the second quarter trailing Southern Mississippi by 7-0, thanks to a touchdown pass from Austin Davis to Ryan Balentine, but the Cougars arenât worried. Houstonâs been here before.
Louisiana Tech held a 20-7 lead at halftime, not to mention a 34-7 lead in the third quarter. UTEP led by 14-0 at the end of the first quarter. Rice led by 17-7 early.
That game against the Owls? That was Case Keenumâs nine-touchdown game. So I donât think the Cougars are biting their fingernails at a 7-0 deficit after 15 minutes. And donât bet on this game maintaining its defense-first feel.




12:51 P.M.Houston leaves points on the field


By my count, Houston has left 14 points on the field. The scoreboard can be deceiving: this is one of those times.
On its first series, Houstonâs Case Keenum had a receiver open down the right sideline on a double move. Keenumâs throw was overthrown by about two yards; close, but just out of reach.
On this most recent series, Keenum hit the wide receiver Tyron Carrier in stride over the deep middle of the field. Carrier, yards ahead of any Southern Mississippi defensive back and with an easy path to the end zone, dropped the pass.
Itâs 0-0. The optimistic U.S.M. fan says that despite some Houston near-misses, the Golden Eagles are in position to take the lead. The pessimistic fan says that U.S.M. has dodged two bullets but has been unable to take advantage of Houstonâs uncharacteristic missteps.




12:43 P.M.Houston as A.P. champs?


During last weekâs game between Arkansas and L.S.U., Gary Danielson of CBS stated that if L.S.U. loses in the B.C.S. title game, the Tigers should still be named the national champion in The Associated Press poll. Danielsonâs logic was simple: L.S.U. would have one loss and Alabama one loss, and each split the yearâs two-game series.
With a win, Alabama would be the B.C.S. national champion. L.S.U. would get the top spot in the A.P. poll as a sort of reward for a perfect regular season.
I can see where Danielson is coming from. But Iâll go one step further: if L.S.U. loses to Alabama on Jan. 9, Iâd promote a 13-0 Houston team for the No. 1 spot in the A.P. poll. That would involve Houston beating Southern Mississippi today and getting past Michigan in the Sugar Bowl; most have pegged Michigan for that B.C.S. at-large bid.
If L.S.U. loses and Houston wins out, wouldnât the Cougars be deserving of being recognized by the A.P. voters? There are 120 teams in the F.B.S. In this scenario, only one, Houston, would be undefeated.




12:33 P.M.Sumlin and Fedora might be gone in days


Houstonâs Kevin Sumlin is probably going to be the next head coach at Texas A&M. Southern Mississippiâs Larry Fedora might be the next head coach at Arizona State, which wanted Sumlin, or Kansas, or Mississippi.
Sumlinâs case is interesting. He wonât be at Houston in 2012, but would he stay on as head coach through January if the Cougars move onto B.C.S. play? Would Fedora, if he gets an offer from Arizona State, stay for a second-tier bowl or pack his bags and leave for Tempe this week?
Another layer: Houston assistants Jason Phillips, the offensive coordinator, and Brian Stewart, the defensive coordinator, may be putting on their own auditions for the permanent job. Phillips is the man behind Houstonâs prolific offense. Stewartâs work on defense has been a major factor behind Houstonâs run to 12-0. 
Phillips has been there longer, but I think Sumlin will do whatever it takes to take Phillips with him to whatever B.C.S. conference school hires him this month.
One thing is sure: Sumlinâs stock will never be higher. Heâs going to strike while the iron is hot. For the former Texas A&M and Oklahoma assistant, the job in College Station should be very, very appealing.




12:23 P.M.The Bill Snyder Show will be delayed


This weekâs episode of the Bill Snyder Show, known in some circle as Kansas State football, will not start on time. Due to storms in Manhattan, Kan., the Wildcatsâ game with Iowa State will begin at approximately 1:10 p.m., not noon.
As David Ubben of ESPN writes, âWord out of Bill Snyder Family Stadium is a 1:10 p.m. local time kickoff, but that’s barring more lightning. The stadium’s already been cleared.â
With a win today, Kansas State can finish with 10 wins for the first time since 2003, when the team was coached by, yes, Bill Snyder.
Iowa State, 6-5, has already clinched bowl eligibility. That give the Cyclones two bowl trip in three years under the former Auburn and Pittsburgh assistant Paul Rhoads, who should be a stronger candidate for major job openings across the country.




12:15 P.M.Big East B.C.S. scenarios


Your up-to-the-minute Big East B.C.S. scenarios:
West Virginia sneaked past South Florida on Friday night to move to 9-3, 5-2 in the Big East.
Louisville beat the Bulls last Friday to move to 7-5, 5-2 in conference play.
Cincinnati hosts Connecticut at noon. The Bearcats enter today at 8-3, 4-2 in the Big East. It should be noted that the Huskies have never won at Cincinnati. It should also be noted that Cincinnati just scored a touchdown in the strangest fashion possible; the Connecticut quarterback Johnny McEntee conceded a safety, but before the whistle blew a Cincinnati defender simply took the ball out of hands. Touchdown, Bearcats.
If Cincinnati wins, leaving three teams tied atop the Big East at 5-2, West Virginia will be named the conference champion and earn an automatic B.C.S. bid to the Orange Bowl. Thatâs because the Mountaineers will have the highest ranking in the final B.C.S. standings.
If Cincinnati loses, Louisville will head to the Orange Bowl thanks to its head-to-head win over West Virginia earlier this month.
Donât bet on Cincinnati losing to Connecticut.
Keith Srakocic/Associated PressPittsburgh’s Tristan Roberts recovered the opening kickoff against Syracuse on Saturday.




11:59 A.M.Getting things started at noon


It seems like just weeks ago that Butch Davis was still coaching at North Carolina. It seems like mere days since L.S.U. ran over Oregon in Dallas on the first Saturday of September. Wasnât it just yesterday that L.S.U. was beating Alabama in overtime?
Time flies. There are 20 games remaining in the 2011 season, minus the 35 bowl games: 19 today, including four conference championship games, and one next Saturday, when Army meets Navy.
Letâs soak it up while thereâs still time. At noon, Case Keenum and Houston host Southern Mississippi for the Conference USA championship. With a win, Houston, then 13-0, heads to the Sugar Bowl. If Southern Mississippi wins, Conference USA loses out on about $8 million of B.C.S. money. Keep your eye out for a questionable flag in the fourth quarter. (Just kidding. Sort of.)
At 4 p.m., Georgia and L.S.U. meet in Atlanta for the SEC championship. More on this game later in the afternoon, but a brief look ahead: sleep on the Georgia defense at your own peril. More later on.
At 8 p.m., Virginia Tech hopes to avenge its lone regular season loss by knocking off Clemson in the A.C.C. Championship Game. Itâs been downhill since October for Clemson, which started 8-0 but lost three of four in November.
Also at 8 p.m., Wisconsin and Michigan State meet for the second time in 2011. You remember October, right? The Spartansâ Kirk Cousins, back to pass, lofting a Hail Mary to the end zone that is first batted down by a U.W. defender and then caught by Michigan Stateâs Keith Nichol. Michigan State 37, Wisconsin 31.
Thatâs not all. Oklahoma and Oklahoma State: Bedlam. Texas and Baylor: Griffin III. And more.


 The roof has caved in on Oklahoma, which seems to have left its game in the locker room, if not back in Norman. Randle just scored again, capping a way-too-easy scoring drive to give Oklahoma State a 24-0 lead. Itâs difficult to imagine a scenario where the Sooners, based on how theyâve played in the first half, can reverse O.S.U.âs momentum a win this game to take home the Big 12 crown. Let the debate begin: Oklahoma State or Alabama as L.S.U.âs partner on Jan. 9 in the B.C.S. National Championship Game? I can see the case for either team. At least the other two games are close. Virginia Tech kicked a field goal late in the first half to tie the A.C.C. championship at 10-10 at halftime. After losing to Clemson in October, Virginia Techâs David Wilson told his team, âTheyâre not better than us.â âAnd I told them we werenât going to lose any more games. And I told them I mean it.â Wilson has been good to his word: since losing to Clemson on Oct. 1, Virginia Tech has rolled off seven straight wins in A.C.C. play. Wisconsin and Michigan State are playing on FOX, which means that broadcast will last until at least midnight. With three minutes left in the first half, Michigan State holds a 22-21 lead. Heâs no longer a Heisman candidate, and yeah, his 2011 season is not as statistically impressive as his 2010 campaign. But Landry Jones remains one of the top three or four quarterbacks in the country, along with his opposite number in Stillwater. And O.S.U. definitely doesnât want him to get in a rhythm. Jones seems to be in the groove on Oklahomaâs latest drive, where the Sooners have gone into a hurry-up mode to solid results. Jones hit on his first four attempts before throwing incomplete, and nearly being intercepted, on his most recent attempt. You know why this sometimes seems like an exercise in futility? Because just as I write about how Jones seems to developing some momentum, Oklahoma State brings the house, sacks Jones, forces a fumble, recovers the fumble and rumbles down to the Oklahoma one-yard line. So for the Sooners, a drive that would have ended in at least three points rapidly turns into a 17-0 deficit. Joseph Randle got the touchdown, his 22nd on the year, to give the Cowboys a commanding lead. Itâs Bedlam in Stillwater. Think Big Ten football is boring? Well, sometimes it is. Then, all of a sudden, itâs not. Take tonightâs Big Ten title game, where it seems as if a Big 12 game has broken out. Wisconsin has had three drives. The first went 71 yards and ended in the touchdown. The second went 60 yards and ended in a touchdown. The third, thanks to a short field, went only 24 yards. It still ended in a touchdown. Michigan State has had two drives: 59 yards and a touchdown, 80 yards and a touchdown. The latter ended with a 30-yard touchdown pass on fourth down by Kirk Cousins, his 22nd touchdown on the season. That tied Drew Stantonâs school record. Thirty-five points. Zero points. Little more than a quarter in the books. The Big Ten isnât boring tonight. Ouch. According to Greg Wallace of the Anderson (S.C.) Independent-Mail, power seems to be out in Clemson, home of the Tigers, and may be out until midnight. So you know that game the entire area cares about? You know, the A.C.C. Championship Game? No dice. I guess fans in Clemson can follow on the Internet, however. What? The Internet wonât work without power? Oh. Ouch. Montee Ball scored four times against U.N.L.V. He scored twice against Oregon State, Northern Illinois and South Dakota. He scored four times against Nebraska, three times against Indiana. He scored twice against Michigan State and Ohio State. He scored three times against Purdue, Minnesota and Illinois. Ball scored four times against Penn State. Heâs already scored twice tonight, helping give Wisconsin a 21-7 lead over Michigan State. Oh, and Ballâs completed a 32-yard pass to Russell Wilson, helping set up his first touchdown. Add those up yet? In all, Ball has scored 36 touchdowns, three fewer than the N.C.A.A. single-season record held by Barry Sanders. He probably should get an invite to Manhattan for the Heisman Trophy ceremony, right? More great stuff from ESPNâs Big 12 blogger David Ubben, who writes of Oklahomaâs game of musical chairs in the secondary: âOklahoma tried Javon Harris. Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III and receiver Kendall Wright made it obvious that wasn’t going to work. Apparently, neither will experienced senior Sam Proctor. Oklahoma’s Tony Jefferson, who most often plays a nickel back position, is playing deep safety, something Bob Stoops has said a handful of times he has no intention of doing. Joseph Ibiloye replaced Jefferson underneath at the nickel back.â Basically, itâs not a good time to be trying out news things in the secondary, not when Brandon Weeden, Justin Blackmon and the Cowboys feature the second-most prolific passing game in the country. Can O.U. slow down Oklahoma State? And when push comes to shove, can any defensive back on the roster hang with Blackmon? If not, the Sooners will need to devote multiple backs to hanging with the all-American. And thatâs where O.S.U. gets you. There are points on the board in each of tonightâs three key games. Oklahoma State struck first against Oklahoma. It was a four-play drive highlighted by a 53-yard completion from the quarterback Brandon Weeden to Tracy Moore, with the latter doing most of the work on his catch-and-run jaunt down the left sideline. Jeremy Smith scored from nine yards out to give O.S.U. a 7-0 lead. The Cowboys have found Oklahomaâs weakness: the pass. Of course, Oklahoma State passes on anyone, anytime, anywhere. But can the Cowboys pass on L.S.U.? After an awful November, Tajh Boydâs December is off to a good start. Heâs completed five of his first six attempts against Virginia Tech, including a 24-yard strike to Dwayne Allen to take a 7-0 lead. In my mind, Allen is the best tight end in college football. And in Indianapolis, Wisconsinâs touchdown is matched on the ensuing drive by Michigan State. Itâs tied, 7-7. Surprise! Wisconsinâs touchdown was not scored by the running back Montee Ball. Fresno State has been the most disappointing non-B.C.S. conference team in the country. That Boise State lost one game isnât a disappointment; itâs upsetting, but to call the Broncos a disappointment would ignore the fact that you, if youâre like most fans, were rooting for the Broncos to lose all season. Fresno Stateâs disappointing season will mercifully come to a close tonight, when the Bulldogs travel to San Diego State to cap a 13-game regular season. The added game might give Fresno nine losses, something the program hasnât done since 1973. It wasnât supposed to be like this. The Bulldogs opened September with two fairly competitive losses to California and Nebraska. That was followed by two wins and another loss to Mississippi; that loss wasnât good, but it did come against a B.C.S. conference opponent. Fresno showed its true colors in a 57-7 loss to Boise State on Oct. 7: quite simply, the Bulldogs quit. This was a team most had pegged as a leading contender for a depleted WAC. If Fresno was ever going to win it, thought most, it would be now. Since Fresno is Mountain West-bound in 2012, that elusive WAC crown, something the Bulldogs havenât taken home since 1999, is never going to happen. Itâs 8 p.m. on the East Coast, so we can all finally turn the page on L.S.U.âs laugher against Georgia and turn our attention to three games with B.C.S. implications. Despite losing in East Lansing in October, Wisconsin is favored in tonightâs Big Ten Championship Game. The Badgers followed that loss, which came on a Hail Mary pass from Kirk Cousins to Keith Nichol, with another painful loss to Ohio State. But since the matching losses in East Lansing and Columbus, Wisconsin has picked up right where it left off. The Badgers made it look easy through mid-October, not breaking a sweat against four also-rans in September before dispatching with Nebraska and Indiana by a combined score of 107-24. It was more of the same in November, minus a puzzlingly close win at Illinois two weeks ago. Any question that the Badgers were not the team we saw through Oct. 15 was answered last Saturday: Badgers 45, Penn State 7. Wisconsin could have picked the final score. Only four teams have gained more than 300 yards against the Badgers this fall: Nebraska, Michigan State, Ohio State and Illinois. Only three teams, the same list minus Illinois, averaged more than five yards per play against the Badgers. In 2010, for example, six opponents averaged more than six yards per play. Despite losing two games in the regular season, could this yearâs Badgers be better than the 2010 team that played in the Rose Bowl? Itâs hard to say otherwise, especially seeing the way Wisconsin has buttoned up last yearâs occasionally leaky defense. And yet it was this defense, on back-to-back weeks, that sprung a leak with a game in the balance. Michigan State gained 399 yards of total offense; 44 came on the gameâs final play. The Buckeyes gained 357 yards; 40 came on their final offensive play. Even with a win tonight in Indianapolis, could Wisconsinâs season be defined by the games it let get away? Better yet, can the Badgers take any solace, even if the year ends at 12-2, in the knowledge that they may be the best team in program history? Simply more of the same from L.S.U., which has turned in a similar script from its win over Arkansas last Friday. Against the Razorbacks, the Tigers fell down by 14-0 before winning by 41-17. Today, the Tigers fell down by 10 points in the first half but have now scored 42 unanswered points. The question isnât whether L.S.U. is the best team in the country. This is obvious. Hereâs the question: Can anyone beat L.S.U.? How do you beat L.S.U.? Show a tendency to pass first, as Georgia did today, and the Tigers will send the house and disrupt your passing game. Show a tendency to run and, well, itâs not going to work. You canât run on L.S.U. for 60 minutes. Can Oklahoma State beat L.S.U.? Can Alabama? Can anyone beat L.S.U.? And should how a team would fare against the Tigers be the tiebreaker for voters still hedging over whether to put the Cowboys, should they win tonight, or Crimson Tide No. 2 in the final regular season poll? How bad is Middle Tennessee State? Before getting to that, a word on the North Texas running back Lance Dunbar, who entered todayâs game against the Blue Raiders needing 140 yards to break the former U.N.T. star Patrick Cobbsâ school and Sun Belt Conference record. Dunbar ended his day with 313 yards, giving him the two records and an F.B.S. high in 2011. North Texas won by 59-7, underlining how well the Mean Green played in their first season under Dan McCarney and how poorly Middle Tennessee, 2-10, played in its sixth season under Rick Stockstill. The two wins came over Memphis and Florida Atlantic, two teams right alongside M.T.S.U. among the bottom five teams in the country. The 10 defeats included a six-game losing streak to end the season. It was a streak to forget: Middle Tennessee lost to Louisiana-Lafayette, Tennessee, Louisiana-Monroe, Arkansas State, Florida International and North Texas by the combined score of 246-78. I think Middle Tennessee State needs to think long and hard about the programâs future under Stockstill. Heâs had some unfortunate hires at offensive coordinator that has stymied his teamâs production over the last few years, but the buck stops at his desk. L.S.U. just capped a 70-yard scoring drive, more than doubling its yardage output for the game. Prior to the possession, which ended with a Kenny Hilliard touchdown, the Tigers had 50 yards of total offense. Hilliard, by the way, just tied an SEC Championship Game record with three touchdowns. So this one is over. L.S.U. leads by 28-10; Georgia has no chance, absolutely zero chance, of coming back and winning this game. If the Bulldogs donât show some fortitude defensively the score may get out of hand. So letâs look ahead to tonight. There are three conference title games kicking off at 8 p.m., though only two carry that official title. Oklahomaâs date with Oklahoma State isnât an âofficialâ Big 12 championship game, but the winner of that game earns the leagueâs automatic bid to the Fiesta Bowl. Clemson and Virginia Tech meet for the second time. In October, the Tigers put the clamps down on David Wilson and the Hokies for a 23-3 win. The Hokies havenât lost since. The Tigers lost three of four in November. In another regular season rematch, Wisconsin and Michigan State meet in the inaugural Big Ten title game with a Rose Bowl berth on the line. Asked yesterday about any perceived lack of interest in this rematch, Bret Beliema replied, âAnyone who watched our first game, if you donât want a sequel to that…” B.Y.U. is 8-3, but itâs not like the Cougars are running through the SEC. Well, the Cougars did get past one SEC team, Mississippi, but only by a single point. Nothing to write home about, in other words. But in all, only one of B.Y.U.âs wins, Utah State, has come against a team with more than four wins. The Cougars have as many wins against bowl eligible teams as F.C.S. teams. It hasnât really been the year the program may have planned in its first season as an F.B.S. Independent. What did the Cougars expect? What did I expect? I thought B.Y.U. would go 10-2; 9-3, with a win over Hawaii tonight, isnât that much worse, but the Cougars have lost to the only three teams of consequence on the schedule.Â Texas sneaked past by a single point. Utah blew their doors off. T.C.U. had more than enough in the tank for a 38-28 win. The wins have come over the Rebels, the Aggies, U.C.F., San Jose State, Oregon State, Idaho State, Idaho and New Mexico State. But there have been positive signs. The offense took a giant step forward once Riley Nelson replaced Jake Heaps at quarterback. That Heaps played well in Nelsonâs stead while the latter deals with an injury is a great sign for his still-promising future. The defense has improved significantly over the last two months. But yes, the improvement does coincide with the easing up of the schedule. Itâs the toughest thing for a freshman running back to learn: pass protection? Who do I block? Do I start inside and work out or vice versa? Go high or low? Georgiaâs Isaiah Crowell was the nationâs top running back recruit coming out of high school in February, perhaps the programâs most highly-touted prospect at the position since â gasp â Herschel Walker. Heâs shown the sort of speed, agility and shiftiness befitting his five-star status. But Crowellâs work in pass protection still leaves much to be desired, as illustrated by several blown assignments during the third quarter. As a whole, Georgiaâs inability to combat the L.S.U. pass rush is a major impediment to the Bulldogsâ attempted comeback from this 21-10 deficit. After keeping Aaron Murray clean for much of the first half, the Bulldogs have become the hunted, not the hunter. I canât imagine a scenario where Georgia comes back and wins this game. And yes, I know thereâs plenty of game to be played. But the L.S.U. defense is loaded with sharks, and thereâs blood in the water. Remember Robert Griffin IIIâs line at halftime? He was 6 of 11 for 161 yards and 2 scores, one passing and one rushing. Now, with seven minutes left in the fourth quarter, Griffin is 15 of 22 for 320 yards and 4 scores, two through the air and two on the ground. And Baylor is taking Texas to school, 48-24, meaning Baylorâs going to finish the regular season 9-3. Is there any reason why Griffin shouldnât win the Heisman? And what about Mathieu? Thereâs really no way to describe his most recent punt return. Letâs just say that if it had continued all the way to the end zone, he might have been the Heisman frontrunner. By the way, L.S.U. is doing its usual thing to Georgia. Mathieuâs long, winding punt return (Georgia should just kick it out of bounds, by the way) has the Tigers on the doorstep once again, a play or two away from taking a 21-10 lead. If it gets to 21-10, we can put this game to bed. So much more three SEC teams in the B.C.S. Of all the things Georgia couldnât afford to do coming out of halftime, Iâd say fumbling on its third play from scrimmage ranks at the top of list. Though fumbling on its first play would have been worse, I suppose. Aaron Murray, fighting for a first down on third and long, had the ball stripped away by a pair of L.S.U. defenders at his own 26-yard line. The fumble was recovered by Tyrann Mathieu, of course. Two plays later, L.S.U. takes its first lead of the game. After Jordan Jefferson found Reuben Randle for the first L.S.U. first down of the game, the running back Kenny Hilliard rumbled into the end zone from 15 yards out to make it a 14-10 score. Georgia couldnât have scripted it any worse. L.S.U. couldnât have asked for a better start. Now that the Tigers have the lead, can Georgia rebound? This game seems a lot like L.S.U.âs win over Arkansas, does it not? Itâs halftime at the Georgia Dome, which means one thing: itâs time for the Dr. Pepper tuition giveaway thingamajig, where two contestants try to throw football into oversized soda cans to win $100,000 to help pay for college. The winner, one Ms. Padilla-Rodriguez, went with the chest-pass route. Not pretty, but hey, whatever works. There is no truth to the rumor that Ms. Padilla-Rodriguez signed her Dr. Pepper check before using the same pen to sign a Letter of Intent to play quarterback at L.S.U. in the second half. L.S.U. almost had a first down. Almost, almost, almost. Ignore that it would have come via a roughing the kicker penalty on Georgia. Instead, the call was running into the kicker, a five-yard penalty that still forced the Tigers into another punt. At the half, Georgia has 133 yards of total offense. L.S.U. has 12 yard of total offense. L.S.U. has zero first downs. Not a one. Georgiaâs offense slowed down over the second half of the second quarter, but the Bulldogs have tasted some success through the air. The Tigersâ M.V.P. is clearly the punter Brad Wing. He was also the undisputed M.V.P. of Novemberâs win over Alabama, by the way. Mathieu has the big play, but Wingâs punt to end the previous series, which put Georgia deep in its own territory, set up Mathieuâs return. So, to recap: L.S.U. has zero first downs and trails by only three points. I can see it now: one half of the B.C.S. National Championship Game loses in its conference title game without getting a first down. And in the title game, meets an Alabama team that didnât win its own division. L.S.U. has more punt returns for touchdowns as first downs. One, zero. I canât say enough about the Georgia front seven, which has dominated the line of scrimmage throughout the first half. A special tip of the hat goes to the former junior college transfer John Jenkins, a mountain-sized nose tackle who has stepped up his game over the last six weeks. It took Jenkins a few weeks to get acclimated to the college game, in part because he was not where he needed to be in terms of his conditioning. Now? Heâs a handful. L.S.U. has been unable to keep him under wraps. Georgia, which gets the ball to start the second half, is playing it conservatively on offense with less than two minutes left in the half. L.S.U. is calling its own timeouts to get the ball back with a shot at scoring before heading into the locker room. Strange sight on review: Did Mathieu flip the ball to the sideline referee before crossing the goal line on his touchdown return? It seems that he did, going off a slow-motion replay from the CBS broadcast. Thereâs your game-changing play. The L.S.U. cornerback Tyran Mathieu, perhaps the nationâs most electrifying player, returned Drew Butlerâs punt 62 yards for a touchdown to cut Georgiaâs lead to 10-7. Mathieu is incredible. Heâs on a whole other level. No other player in college football has flashed the same sort of big-play ability. Against Oregon, his fumble recovery of a muffed punt was the turning point in L.S.U.âs big win. He returned another fumble for a touchdown against Kentucky. Heâs a tackling machine despite his smaller stature. Mathieu has a nose for the football, where on defense or special teams.  And the numbers donât tell the whole story. If not for his midseason suspension for a violation of team rules, I think Mathieu had as strong a case for the Heisman as another recent dominant defender, Nebraskaâs Ndamukong Suh. L.S.U. has gone three-and-out on each of its five possessions. Remember what I said about Georgiaâs defense? L.S.U.âs missteps have come because of Georgiaâs ability to put the clamps down defensively. Georgiaâs wounds on offense have been nearly entirely self-inflicted. Murray missed King in the end zone on the first series, leading to a field goal. Later, Mitchell dropped a touchdown. Itâs 10-0; it could be 17-0, if not worse. Why is this important? Because just eight days ago, Arkansas held a 14-0 second quarter lead against L.S.U. only to lose by 24 points, 41-17. You need to take advantage of any and all opportunities against the Tigers. L.S.U. is confident that eventually, the tide will turn in its favor. Georgia needs to create some more breathing room before the Tigers make their inevitable run. A win is the biggest thing for Robert Griffin III, as noted earlier. A victory would make Baylor 9-3 and very much in play for a B.C.S. berth. If Griffin leads the Bears to a B.C.S. bowl, well, he should win the Heisman. He hasnât played great against Texas, however. He started by completing his second pass to Kendall Wright for a 59-yard touchdown. Over all, heâs completed 6 of 11 attempts for 161 yards with that touchdown and an interception along with nine yards on eight carries. Either Griffin needs to have a stronger second half or he needs to keep Baylor on path for 9-3. At the half, the Bears lead Texas by 24-21. It seems as if this game will come down to one factor: L.S.U.âs ability to get pressure on Aaron Murray. Given time, Georgiaâs sophomore quarterback is seemingly doing the impossible. Heâs having success against the L.S.U. secondary. Murray is 7 of 15 for 99 yards and a touchdown, the latter to the tight end Aron White to give the Bulldogs a 10-0 lead. In all, Georgia has 133 yards of total offense; L.S.U. has 11. So far, this game is playing right into Georgiaâs hands. The Tigers will find it very difficult to work their way back into this game offensively if they become one-dimensional. Georgiaâs pass rush is ferocious enough to make life very difficult for Jordan Jefferson should he be placed in clear passing downs. At the end of one quarter: Georgia 10, L.S.U. 0. Run, pass, sack, punt. Run, pass, run, punt. Pass, run, pass, punt. Through 12 minutes, itâs the Georgia defense thatâs dominating this game, not its opposite number from Baton Rouge. L.S.U. has had the ball three times, run nine plays and punted three times. Georgia, thanks in part to an onside kick recovery, has controlled the ball and field position. Unfortunately, the Bulldogs have only three points to show for it. You could make the case that each of the Bulldogsâ first two possessions should have ended with a touchdown: Murray missed King and Mitchell dropped a sure score. Georgia is getting it done along the line of scrimmage. Offensively, the Bulldogsâ front is opening up holes in the running game; this is surprising, given how weâve acclaimed L.S.U.âs front seven as the nationâs best. Defensively, Georgiaâs 3-4 look is giving L.S.U. fits. The Bulldogs are huge up front, very N.F.L.-like, and tough to move off the ball. If Georgia can continue to win on first down itâll be very difficult for the Tigers to move the ball. Murray just found Orson Charles, one of the nationâs best tight ends, for a big third down conversion. The Bulldogs are back inside the L.S.U. red zone. Can they get six, not settle for a field goal try? If Arkansas State beats Troy this afternoon, giving the Red Wolves a 10-2 record, Hugh Freeze will have made $20,216 per win in 2011. In comparison, Mississippi will have paid Houston Nutt $1.4 million per win in 2011. Not surprisingly, Nutt wonât be returning to Oxford in 2012. Freeze is the lowest-paid coach in America, according to USA Todayâs database of salaries, which does not contain contract details for those coaches working at private universities. So you can see why Freeze has become such a coaching commodity as Arkansas State wraps up its regular season; you can also see why Mississippi, where Freeze was once an assistant, is interested in his services. Where could he land in 2012? If he goes to any major school, Iâd put the Rebels as a heavy favorite. But donât rule out the potential for Freeze to make a slight jump up the coaching ladder by moving to Southern Mississippi, should Larry Fedora be hired by a Kansas or Arizona State. That would be painful for Arkansas State, but the Southern Mississippi job would represent a step up for Freeze. Should he win in Hattiesburg, Freeze might become even more popular than he is today. Though that hardly seems possible. And considering the mutual interest with Mississippi, do you think Freeze, whose team just kicked off against Troy, might ask for a tape of this SEC title game? You know, just to get a head start on 2012. Maybe. Mark Richtâs not necessarily a gambler. Other coaches in the SEC, such as his counterpart on the opposite sideline, Les Miles, are better known for taking chances. He rolled the dice after Georgiaâs field goal, however. Taking L.S.U. completely off guard, Richt dialed up an onside kick; it was recovered by the safety Alec Ogletree. Unfortunately, this drive ends in a missed field goal. Walsh missed a 45-yard try, pushing it right to keep this a 3-0 game. On the play before, however, Georgia botched another golden opportunity. First: Georgiaâs drive received a huge boost from a holding call on the L.S.U. cornerback Morris Claiborne on a third down play after the drive seemed doomed at 2nd-19.  The Bulldogs got 18 yards on a Murray pass to the tight end Orson Charles, setting up a short third down conversion. Instead of pounding away at the L.S.U. defensive front, Georgia went play-action: Murray tucked it away, rolled to his right and threw to his receiver, who was held by Claiborne after making a break towards the end zone. Still, Georgia is missing on some gift-wrapped touchdowns. On the first series, Murray missed on an open King in the end zone. This drive? My goodness. The freshman receiver Malcolm Mitchell, who leads the team in receiving yards despite missing three games, dropped a sure-fire touchdown along the right sideline on the play prior to Walshâs missed field goal. The pass hit Mitchell right in the stomach. An inexcusable drop. Mitchell could have skipped into the end zone. A 3-0 lead is fine. A 10-0 lead would have been enormous for the Bulldogs. Georgia strikes first. After L.S.Uâs first drive ended in a punt, Blair Walsh hits a 40-yard field goal to give the Bulldogs a 3-0 lead. The big play was a 44-yard connection between Aaron Murray and Tavarres King, who was freed by a Murray pump fake that seemed to freeze the L.S.U. safeties. Georgia didnât pass once: five plays, five passes. And on third down from the L.S.U. 22, Murray had an open King running a post route into the end zone but misfired. It could be 7-0, but Georgia should be happy with 3-0. L.S.U. will button things up in the secondary. Itâs now back on the Georgia defense to get stop on first down and pressure on third down. One factor heavily in Georgiaâs favor is the home field. The SEC title game is being played at the Georgia Dome, right in the Bulldogsâ backyard in Atlanta, and the crowd will be heavily pro-Georgia. And thatâs not solely because of the schoolâs close proximity to Atlanta. It stands to reason that since L.S.U. is heading to New Orleans on Jan. 9, many fans might save the cost of traveling to Atlanta, buying a ticket and paying for lodging when theyâd rather go to the title game rematch against Alabama. If this game is close in the fourth quarter, could the pro-Georgia crowd give the Bulldogs a lift? L.S.U. is going to the B.C.S. championship game either way. Win or lose, weâre looking at a rematch of the Nov. 5 game in Tuscaloosa, when the Tigers beat Alabama with a field goal in overtime. This game still holds tremendous meaning to Georgia, winners of 10 straight after an 0-2 start that had many calling this season Mark Richtâs last with the program. Not even close: Richt is my pick for SEC Coach of the Year. Can the Bulldogs score the upset? Absolutely. And if they do, itâll be on the back of a defense thatâs as good, mean, nasty, physical and opportunistic as any group in the country. Georgia allowed 77 points to Boise State and South Carolina during its 0-2 start. Georgiaâs next five opponents combined for 83 points.Â Georgiaâs last five opponents have combined for 70 points. The story has been this defense, which has gone from stressful to stingy since South Carolina. Hereâs how Georgia beats you on defense: size up front, speed on the edge, a nose for the ball along the back. Georgia throttles you with a time-honored blueprint, one youâll see in action this afternoon against L.S.U. Be physical at the point of attack. This goes for defensive linemen and cornerbacks alike. Confuse protection. This, the ability to disguise, is one of the beauties of Todd Granthamâs 3-4 system. Get mean. And what does L.S.U. have on defense that Georgia doesnât? Name value. Depth, especially along the defensive line. Cockiness â that the Tigers have in spades. Meanness? Thatâs a shared trait. Ability to stop the run? Also shared. Rush the quarterback? Shut things down in the secondary? Shared and shared. The point is this: Georgia can win this game. Would it come with beauty points? Nope. Beauty has left the building, replaced by two nasty, talented defenses. Utah State clinched a bowl berth by beating Nevada, 21-17, last Saturday. The victory was Utah Stateâs fourth straight, all coming by a touchdown or less, which carries enormous meaning for the program: for starters, the Aggies, prior to this fall, hadnât won more than four games in a season since 2000. Two days after the victory, on Monday, Utah State accepted a bid to the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl â a real bowl game â on Dec. 17. All in all, this season, Gary Andersenâs third with the program, has been Utah Stateâs most successful year in a generation. So why are you left wondering what could have been? Because Utah State, which just kicked off against New Mexico State, could be 8-3. Or 9-2. Or 10-1. While November found the Aggies coming out on the winning end of hard-fought, narrowly-decided games, the Aggies left points, and opportunities, on the board in September and October. The Aggies led Auburn 10 points with roughly two minutes to go but lost. It was a similar story against Colorado State, B.Y.U. and Louisiana Tech. Each came in September and October.Â These losses, especially over such a short span of time, can test a team. They will most certainly test a fan base, even one like Utah Stateâs, a fan base more accustomed to defeat than victory. A win over Louisiana Tech might have given the Aggies the WAC title. A win over Auburn would have the programâs best since leaving the Big West Conference in 2000. A win over B.Y.U. might have given Utah State its second Beehive Boot, something it hasnât done since 1971-74. What could have been.Â  The silver lining, of course, is that the Aggies have rebounded. And the Aggies have bounced back in a satisfying â but still palpitation-inducing â fashion, winning those four straight games by a combined 16 points. Is this a turning point for the program? So Andrew Luck wonât play again until January. His regular season, unfortunately, is over. The same goes for Trent Richardson, who ended his regular season by romping all over Auburn in last weekendâs Iron Bowl. One of the three Heisman leaders has one final bullet in his gun, however. Robert Griffin III has one more game with which to make his case, and fortunately for Griffin, itâs against Texas. Say what you will about the Longhorns, who have improved over 2010 but remain a work-in-progress: Texas is still Texas, and lighting up the Longhorns will still impress the masses. So what does Griffin need to do tonight to leapfrog ahead of Luck and Richardson? Thatâs projecting that heâs running a close third in this yearâs Heisman race. Most of all, Baylor needs to win. What about a win along with 300 yards passing, 50 yards rushing and 4 touchdowns? How about 400 yards passing, 100 yards rushing and 5 touchdowns but in a loss? What about 300 yards passing, 50 yards rushing and 4 scores but no highlight reel moment? Would that be enough for Griffin? My take: a win combined with 400 yards of total offense may be enough. The most important number of all, should that occur, will be 9-3: thatâs Baylorâs final record with a victory. That stands out. Itâs over for Houston. Needing to score on each of its possessions in the fourth quarter, the Cougars are stopped on fourth down in U.S.M. territory, turning the ball back over to the Golden Eagles with less than nine minutes left. Southern Mississippi holds a 42-21 lead. A disappointing end to an otherwise sterling season. The Cougars entered todayâs game at 12-0, having beat one B.C.S. conference team, U.C.L.A., another conference champion in the WACâs Louisiana Tech and had little trouble rolling through Conference USA play unscathed. Houston ran into a buzz saw today. Perhaps the rumors about Kevin Sumlinâs future had an adverse on the teamâs preparation. However, Southern Mississippi is in the same boat with its coach, Larry Fedora. Itâs just a puzzling performance. With so much on the line, how could Houston come out and play its worst game of the 2011 season? With the loss, the Cougars drop from the Sugar Bowl to the Liberty Bowl. Thatâs quite a precipitous slide. Whatâs next for the B.C.S.? The picture is pretty clear: L.S.U. and Alabama will meet in the B.C.S. National Championship Game. In the Rose Bowl, Oregon will meet the winner of Wisconsin and Michigan State. The Fiesta Bowl will pit Stanford against the winner of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State. In the Orange Bowl, West Virginia will meet the winner of Clemson and Virginia Tech. While itâs not official, the Sugar Bowl will likely pit T.C.U. against Michigan. This is the only bowl pairing still contingent on the final B.C.S. standings. Michigan would need to move into the top 14, but should do so with ease. T.C.U. needs to move up two spots, from 18th to 16th, to earn an automatic bid. There is a chance that both T.C.U. and Southern Mississippi, should this lead hold, end the season ranked in the top 16 of the B.C.S. standings. Seeing that both would then be eligible for an automatic bid to a B.C.S. bowl, what is the deciding tiebreaker to determine which team goes to the B.C.S. and which stays home? Hereâs what a B.C.S. spokesman told me: âAssuming the teams are ranked higher than the champion of an automatic-qualifying conference, the higher-ranked of the non-(automatic qualifier)-conference teams automatically qualifies, while the other would be eligible for at-large selection.â In essence, that would put T.C.U. into the Sugar Bowl. Southern Mississippi might make a big jump in the B.C.S. standings, but the Golden Eagles wouldnât leapfrog ahead of the Horned Frogs. Houston needs every break it can get. Here was one: knocking on Houstonâs door, looking to take a seemingly insurmountable 49-21 lead, Austin Davis fumbles; Houston recovers. And Keenum and the Cougars back to work, down three touchdowns with 12 minutes left to go. The Cougars can no longer chip away with short passes: Houston needs short, quick-strike drives to get back into this game. Houstonâs a great second half team. But can the Cougars score 21 unanswered points in 12 minutes merely to force overtime? This is a tall task for any team. Based merely on the first two and a half quarters, it seems as if Houston will not, as most expected, be playing in the Sugar Bowl. Southern Mississippiâs latest touchdown, a 17-yard run by Desmond Johnson, gives the Golden Eagles a 35-21 lead. Scratch that: Southern Mississippiâs latest touchdown, a 61-yard throw and catch from Davis to Tracy Lampley, gives the Golden Eagles a 42-21 lead. So who would benefit from a Houston loss? Thatâs go off the logic that Houston, currently No. 6 in the B.C.S. standings, drops out off the top 14 in the final standings. T.C.U. is one who takes advantage. The Horned Frogs, currently No. 18, will get into the B.C.S. through one of two steps: one, they move into the top 14 and get the automatic bid that goes to a non-B.C.S. conference champion that finishes in the top 14.  Two, they move into the top 16 and get a bid as a non-B.C.S. conference champion with a higher final B.C.S. ranking than the lowest-ranked automatic bid. In this case, that would be Big East champ West Virginia. Michigan also benefits. To earn an at-large bid, the Wolverines, currently No. 16 in the B.C.S., would need to break into the top 14. Itâs somewhat ironic that a move into the top 14 would come at Houstonâs expense, seeing that the Wolverines and Cougars were projected to meet in the Sugar Bowl. Could Southern Mississippi take the Conference USA title and Houstonâs B.C.S. spot? Maybe, but that would entail T.C.U. losing to U.N.L.V. this afternoon; not going to happen. Houston is falling apart at the seams. After an uncharacteristic special teams gaffe allowed Southern Mississippi to take a 28-14, Houstonâs response on offense ends with Case Keenum tossing an interception in the end zone. Thatâs only Keenumâs fourth interception on the season, not to mention his first season October. Heâs been superb. And to be honest, the interception wasnât necessarily his fault: he was going for his targetâs back shoulder, but it seemed like Keenum and his receiver werenât on the same page. A touchdown on this drive puts U.S.M. in a great position to cruise to a Conference USA title. But you know what? As Iâm writing this, Houston returns the favor. Austin Davis has been solid today, throwing three scores with some help from his own receivers and some poor Houston tackling. But he gave the ball right back to U.H., thanks to a pass tipped along the line of scrimmage by Marcus McGraw and intercepted by Phillip Steward. Steward returned the interception to the U.S.M. four; one play later, Michael Hayes makes the score 28-21. What a turn of events for Houston, which went from licking its wounds after another missed opportunity to a potentially game-changing score. Could this have been a 14-point swing for the Golden Eagles? A touchdown after Keenumâs interception would have made it a 35-14 game. After Davis threw his pick, Houston draws within a touchdown. Yes, his name is Furious Bradley. Furious Bradley is a redshirt freshman cornerback who was suspended for the first four games of 2011 for a violation of team rules. Furious Bradley just had the trifecta: he blocked Houstonâs punt, recovered the loose ball and ran it in for a touchdown. Furious Bradley. His name is Furious Bradley. Anyway, Southern Mississippi just put a significant dent in Houstonâs track record of second half excellence. Furious Bradleyâs touchdown gives the Golden Eagles a 28-14 lead; more important, the non-offensive touchdown is something I thought, prior to the game, U.S.M. needed to have a shot at the upset. Letâs see how Houston responds. In terms of one specific day, the best game Bill Snyder ever coached might have been the 2003 Big 12 title game, when his underdog Wildcats shocked then-undefeated Oklahoma. His best win with Kansas State, however, came in 1998: after years of getting taken behind the woodshed, the Wildcats finally beat Nebraska. And what has been Snyderâs best coaching job, season-long edition? The contenders include 1991, when Kansas State first broke though; 1993, the programâs first nine-win season since 1910; 1997, its first 11-win season; and any year from 1998-2000 and 2002-3. I happily put 2011 in for consideration. The difference in talent level between Kansas State and the top tier of the Big 12 has been obvious, and not in Kansas Stateâs favor. The difference in coaching, however, has been firmly tilted in Kansas Stateâs direction all season. Simply put, there may not be a finer coach in America. There may not be a better coach in college football history, let alone coaching today. Time and time again, Snyder coaxed a wonderful performance out of a team most, including me, pegged for a seven-win season. Seven wins may be kind; some had projected Kansas State to max out at five wins. Thereâs a reason you play the games. And thereâs a reason Snyder is a legend: in the history of this game, no one has ever done more with less. Houston might be the best second half team in the country. The Cougars have scored at least 21 points in the second half of 11 of 12 games in 2011, with the season opener against U.C.L.A. the lone exception. Over all, Houston has outscored its opposition by a score of 328-112 in the second half this fall. A closer at the second half score in Houstonâs last 11 games: North Texas: 28-6
Louisiana Tech: 28-14
Georgia State: 21-0
UTEP: 28-21
East Carolina: 21-0
Marshall: 28-14
Rice: 35-14
U.A.B.: 35-3
Tulane: 38-7
S.M.U.: 24-7
Tulsa: 35-6 Those are the second half scores. Not the entire game, but merely the second half. Houstonâs second half scoring average, 27.3 points per game, would rank 60th in the country. So itâs fitting, I suppose, that Houstonâs 60-minute scoring average, 52.7 points per game, leads the F.B.S. West Virginia will be back in the B.C.S. for the first time since Rich Rodriguez was in Morgantown. Itâs not yet official, but itâs hard to see Connecticut overcoming Cincinnatiâs 28-6 lead over the final 30 minutes. Sending a good team to B.C.S. play helps the Big East. With the B.C.S. reformatting its selection procedures following the 2013 season, it would be helpful for the Big East to win a B.C.S. bowl. Not sending a team to the slaughter, such as in last yearâs Fiesta Bowl, would also be nice. But thereâs a problem. Itâs a pretty big problem, in fact. A Cincinnati win would send a stronger team to the Orange Bowl. Unfortunately, that team would be West Virginia.  Hereâs the Big Eastâs conundrum: the Mountaineers would provide a better show, but the program is also embroiled in a fairly acrimonious battle with the league over its future departure for the Big 12. Imagine a scenario where Cincinnati wins tomorrow, sending W.V.U. to the Orange Bowl. The on-field product is stronger and the TV audience may be a little bigger, which is sweet news to the Big East.  Later in December, West Virginia announces its intention to join the Big 12 next fall come hell, high water or an exorbitant â millions upon millions of dollars â exit fee from the Big East. In this scenario, the Mountaineers would kick off the Orange Bowl as a member of the Big East, but would be a member of the Big 12 the second after the final whistle. Awkward.  In other words, seeing that this scenario will likely come to pass, might the Big East have rather had Louisville go to the Orange Bowl, not West Virginia? In the time it took me to walk 30 yards, pick one doughnut out of a box, eat said doughnut and make small talk with two colleagues, both Houston and Southern Mississippi scored a touchdown. Put down your remote. Big East football or this? Stick with Conference USA. Houston tied the game at 14-14 after Keenumâs 50-yard connection with Justin Johnson paved the way for a short Hayes touchdown run. Southern Mississippi responded with a 3-play, 75-yard drive. After gaining six yards on two plays, Austin Davis hit Dominique Sullivan for a 69-yard touchdown. The Golden Eagles arenât intimidated. Houstonâs quick-strike offense makes no deficit too large. Houston gets on the board. The drive, which spanned 65 yards and took 11 plays, was capped by a nine-yard touchdown catch by Justin Johnson. Southern Mississippiâs lead is cut in half. Houston got it done through the air: Case Keenum completed all six of his attempts on this drive. More specifically, the Cougars got it done with the screen game. Keenum found Charles Sims for a 31-yard gain on third down at the U.S.M. 38. He found Sims again for seven yards two plays later. Later, Keenum hit another running back, Michael Hayes, for a nine yard gain to break into the Southern Mississippi red zone. This short passing game stands in for a traditional running game. But thereâs no replacing a between-the-tackles ground game when it comes to third and short, let alone fourth and short. On 4th-1 from the U.S.M. 22, Houston called on Hayes to move the chains. No passing here; this was Houston under Bill Yeoman, the programâs longtime coach who is credited with inventing the Veer offense. Sumlin never thought about a field goal. Good for him. Also, because the comparison is timely, Sumlin is the anti-Mike Sherman. The latter choked up halftime lead after halftime lead. Sumlinâs team excels over the second half. Offense, defense and special teams. Houstonâs grades in each facet through 18 minutes: D, D and F, respectively. The offense has had chances but has not capitalized. The defense has failed to protect the middle of the field. Special teams? Absolutely abysmal, whether punting with the wind or against the wind. The last punt, even with the wind at Houstonâs back, failed to turn field position back in Houstonâs favor. A personal foul after the Southern Mississippi return cost the Cougars another 15 yards, giving the Golden Eagles possession inside the Houston 40. Three plays later, Southern Mississippi took a 14-0 lead. Austin Davis has thrown two touchdown passes, the latest to special teams ace Tracy Lampley. Itâs time for Houston regroup. Remember what got you here, Cougars: offense, defense and special teams. All facets are coming up well short. And Conference USA starts to sweat. A loss here costs the conference and its 12 teams a significant chunk of change from Houstonâs projected B.C.S. berth. Houston heads into the second quarter trailing Southern Mississippi by 7-0, thanks to a touchdown pass from Austin Davis to Ryan Balentine, but the Cougars arenât worried. Houstonâs been here before. Louisiana Tech held a 20-7 lead at halftime, not to mention a 34-7 lead in the third quarter. UTEP led by 14-0 at the end of the first quarter. Rice led by 17-7 early. That game against the Owls? That was Case Keenumâs nine-touchdown game. So I donât think the Cougars are biting their fingernails at a 7-0 deficit after 15 minutes. And donât bet on this game maintaining its defense-first feel. By my count, Houston has left 14 points on the field. The scoreboard can be deceiving: this is one of those times. On its first series, Houstonâs Case Keenum had a receiver open down the right sideline on a double move. Keenumâs throw was overthrown by about two yards; close, but just out of reach. On this most recent series, Keenum hit the wide receiver Tyron Carrier in stride over the deep middle of the field. Carrier, yards ahead of any Southern Mississippi defensive back and with an easy path to the end zone, dropped the pass. Itâs 0-0. The optimistic U.S.M. fan says that despite some Houston near-misses, the Golden Eagles are in position to take the lead. The pessimistic fan says that U.S.M. has dodged two bullets but has been unable to take advantage of Houstonâs uncharacteristic missteps. During last weekâs game between Arkansas and L.S.U., Gary Danielson of CBS stated that if L.S.U. loses in the B.C.S. title game, the Tigers should still be named the national champion in The Associated Press poll. Danielsonâs logic was simple: L.S.U. would have one loss and Alabama one loss, and each split the yearâs two-game series. With a win, Alabama would be the B.C.S. national champion. L.S.U. would get the top spot in the A.P. poll as a sort of reward for a perfect regular season. I can see where Danielson is coming from. But Iâll go one step further: if L.S.U. loses to Alabama on Jan. 9, Iâd promote a 13-0 Houston team for the No. 1 spot in the A.P. poll. That would involve Houston beating Southern Mississippi today and getting past Michigan in the Sugar Bowl; most have pegged Michigan for that B.C.S. at-large bid. If L.S.U. loses and Houston wins out, wouldnât the Cougars be deserving of being recognized by the A.P. voters? There are 120 teams in the F.B.S. In this scenario, only one, Houston, would be undefeated. Houstonâs Kevin Sumlin is probably going to be the next head coach at Texas A&M. Southern Mississippiâs Larry Fedora might be the next head coach at Arizona State, which wanted Sumlin, or Kansas, or Mississippi. Sumlinâs case is interesting. He wonât be at Houston in 2012, but would he stay on as head coach through January if the Cougars move onto B.C.S. play? Would Fedora, if he gets an offer from Arizona State, stay for a second-tier bowl or pack his bags and leave for Tempe this week? Another layer: Houston assistants Jason Phillips, the offensive coordinator, and Brian Stewart, the defensive coordinator, may be putting on their own auditions for the permanent job. Phillips is the man behind Houstonâs prolific offense. Stewartâs work on defense has been a major factor behind Houstonâs run to 12-0.  Phillips has been there longer, but I think Sumlin will do whatever it takes to take Phillips with him to whatever B.C.S. conference school hires him this month. One thing is sure: Sumlinâs stock will never be higher. Heâs going to strike while the iron is hot. For the former Texas A&M and Oklahoma assistant, the job in College Station should be very, very appealing. This weekâs episode of the Bill Snyder Show, known in some circle as Kansas State football, will not start on time. Due to storms in Manhattan, Kan., the Wildcatsâ game with Iowa State will begin at approximately 1:10 p.m., not noon. As David Ubben of ESPN writes, âWord out of Bill Snyder Family Stadium is a 1:10 p.m. local time kickoff, but that’s barring more lightning. The stadium’s already been cleared.â With a win today, Kansas State can finish with 10 wins for the first time since 2003, when the team was coached by, yes, Bill Snyder. Iowa State, 6-5, has already clinched bowl eligibility. That give the Cyclones two bowl trip in three years under the former Auburn and Pittsburgh assistant Paul Rhoads, who should be a stronger candidate for major job openings across the country. Your up-to-the-minute Big East B.C.S. scenarios: West Virginia sneaked past South Florida on Friday night to move to 9-3, 5-2 in the Big East. Louisville beat the Bulls last Friday to move to 7-5, 5-2 in conference play. Cincinnati hosts Connecticut at noon. The Bearcats enter today at 8-3, 4-2 in the Big East. It should be noted that the Huskies have never won at Cincinnati. It should also be noted that Cincinnati just scored a touchdown in the strangest fashion possible; the Connecticut quarterback Johnny McEntee conceded a safety, but before the whistle blew a Cincinnati defender simply took the ball out of hands. Touchdown, Bearcats. If Cincinnati wins, leaving three teams tied atop the Big East at 5-2, West Virginia will be named the conference champion and earn an automatic B.C.S. bid to the Orange Bowl. Thatâs because the Mountaineers will have the highest ranking in the final B.C.S. standings. If Cincinnati loses, Louisville will head to the Orange Bowl thanks to its head-to-head win over West Virginia earlier this month. Donât bet on Cincinnati losing to Connecticut. It seems like just weeks ago that Butch Davis was still coaching at North Carolina. It seems like mere days since L.S.U. ran over Oregon in Dallas on the first Saturday of September. Wasnât it just yesterday that L.S.U. was beating Alabama in overtime? Time flies. There are 20 games remaining in the 2011 season, minus the 35 bowl games: 19 today, including four conference championship games, and one next Saturday, when Army meets Navy. Letâs soak it up while thereâs still time. At noon, Case Keenum and Houston host Southern Mississippi for the Conference USA championship. With a win, Houston, then 13-0, heads to the Sugar Bowl. If Southern Mississippi wins, Conference USA loses out on about $8 million of B.C.S. money. Keep your eye out for a questionable flag in the fourth quarter. (Just kidding. Sort of.) At 4 p.m., Georgia and L.S.U. meet in Atlanta for the SEC championship. More on this game later in the afternoon, but a brief look ahead: sleep on the Georgia defense at your own peril. More later on. At 8 p.m., Virginia Tech hopes to avenge its lone regular season loss by knocking off Clemson in the A.C.C. Championship Game. Itâs been downhill since October for Clemson, which started 8-0 but lost three of four in November. Also at 8 p.m., Wisconsin and Michigan State meet for the second time in 2011. You remember October, right? The Spartansâ Kirk Cousins, back to pass, lofting a Hail Mary to the end zone that is first batted down by a U.W. defender and then caught by Michigan Stateâs Keith Nichol. Michigan State 37, Wisconsin 31. Thatâs not all. Oklahoma and Oklahoma State: Bedlam. Texas and Baylor: Griffin III. And more.
