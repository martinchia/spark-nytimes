Advertisement  The Pittsburgh Pirates dismissed General Manager LARRY DOUGHTY yesterday despite the team's consecutive National League East titles. Doughty said he was told he had been let go "because my gross errors far outweighed my sucesss." CAM BONIFAY, promoted from scouting director to assistant general manager a year ago, will serve as interim general manager. MARK SAUER, the Pirates' president, said Bonifay is a strong candidate to succeed Doughty. Doughty, 51 years old, said his dismissal by Sauer, a former St. Louis Cardinals executive hired only nine weeks ago, came as "a total shock" and "a great disappointment." Sauer repeatedly refused to elaborate on the dismissal other than to indicate he thought that Doughty has shortcomings in negotiations and the business end of baseball. Sauer hinted that Doughty's trading of several prospects has left the farm system in a precarious position and incapable of replacing some potential free agents: BARRY BONDS, DOUG DRABEK and JOHN SMILEY. BOBBY BONILLA left the Pirates last month to sign a $29 million deal with the Mets. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
