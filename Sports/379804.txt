The Times’s staff provides analysis, pithy commentary and on-the-scene commentary from Super Bowl XLV between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Green Bay Packers in Arlington, Tex. 



12:18 A.M. The Quarterbacks Speak
 Aaron Rodgers: “I love our fans. Our fans are so supportive. It’s been incredible to end four playoff games now with ‘Go Pack Go’ chants on the road… It’s a first-name basis when we see them out. It’s a special place to play and all of us are blessed to live and play in Green Bay, and hopefully we are repaying those fans with the trophy.” Ben Roethlisberger: “You know me, I hate to lose. Like I said, especially, when you feel like you’re letting down guys that really stepped up today in a big way, so it’s really hard.” Jordy Nelson, Packers Wide Receiver: “It’s a game of momentum. We had it in the beginning. They came out in the second half and got it. That fumble was key. It got us some momentum back and we were able to make enough plays to win this game.” Troy Polamalu, Steelers Safety, On Loss: “Toughest one I’ve ever had in my life.” Mike McCarthy, Packers Coach: ” We just kept battling. We had some adversity, we lost some guys to injury and we had some rough plays there… Our guys just kept fighting. I can’t say enough about them.” Mike Tomlin, Steelers Coach: “We’re not into moral victories. We came here to win the football game, of course, and we didn’t do that, Green Bay did and we congratulate them.” Art Rooney, Steelers President: “We’ll go into next year feeling like we’ll take another shot at it. It takes a few days to recover from this game, so we’ll lick our wounds for a couple of days and then get back to work next year” That’s going to do it for our live analysis, but there is much more to come on nytimes.com. Feel free to carry on the conversation in the comments sections.  With the confetti still falling, Judy Battista poses this question on Twitter:  This seems like a fabulous time for a lockout, no? Rodgers will always be linked with Favre, but this victory shows that their connection will be far from the defining aspect of his career. But it should be noted that Favre and Rodgers now each have the same number of Super Bowl victories.  Green Bay General Manager Ted Thompson is not one to brag, as Greg Bishop told us. But it had to be gratifying for him to watch the performance by Rodgers tonight. He put his faith in Rodgers when almost every Green Bay fan in Cheesehead land wanted the team to hold on to Brett Favre. Thompson’s decision was shown to be the right one long before tonight, but this victory is the culmination of Thompson’s pivot away from the Favre era in Green Bay.  Rodgers has been named the game’s most valuable player.  Here are the numbers for Aaron Rodgers: 24 of 39 for 304 yards, 3 touchdowns and, most importantly, no interceptions. Ben Roethlisberger was 25 of 40 for 263 yards and 2 touchdowns, but he also threw 2 interceptions that the Packers converted to 14 points.  Considering the situation, a bit of an anti-climatic ending. After a 15-yard completion, the Steelers are stopped on their next four downs, the last an incomplete pass. That means the Packers are Super Bowl champions! When will they name a street after Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay?  The Packers were held to 3 and now the Steelers have a shot. Greg Bishop is right, one amazing Super Bowl after another. This goes without saying but Iâll say it anyway, this is exactly the situation the fans want to see at a two-minute warning of a Super Bowl. But for Steelers fans, you want those two timeouts back, eh? — Justin Sablich From Greg Bedard of The Boston Globe, via Twtter:
This is almost the same situation as the GB-Pitt game in ’09. Steelers down 6. TD and XP win it. Where’s Josh Bell? After a Rodgers pass is just out of the reach of Jordy Nelson, Mason Crosby kicked a 23-yard field goal to extend the Packers’ lead to 31-25. That leaves the door open for a possible Roethlisberger-led comeback. The Packers are back to being aggressively effective on offense. Rodgers nailed Jennings for a 33-yard reception, Starks ran it for 12 yards and then Rodgers hit Jones for 21 yards. Packers are threatening to put  the Steelers away. — Justin Sablich Just in case, here are the new overtime rules.  From Greg Bishop, via Twitter:  Remember when it seemed like every Super Bowl was a blowout? Last four have been amazing games. Giants, Steelers, Saints, now this What’s to come on Packers’ next drive? They have rushed nine times, total, the entire game. 33 passes. — Bob Goetz George Bretherton writes: Who wants to see an overtime finish? Justin points out that would give us our first look at the new playoff overtime rules in a Super Bowl. There has never been a team that has come back to win a Super Bowl after trailing by 11 points with 12 minutes left to play. But here we are, Steelers down by 3 (thanks to Greg Rosenthal for this tidbit). — Justin Sablich Touchdown Steelers! Roethlisberger throws a 25-yard touchdown pass to Mike Wallace and then pitches to Antwaan Randle-El to convert a 2-point conversion and bring the Steelers within 3. The momentum swings again! Greg Bedard, a former Packers writer now with The Boston Globe, via Twitter:
TD to Jennings. Steelers were completely screwed up in the back end. Should have called timeout, if they had more than 1 So far, the Packers have converted three turnovers by the Steelers into 21 points. On offense, Green Bay has taken care of the ball and not turned it over once.  Good things finally happened to the Packers in the second half. They recovered a Mendenhall fumble on the first play of the fourth quarter. And then, another good thing: a huge 38-yard reception by Nelson. And to cap it off, an 8-yard touchdown pass to Jennings. Itâs amazing how the severely the momentum has changed hands during this game. — Justin Sablich Touchdown Packers! Rodgers to Greg Jennings for an 8-yard touchdown pass. Green Bay extends its lead to 28-17. Troy Polamalu was trailing Jennings on the play, highlighting what has been a subpar game for him.  A play after he dropped a potential first down pass, Jordy Nelson catches one going across the middle and takes it to the 3. The Packers are knocking on the door.  Rashard Mendenhall dropped it after getting it and Green Bay recovers. Is that the break the Packers have been waiting for?  It’s on to the fourth. Pittsburgh is in Green Bay territory and threatening to take the lead. The Steelers have clearly had the momentum throughout the second half. Will they be able to complete the comeback?  It’s an incomplete pass. Packers will punt with 31 seconds left in the quarter.  From Aaron Schatz of Football Outsiders, via Twitter: If PIT had recovered that fumble, they would have challenged the incomplete too, right? The Packers will now be without two of their biggest leaders on the field, Woodson and now Donald Driver, who had two receptions for 28 yards before leaving with an ankle injury. — Justin Sablich  In related news, the Packers just dropped another Rodgers pass that would have converted a third down. Mike McCarthy had asked for an official review.  Pittsburgh didn’t make much noise on that drive, going three and out before punting it back to Green Bay.  The Packers stalled and were forced to punt. Pittsburgh gets the ball at its own 13. In other news, Green Bay receiver Donald Driver is out for the rest of the game.  Granted, that was a long attempt (52 yards), but Shaun Suisham is now 6 for 11 in his career on playoff field goal tries. — Justin Sablich  From Mike Tanier on Twitter: That kick was so wide that Bobby Hill caught it. Pittsburgh looked to be on its way to either a field goal or a touchdown before Clay Matthews made an athletic play to break up a screen pass, Frank Zombo sacked Roethlisberger and Suisham missed a long field-goal attempt. Can’t emphasize enough how big it was for the Packers to get a stop on that drive. Can they seize momentum back?  James Harrison has arrived for the Steelers, bringing an end to the Packersâ second drive of the half with a big sack. Plays like that are helping to fuel an incredibly loud Steelers fan base. Seriously, I canât hear myself think! — Justin Sablich Judy Battista via Twitter: James Harrison’s first play of the night is a doozy. Seriously, I feel like I’m in Heinz Field right now. Poor Charles Woodson. All Woodson, the Packers’ all-everything cornerback, wanted was to make it to the Super Bowl again and be at his best. He played in Super Bowl XXXVII with the Oakland Raiders after undergoing surgery for a broken leg. Alas, he apparently broke his collarbone in this game and will be sidelined for the second half. — Karen Crouse  After Jordy Nelson drops a pass and Aaron Rodgers is sacked, Green Bay is forced to punt. The largest deficit overcome by a winning team in the Super Bowl is 10 points. The Steelers were down 18 in the first half. Could they take the lead on this drive?  It looks like Mendenhall is just fine. He appeared shaken up a few plays before his 8-yard touchdown run after he steamrolled over a cameraman on the sidelines. He now has 55 yards on 10 carries. — Justin Sablich The Steelers’ scoring drive covered 50 yards, all of it on the ground. Old-school Pittsburgh football.  Touchdown Steelers! Mendenhall just had a relatively easy 8-yard path to the end zone and Pittsburgh cut the Packers’ lead to 21-17. The momentum is completely with Pittsburgh right now with 10:25 left in the third quarter.  Steelers fans at Cowboys Stadium surely donât think this one over. They were extremely loud and supportive during the Packersâ first drive of the second half that was derailed by penalties. A bad punt, followed by a 15-yard face mask penalty, has the Steelers in excellent position to start their first drive. — Justin Sablich Green Bay has not had a good start to the second half. First came the news that Charles Woodson had been lost for the game, then James Jones dropped a pass from Aaron Rodgers that looked like it could have gone for a touchdown. Then the Packers were flagged for a face mask on the ensuing punt. Can the Steelers capitalize?  Green Bay cornerback Charles Woodson is out for the rest of the game. Bad news for the Packers.  Pittsburgh’s Troy Polamalu just had his first tackle of the game, though the play was wiped out because of a holding penalty on the Packers. Polamalu has been shockingly quiet.  The biggest question about the halftime show is just where The Black Eyed Peas were hanging out during the first half. Is there a green room inside the massive scoreboard that they dropped from to start the show? Did they have to go there hours before the game, before fans were allowed in? Thereâs no way to walk the cat walk and drop into the scoreboard, at least that we can spot from the stands. And that might have attracted some interesting attention in the middle of the first half. — John Branch More thoughts from Greg:
Love worldwide trending topics: Axl Rose, Boom Boom Pow, Auto Tune, Sweet Child, Puppy Bowl and Step Brothers. Twitter is interesting place. Count Greg Bishop of The Times as one of those unimpressed with the halftime festivities. Here are his thoughts, via Twitter: This reminds me of the opening ceremony during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Minus 2,008 drummers. And less impressive. The Packers, who averaged 7.9 yards per pass when they threw on first down during the regular season, passed on every first down but two in the first half. Aaron Rodgers was 4 of 8 for 45 yards on first downs, including a 21-yard touchdown to Greg Jennings. James Starks had two first-down carries for 19 yards. — Karen Crouse It’s almost time to get back to football. Will the Steelers be able to capitalize on the late momentum they got when Hines Ward caught a touchdown pass in the final minute of the first half? Or will Aaron Rodgers help the Packers make a statement on their first possession and play with the same kind of poise that he did in the opening half?  Mike Tanier, via Twitter, weighs in on the halftime show:  For better or worse, they really are singing.  Judy Battista, via Twitter: Okay, I’m old. But I want The Who back. Sorry. Justin Sablich: Not a big fan personally, but that was entertaining for sure. So I guess the Black Eyed Peas were living in the scoreboard the entire first half? As The Black Eyed Peas provide halftime entertainment, Justin Sablich reminds us that Green Bay has some injury issues:  The Steelers are taking advantage of the holes in the Packersâ secondary. Woodson and Shields are both out with shoulder injuries.  If you take away the Steelers’ late touchdown, the Packers could not have scripted the first half better. They talked endlessly last week about getting off to a fast start, and sure enough they’ve shot out of the blocks like Carl Lewis. They seem determined for the game not to come down to the last play, as it did the last time the teams met, in 2009. Showing he is a student of the game, Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers said last week, “You look at the last 10 Super Bowls and eight of the nine teams that have won the turnover ratio have won the game. So you can’t turn it over against them and expect to win.” Or vice versa. The Steelers’ Ben Roethlisberger has thrown two interceptions that the Packers have converted into 14 points.   There is life in the Steelers yet. An eight-yard touchdown pass to Hines Ward cuts the Packers’ lead to 21-10 with 47 seconds left in the half. Huge score for Pittsburgh heading into halftime.  Charles Woodson is now on the sideline. He appeared to injure his shoulder as he broke up a pass attempted for Mike Wallace near the end zone. — Justin Sablich The Packers have yet to run on first down: incomplete, incomplete, incomplete, four-yard completion. As Mike Tanier said, “forget establishing the run.”  Rodgers is in an absolute zone, but donât forget the effect that running back James Starks is having.  He had a key 12-yard run on the last drive and his play is only making things easier for Rodgers and the receivers. — Justin Sablich Greg Bishop, via Twitter, on the touchdown Rodgers threw to Jennings:  How many NFL QBs make that throw that Green Bay QB Aaron Rodgers just made? Not many. This one’s getting out of hand.  From Judy Battista, via Twitter:
Lots of injuries already. There are swaths of the field that were replaced — wonder if that has anything to do with it.  Frank Zombo is a Green Bay rookie linebacker who was thrust into the starting lineup when Eric Walden was injured. Zombo has three tackles, which suggests he has corralled the pregame nerves he expected to battle. Last week he explained how he expected to be feeling today: “You are a nervous wreck. You are playing for a lot.” He added: “You have a lot to play for. You are playing for your job. You are playing for your family. You are playing for your coaches.”  — Karen Crouse The Steelers had a nice little drive going and Roethlisberger appeared to be settling into a rhythm. Then Jarrett Bush stepped in front of a pass and the Packers regained momentum. It didn’t take them long to capitalize. Several plays later, Rodgers tossed a 21-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings to make the score Packers 21, Steelers 3, with 2:31 left in the half.   Steelers fans are getting crankier at Cowboys Stadium after the refs just appeared to miss a face-mask call on Mendenhall. The refs are probably the only ones not impressed with the giant screen hovering above the field. — Justin Sablich According to Pro Football Talk, the 400 fans who bought tickets for seats that didn’t quite exist have been allowed into the stadium.  Packers receiver Donald Driver was just shown limping to the locker room. As you probably recall, he has recently been dealing with a quadriceps injury.  On the Steelersâ last drive, Roethlisberger finally came up big on a third-and-13 at the Packersâ 35-yard line, hitting Sanders for a first down. The drive was kept alive and while the Steelers were held to 3 points, it was vital for them to at least get on the board. Most of the teamâs offensive success has come on the ground so far, with 51 yards compared to 37 through the air. — Justin Sablich The Steelers get some much-needed points on the board, as Shaun Suisham’s 33-yard field goal capped a nine-play, 49 yard drive that took 7:12. Pittsburgh would have preferred a touchdown, obviously, but points are points.  Nick Collins challenged Ben Roethlisberger to throw at him, saying last week: “He just has to bring it. I am a competitive guy and I know about this game.” It wasn’t exactly Babe Ruth calling  his home run shot but Collins does have more scoring catches than any Steeler to this point. — Karen Crouse On the first play of the second quarter, Charles Woodson makes a terrific play and wraps up Pittsburgh running back Rashard Mendenhall for a two-yard loss.  The Steelers’ starting right tackle Flozell Adams has a right shoulder injury and his return is questionable. The Steelers already have used six different offensive line combinations during the season and now they have to hope they have a lucky seventh. — Karen Crouse The Packers were penalized for excessive celebration after Collins returned an interception for a touchdown. On her Twitter page, Judy Battista had this reaction: They call excessive celebration penalties in the Super bowl? Really??  Who is Jordy Nelson? Nelson, a small-town Kansas native, looked around Cowboys Stadium on media day: âA bunch of farmers would like to have a building like this. You could put every piece of machinery, every cow, every bale, everything you need in here.”  The Kansas City Star has more.  The Steelers take over on their own 7 after a penalty on the kickoff, and then things get ugly. Roethlisberger drops back, gets hit as he throws and the ball is intercepted by Nick Collins, who returned it 37 yards for a touchdown. Just like that, it’s Packers 14, Steelers 0.  Green Bay has a really good thing going on offense and Rodgers looked much sharper on that drive, completing five of his six attempts. I canât wait to see how Dick Lebeau is going to try to slow down the Packers on the next drive. F.Y.I.: The Packers have now scored first in all five of their Super Bowl appearances. — Justin Sablich Jordy Nelson catches a 29-yard touchdown pass on third-and-1 with William Gay covering. This was Jordy last week: “I think we need to convert on third downs to win the game.”  — Karen Crouse Touchdown, Packers! Rodgers and Jordy Nelson didn’t miss this time. Rodgers threw a terrific pass that Nelson hauled in over William Gay for a 29-yard touchdown catch that put Green Bay up, 7-0. That capped an 80-yard touchdown drive.  Packers are doing a better job of protecting Rodgers on this drive and the teamâs aggressive approach is starting to pay off a bit more.  First-and-10 at midfield. — Justin Sablich Stuart Elliott of The Times is monitoring the Super Bowl commercials on the Media Decoder blog.  James Starks just bounced outside and picked up a first down for the Packers, but not before the slow start drew this satiric Twitter message from Mike Vaccaro of The New York Post:  NFLPA just confirmed that Steeler & Packer offenses have gotten a jump on the work stoppage From Judy Battista, via Twitter:  Let’s see if Packers can do better job protecting Rodgers on this drive. He’s gotten smacked twice already. Three drives, three punts. Neither team has gotten much going on offense yet. With 8:17 left in the opening quarter, the Packers will take over on their own 20 and Aaron Rodgers will get his second chance at the Steelers’ defense.  Aaron Rodgers just missed Jordy Nelson at the Steelersâ 15-yard line for what would have been an easy touchdown. It looked like a play Nelson could have made. Rodgers completed just one of his four attempts on the first drive, a nice 24-yard toss to Donald Driver on an early third-down conversion. I find myself watching the video board more than the actual game. It’s like the coolest, biggest TV ever invented. Real time, too. — Greg Bishop Christina Aguilera apparently messed up the words to the national anthem, repeating the phrase “what so proudly we hailed.” She was also timed at 1 minute 55 seconds, a bit of an upset. Prognosticators figured she would fly right past the two-minute mark.   Green Bay’s Tramon Williams just fumbled a punt return, but the Packers recovered at their own 20.  Fun fact from Canada: the columnist Bruce Arthur just wrote on Twitter that the N.F.C. had won 13 straight coin tosses before today. Well, make that 14, with an added bonus: that awesome Deion Sanders suit. Not many could pull that off. But Prime Time can. — Greg Bishop The newest members of the Hall of Fame were out on the field for the coin toss, with Deion Sanders, not surprisingly, getting a huge ovation. Steelers will receive the kick. — Justin Sablich Before the game, the giant 60-yard long video screen over the field showed former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura. Fans gave the former Texas governor a large roar. — John Branch Steelers fans appear to have the edge amongst those in attendance, bringing a bit more noise than Packers fans during the team introductions. There were certainly more Terrible Towels spinning than the rival Title Towels that Packers fans have brought in. — Justin Sablich  Judy Battista via Twitter: “There are A LOT of Steelers fans here. Seems like more than Packers, although you can’t twirl a Cheesehead.” If you’re the type of person who watches the Super Bowl for the commercials (and we know there are millions of you out there), then the Sports Business Journal has done you a serious service. Here is the lineup for which commercials will air when during the broadcast. (Hat tip to Quickish for the link).  The Texas Christian  marching band just brought the house down! The fans in attendance are  certainly ready for kickoff; the decibel level is rising. — Justin Sablich From Time’s Sean Gregory, picture of the line of ticketholders outside Cowboys Stadium 35 minutes before kickoff. As he does every game, Ted Thompson, the Packers general manager, is sitting in the press box. He is in the second row, surrounded by reporters. This is funny, if only because Thompson ranks among the most unassuming executives in sports, and while he is accommodating and deals regularly with the media, he definitely does not enjoy the whole media portion of his job. Itâs not in his nature. Thompson did look relaxed, though. He was eating fried okra and talking to a few reporters. He did not seem as nervous as you might have expected him to be. –Greg Bishop For Green Bay, Frank Zombo will start at right outside linebacker instead of Erik Walden, who is on the inactive list. For Pittsburgh, center Maurkice Pouncey, who was the subject of much speculation last week on whether heâd play, is on injured reserve. Dorian Brooks will start in his place.  — Justin Sablich UPDATED N.F.L. STATEMENT: Incomplete installation of temporary seats in a limited number of sections made the seats unusable. Approximately 850 fans with tickets in sections 205A, 215A, 230A, and 240A were affected and were relocated to similar or better seats. Four hundred (400) fans in sections 425A and 430A were not able to be accommodated with seats inside the stadium. These fans will each receive a refund of triple the cost of the face value of their ticket. The face value of these tickets are $900. The safety of fans attending the Super Bowl was paramount in making the decision and the NFL, Dallas Cowboys and City of Arlington officials are in agreement with the resolution. We regret the situation and inconvenience that it may have caused. We will conduct a full review of this matter.
–Karen Crouse For those fans who actually have seats, they are starting to make some noise with the players now out stretching on the field. Aaron Rodgers just got a huge roar out of the Packers fans. At first glance, black and yellow seem to be outnumbering the green and yellow, but there are still plenty of empty seats yet to be filled. — Justin Sablich NFL.com cannot be happy posting a story about its Super Bowl stadium not being ready.  There are four police guarding one of the unusable temporary seating areas, at the top of the stadium below a hanging Pepsi sign, and the area is cordoned off with yellow police tape.  — Karen Crouse “Packers GM Ted Thompson might be the most unassuming man in sports. Saw him eating in the press box — looking for a seat!” — Greg Bishop via Twitter Despite some reports that temporary seating fiasco would affect 6-9,000 fans, Darren Rovell of CNBC reporting the number to be much smaller, via Twitter: “NFL: Only 400 fans will not be accomodated. They will get $2,700 for each ticket. 850 fans got similar or better seats.” Players on the field. Rumor of an actual football game might come true. In another hour.  If Animal Planet’s Puppy Bowl started at 3 Eastern, can they really be only to the Kitty Halftime Show?  Greg Bishop is one of our many reporters at Cowboys Stadium covering the Super Bowl. With kickoff about an hour and a half away, listen to his take on the keys to victory for the Steelers and the Packers. CNBC’s Darren Rovell out in front of the outrage over Cowboy Stadium seat snafu, via Twitter:
“Not sure where the NFL got the 3X face value # to pay back fans. People in affected area paid an average of 4X to 6X face.” And, “NFL doesn’t have an obligation to pay secondary prices, but they do have an obligation to sell a seat THAT ACTUALLY EXISTS.” The N.F.L. just released this statement. Some fans will be very upset if this situation doesnât get resolved: âThere are a limited number of sections in temporary seating areas inside the stadium that have not been fully completed. We are working to resolve the matter and expect that by game time most of the fans affected will have been accommodated in their seats or relocated to similar better seatsâ¦ Fans who are not accommodated with seats inside the stadium will each receive a refund of triple the cost of the face value of their ticket. We regret the situation.â — Justin Sablich According to WFAA-TV in Dallas, temporary seating in Cowboys Stadium is not ready, prompting N.F.L. to give refunds of three-times face value for people expecting to sit in them. The Times’s sports editor for the past eight years, Tom Jolly is spending his first Super Bowl in his new job at The Times. Now that he’s not running our Super Bowl show, he offers his perspective of how the Times covers a Super Bowl. And why we should appreciate the job done by Judy Battista. If you were wondering, the White House Super Bowl party menu is not an example of healthy eating (oh, except for the salad. What’s up with that?) A photo of Vince Lombardi’s grave today, after fans made their yearly reverential visit. Only question: a Pabst Blue Ribbon? WFAA-TV in Dallas is reporting some of the gates at Cowboys Stadium remain closed because of snow and ice on the roof. Falling ice injured several earlier this week. Going rate for tickets is close to $4,000 each outside the stadium, but there are a lot more buyers than sellers. Scalping is illegal in Arlington near the stadiums, but it’s not stopping people from negotiating. One guy, Gaylen Paulson of Austin, Texas, was looking outside the stadium for four tickets. He’s willing to pay up to $2,500 each. Three hours before game time, he could find no one willing to sell. Economy? What ecomomy? — John Branch Fans who just arrived for the Super Bowl on Saturday or today have a very distorted view of what the weather has been like in Dallas. The sun finally showed up yesterday and at the moment itâs a balmy 53 degrees outside the stadium. But temperatures are expected to drop into the 40s over the next few hours and rain and snow showers are expected by 9:00 p.m. Central time. No matter for those safe inside Jerryâs World, but not a pleasant commute. — Justin Sablich According to Nate Silver of our FiveThirtyEight blog, Super Bowls with close point spreads usually do not produce close games. By most lines, the Packers are favored by 2-3 points. Ginormous TV screen in the stadium is so clear I can see the pattern in Scott Hanson’s tie. (Nice tie, Scott!) — Judy Battista via Twitter Ever want to commemorate a Super Bowl in waffles? Us neither, but to each their own. Nearly 7,400 votes in on our interactive video feature on who will win the Super Bowl. Steelers are running away with this, 67 percent. Packers fans, what’s up? From Mike Tanier, via Twitter: “Pit bull puppy on espn2 picks packers dog bowl. If eagles were in the game they’d use a goldfish.” The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
