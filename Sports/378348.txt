âBack in the day, I didnât really care,â said Dallas’s Vince Carter, in the visitorsâ locker room after a game at Minnesota. âIâm suffering now.â Heâs talking about the price of a youth lived at the rim, recorded in highlight reel after highlight reel: his self-alley-oop off the glass at the 2005 N.B.A. All-Star Game; the 360 reverse windmill with which he opened the 2000 Slam Dunk Contest; the time he went toe-to-toe with Alonzo Mourning, rising above one of the N.B.A.âs best rim protectors to slam it home. And, of course, his legendary leap over 7-2 Frederic Weis in the 2000 Summer Olympics. It was dubbed the âdunk of deathâ by the French media. His game these days might not be as aggressively vertical but itâs impressive in its own way. Against the depleted Timberwolves, Carterâs Mavericks orchestrated a convincing 100-77 win. Carter poured in 22 points in 25 minutes off the bench. He scored with cold precision, going 4-for-5 from 3-point range and 8-for-15 overall. More important, with the teamâs leading rebounder Shawn Marion out with a calf injury, Carter delivered 9 rebounds. âIâve made it my business to be locked in and do whateverâs needed,â he said. âI just wanted to pick up on the boards and help out, just give our bigs another rebounder. I think it helps me: keeps me active and keeps me engaged as well.â After eight All-Star Game appearances, Carterâs willingness to fill the gaps â to be the mortar instead of the bricks â might be surprising, but the sixth man role in Dallas agrees with him. His per-36-minute stats show him scoring at the best rate since his 2009-10 season while notching 5.7 rebounds-per-36 (highest since his rookie year) and shooting 41 percent from the arc (highest since 2004-5). The advanced stats look even better: his true shooting percentage (57 percent) and effective field goal percentage (53 percent) are both career highs. âI feel comfortable here,â he said by way of explanation. âIâm in a great situation here as far as utilizing my talent and my ability to make plays, be a playmaker. It doesnât have to be scoring. We have so many guys that can do so many things that you trust them with the ball. And they trust me to knock down shots and make plays. Itâs a perfect match.â But if heâs having a career year in many ways, redemption is not the the way to label it. Carterâs will to win has been questioned ever since he chose to attend his graduation from North Carolina on the morning of a decisive Game 7 against the Philadelphia 76ers in the 2001 Eastern Conference semifinals. When his potentially game-winning 3-point shot rimmed out, the rumbling began. Itâs not clear those rumblings bother him. He may never win a championship, but at 36, heâs a dedicated professional, a craftsman, drawing on a broad array of skills to accomplish the job. The mantle of the versatile veteran fits him well. Those early flashes of athletic transcendence, when he seemed to combine the grace and fluidity of Michael Jordan with the thunderous power of Dominique Wilkins, were not illusory so much as mismeasured. They were only snapshots. Asked if dunking is as much fun as it looks, he grimaces. âNowadays? I do it because I can, but sometimes, the landings suck. That takes the toll on your body. If itâs needed, itâs needed. But if I can make the two points by layup, Iâm going to do that. You have to be smart about it.â Smart isnât always lauded in athletics, but Carter has learned the game lasts much longer than a dunk. âWhen youâre younger,â he said, âyou donât really care how you land when you come down.â After 15 years in the league, Carter has managed a graceful landing in Dallas, championship or not.
