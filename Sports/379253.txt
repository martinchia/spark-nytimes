Jose Reyes left the Mets on Monday after the death of his grandmother and may be gone as long as a week on bereavement leave. That means a team already battered by injuries will now be without its best everyday player this season. Reyes, who had four hits in Sundayâs 9-5 victory over the Phillies, including his seventh and eighth triples of the season, found about his grandmother after he showed up at the Mets’ clubhouse Monday afternoon to prepare for a night game against the Pirates. The Mets spokesman Jay Horwitz said Reyes would be gone a minimum of three days and as many as seven, under the guidelines of baseballâs bereavement policy. For Monday’s game, Ruben Tejada was in the lineup at shortstop batting eighth, Justin Turner at second base batting second, and Willie Harris at third leading off. The Mets are already missing two key pieces of their lineup â third baseman David Wright and first baseman Ike Davis â both out with injuries that may keep them from returning for several more weeks. Angel Pagan, who was out for a month with an oblique injury, finally returned to the lineup in recent days. The Mets activated reliever Bobby Parnell from the disabled list to take Reyes’s roster spot.
