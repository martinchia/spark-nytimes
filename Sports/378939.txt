Jene Bramel of Footballguys.com covered the defensive practices at the Senior Bowl from Mobile, Ala, on Tuesday.  North Squad Scouts and team observers flocked to the fence to watch Mike Singletary take the North linebacker group through individual drills. The Vikings moved through individual drills at a fairly brisk pace, but throughout practice Singletary could be heard giving tips on footwork,Â body position when changing direction, alignment and run fits, and recognition skills. The North defensive roster does not have the depth of talent that the South has, but a few players turned in notable performances on Day 2. Lavonte David, Nebraska Davidâs measurables are not elite, but he looks the part on the field. Singletary wanted him to slow down and keep his feet underneath him during individual drills, and David settled quickly after that. He pancaked Washington running back Chris Polk, who had been otherwise solid, on a 1-on-1 pass protection rep and was impressive throughout unit drills in coverage. He dropped to his coverage landmarks quicker than any linebacker on either roster thus far and showed good change of direction and awareness in man coverage underneath. He did not stand out as a run defender Tuesday, but wasnât a clear liability either. Bobby Wagner, Utah State Wagner drew praise early for his hustle and speed in special-teams drills and then earned a compliment from Singletary for his good body lean while changing direction in individual footwork drills. He was on the line of scrimmage at outside linebacker and consistently showed the ability to anchor at the point of attack and shed blocks. Through two days, heâs ahead of Emmanuel Acho, James-Michael Johnson and Nigel Bradham as the most impressive between-the-tackles run-stuffing linebacker prospect. Audie Cole, North Carolina State Cole drew coaching from Singletary for chopping footwork and body position during drills and for a couple of missed coverage landmarks in 7-on-7 reps. But he was very good against the backs in blitz pickup drills, showing a good swim move and a quick step outside. He changed direction well for a player his size and still looks like a solid, but not spectacular, scheme-diverse every-down outside linebacker. Demario Davis, Arkansas State Davis, a late addition to the North roster this week, was very impressive. Singletary made an effort to improve his footwork during drills, hammering home the point that a wider, lower base and keeping his feet close to the ground would keep him upright when changing direction. Davis, who played inside, was a half beat slow to react on some snaps, but was violent coming downhill after making his read. He was also extremely quick and explosive in the blitz pickup drills, beating backs and tight ends consistently. Unlike Nigel Bradham on the South roster, he had no trouble getting his players lined up quickly and correctly. Heâs going to draw notice if his performance remains strong through the rest of the week. George Iloka, Boise State Iloka had some difficulty when matched against a wide receiver in 1-on-1 drills, but looked very fluid in space and coming up to make plays in zone coverage. His quick recognition and reaction on an underneath route earned him a diving interception and set the tone for the North defense early in team drills. Antonio Allen flashed improvements in coverage during the South afternoon session, but Iloka has been the better all-around safety prospect in practice and should be moving up draft boards. Cam Johnson reportedly had a strong practice yesterday and showed a consistently strong effort with his hand on the ground. He was not an explosive pass rusher, but set the edge well against the run. Vinny Curry showed enough of a burst to beat his opponent off the edge, but his body lean often takes him to the ground rather than allowing him to turn the corner.Â Â At times in team drills, however, he was able to get upfield well in his run fits. Jack Crawford won his share of confrontations today by using his hands well, but there are still concerns on whether heâll turn the corner well in pass rush or anchor as a run defender. Derek Wolfe, Kendall Reyes and Billy Winn split snaps at end and tackle.Â  Winn and Reyes were more consistent than Wolfe. James-Michael Johnson was impressive at times during the back-on-backer pass protection drills, but he had a lot of difficulty changing direction and generally played too high. When his pad level was better, he showed good power at the point of attack. Shea McClellin is much smoother from a two-point stance than Jake Bequette was Monday. The North coaches also gave McClellin a couple of snaps as a down defensive end late in team drills, and he showed a good spin move to collapse the pocket. South Squad Juron Criner made a couple of ahh-inducing catches, but the story of the day was the dominant play of the South defensive line. One group, made up of Quinton Coples, Brandon Thompson and Courtney Upshaw (along with the solid but not spectacular Kheeston Randall),Â won consistently in every drill and then blew up nearly every play the South offense tried to run in team drills. Melvin Ingram and Jaye Howard made things nearly as tough anchoring the second group. Quinton Coples, North Carolina Itâs not an exaggeration to say that Coples won 90 percent of his reps in practice Tuesday. He again made his opponents whiff at times on his go-to inside rip and swim move and flashed a rare, but effective edge rush move with good lean. Heâs been strong enough to get away with a high pad level when defending the run. His play, albeit against what may be questionable competition, was again evoking strongÂ comparisons to Julius Peppers. Casey Hayward, Vanderbilt Most of the South corners flashed their skills at one point or another, but Hayward drew the most praise from the vocal Washington defensive backsÂ coach Raheem Morris. Showing very good change of direction Â and the ability to use his hands effectively in press coverage, Hayward frequently broke up passes with a quick burst back to the ball. Juron Criner was able to get separation with his big frame at times, but Hayward was usually right in his pocket. Brandon Thompson, Clemson Coples will get all the headlines from practice Tuesday, but Thompson dominated just as frequently. Thompson consistently got under the pads of his blocker and either drove him back or stood his ground and shed easily. He was in the backfield extremely quickly on a number of 7-on-7 snaps and disrupted a handful of rushing plays in team drills. Zach Brown, North Carolina Brown, who may have been holding back a bit on the soggy field Monday, was arguably the best linebacker on the South roster Tuesday. He was much quicker through the footwork drills and rarely needed to look down to judge where he was between pads. He was the most consistent backer in coverage drills, never getting lost when needing TO stop quickly and change direction on a route. He was also very sudden shooting gaps from the back side and would have made multiple tackles for loss if the 7-on-7 session was a live tackling drill. He and Lavonte David have been the class of the Will linebacker prospects this week. Coplesâs efforts were nearly matched by Melvin Ingram, who played with better leverage Tuesday, collapsed the pocket well and even tossed a running back to the ground like a rag doll to end one play. Courtney Upshaw also had a good practice. His pass rush catalog is limited, without a true edge rushing capability, but his pad level was consistently better than his opponentâs all day. Sean Spence seemed to be guessing during coverage drills, often getting lost by the running back coming out of his break. He was nearly as effective in pursuit as Brown in team drills, however, and again regularly helped Nigel Bradham get the team lined up out of the huddle. Bradham struggled Tuesday in all phases. He was turned badly on one long-gaining running play and looked especially limited in coverage. Keenan Robinson closed on routes much better Tuesday, breaking up multiple passes in man coverage, but was also grabbing his receiver too often near the end of the play. Antonio Allen was better in coverage in Day 2, breaking on underneath routes better. But he still looks stiff when backpedaling and needs to gather himself to change direction.
