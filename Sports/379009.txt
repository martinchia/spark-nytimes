It has been a great year for Loyola (Md.) athletics. The menâs basketball team made the N.C.A.A. tournament for the first time since 1994. The womenâs lacrosse team won the Big East for the second consecutive season. And the menâs lacrosse team earned a spot in the final four in Foxborough, Mass., with a win over Denver last weekend. While all those feats were impressive, Loyola fans wanted more. While the basketball team is just establishing itself as a midmajor program to be taken seriously, and success is relatively new for the womenâs lacrosse team, the menâs lacrosse program does not find itself in uncharted territory. The team reached the semifinals for the third time in 22Â years but had notÂ made that far since 1998, when the Greyhounds fell to Maryland. Eight years earlier, Loyola hadÂ defeated Yale in overtime to advance to the title game for the only time in school history before losing to Syracuse. This season, the Greyhounds went from unranked and overlooked in the preseason to the No. 1 seed heading into the N.C.A.A. tournament. They erased a four-goal, fourth-quarter deficit against archrival Johns Hopkins only to lose in the final seconds of overtime. They defeated Denver, the Eastern College Athletic Conferenceâs second-best team, three times (in the regular season, the E.C.A.C. final and the N.C.A.A. tournament) en route to an all-time best 17-1 record. Coach Charley Toomey has kept his team focused on the national championship since fall ball in the first semester of this academic year. The seventh-year head coach wasÂ an all-American goalkeeper who led the Greyhounds to their only title game appearance, in 1990. The outcome, a 21-9 loss to Syracuse, still stings. On Saturday, the Greyhoundsâ high-powered offense, led by Tewaaraton finalist Mike Sawyer and fellow attackman Eric Lusby, must solve one of the nationâs best defenses and top goalkeeper John Kemp. Sawyer set a school record with 51 goalsÂ this season,Â and Lusby now has 50. Notre Dameâs offense was peaking heading into the semifinals. âThey are terrific on the defensive end,â Toomey said before the game. âIt starts with John Kemp. He is probably one of the best goalies in the nation, and they limit teams to only eight or seven goals a game.â The objective for the Greyhounds will be a score that features double digits. If they can do that, Notre Dame could have a hard time keeping up. Steve Gesuele is the sports editor of The Greyhound at Loyola University.
