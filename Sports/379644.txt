Magic Johnson, who has joined the effort to have the N.F.L. return to Los Angeles, was an honorary co-chairman of a recent fund-raiser in Harlem. It marked the collaboration of Mount Sinai School of Medicineâs Center for Multicultural and Community Affairs with Jazzmobile, which provides free music education and performance programs to children throughout the neighborhood. The center and Jazzmobile aim to interest children and young adults in careers involving math, science, medicine and music. Johnson, 51, won five N.B.A. championships as a point guard with the Los Angeles Lakers. In 1991, he was found to have the virus that causes AIDS.   What does this cause mean to you?  It means a great deal. Mount Sinai provides wonderful health care, and a platform for those living in Harlem who want to be doctors. Jazzmobile has been there to provide young people a place to learn music, which is so important considering the fact that music departments at many schools have been eliminated for budgetary reasons.  How is your health?  My health is great. Iâve been through the AIDS ward at Mount Sinai, so I have seen the hospitalâs great work firsthand. I love the team of doctors there and often go by to talk to the patients and help lift their spirits.   LeBron James left Cleveland to team with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami. Would you ever have considered joining forces with Larry Bird and Michael Jordan?  It never entered my mind because I wanted to beat Larry and Michael. We all wanted to beat each other; thatâs what it was all about when we played. LeBron is trying to win a championship in Miami, and he will have to prove that it was a good decision. But a lot of teams are going to have a lot to say about that, especially Boston and Orlando in the East, and the Lakers in the West, who I think will three-peat.  Do you think basketball is as exciting a team game as when you played, or has it evolved into a series of one-on-one games within a game?  There are some teams out there, like Boston and Los Angeles, who do play great team basketball. But the real problem for many of todayâs superstars is that they havenât won championships, so fans have not really gravitated toward them. Michael, Larry and myself all won championships. Fans love Kobe Bryant because he has been a winner, but guys like LeBron and Dwight Howard and Amarâe Stoudemire, they havenât won anything yet.   Can you compare James, Wade and Bosh to your teammates James Worthy and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?  You canât compare them to us until they win four or five championships like we did. You have to remember, itâs still about winning.  Who was a more dominant center, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar or Shaquille OâNeal?  Oh, Kareem. Oh, yes. Shaq can only score with power, but Kareem could score so many different ways. He had a hook shot and a bank shot and could hit his free throws and dominate late when games were hanging in the balance. I donât think you will ever find a center in basketball more dominant on the offensive end than Kareem. The man was just incredible.   What player today reminds you of Magic Johnson?  I think LeBron. Heâs just as big as I was and can control a game like I did. Jason Kidd, who is still out there, also reminds me a little bit of myself.  Who was your idol growing up?  Oscar Robertson. My dad loved Wilt Chamberlain, so I loved Wilt Chamberlain. But in terms of playing point guard, the Big O was my guy.  What are you doing these days in the world of business?  Iâm trying to bring an N.F.L team back to Los Angeles as a part-owner. Iâm still vice president of the Lakers, but I sold all of my shares, so Iâm kind of a like a free agent now.  Tell us something no one knows about you.  Unfortunately, my life is so public that what you see is what you get. Iâm a guy who cares a great deal about the community, a guy who tries to be a great husband and a great father, and Iâm a competitive guy. When I play my daughter, who is 15, I let her get to 9 points, and then I crush her. I love to win at everything I do.
