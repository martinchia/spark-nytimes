NEW ORLEANS â In the most recent generation of college basketball, comparisons to Floridaâs back-to-back N.C.A.A. title teams may be the highest compliment in the sport. So when Florida Coach Billy Donovan brought up those teams when talking about Butler, it was an impressive comparison.  Donovan said one thing that gets overlooked with those Florida teams is their will to win.  Referring to the teams that were led by Joakim Noah, Al Horford and Corey Brewer, Donovan said, âWhen you get to this point in time in the season is â and I had this with Noah, Horford and Brewer and those guys â there was such an internal will, and I thought our internal will was terrific.â   Donovan said he saw similarities between those squads and Brad Stevensâs Butler teams.

âI thought today their internal will and coming down with some of those balls and being â not that they wanted it more than our guys, they just were quicker reacting,â he said.  Donovan added, âI think their awareness and their will at that point in time and their maybe refusal to be denied, so to speak, was something I thought really stood out.â No player better epitomized that than Matt Howard, Butlerâs floppy-haired star. He made the gameâs most fitting play, diving on the floor for a loose ball in overtime that essentially sealed the outcome.  âMatt Howard will be an N.B.A. player and his team would be winning wherever he went to school,â Stevens said. âThatâs who he is. He makes teams better. He is a winner. Whenever I have to answer questions about whatâs his real height, how long is he, he wins. He just wins.â And No. 8 Butler just keeps winning. In a week, it could have something else in common with Donovanâs Gator teams from 2006 and 2007.
