The Mets announced Friday that they recently laid off nearly 10 percent of their 180 front-office employees, a development that will only further discourage a fan base bracing for the possible departure of Jose Reyes, their free-agent shortstop. In a statement, the team said: âSeveral weeks ago, we made work-force reductions in both the baseball and business-operations departments, which amounted to less than 10 percent of our full-time staff.â The acknowledgment of the layoffs comes just a day after free agents like Reyes became eligible to sign with any team they wish. It also comes amid speculation that the Mets, with all their financial problems, will not try to outbid other teams to retain Reyes and will be limited on what they can spend on any other players who will be available.

Attendance at Citi Field fell 7 percent this season as the Mets finished in fourth place for the third consecutive year. The Mets also laid off a handful of workers in the ticket office last February. These are particularly difficult times for the Mets because of their performance on the field, the overall economy and their ownersâ ongoing legal battle with Irving H. Picard, the trustee for the victims of the Bernard L. Madoff Ponzi scheme. The teamâs principal owner, Fred Wilpon, said earlier in the season that the team might lose as much as $70 million this year, after posting a $51 million loss in 2010. Wilpon and his co-owner, Saul Katz, are being sued by Picard on behalf of Madoff victims and remain liable for up to $386 million in connection with their years of investments with Madoff. If there is no settlement in the case, a trial could take place in the first part of next year. The Mets have already announced that they are cutting ticket prices for 2012, the third straight season they are making such a move to bolster sagging attendance. Next year, no full 81-game season-ticket holder will pay more than this year, and more than 80 percent of the people in that category will have their ticket prices fall at least 5 percent. About a year ago, the team borrowed $25 million from Major League Baseball because of a cash shortage. The loan was supposed to be repaid by the end of June, but that has not happened because of the collapse of a deal in which the hedge fund manager David Einhorn would have made a $200 million investment in the club. The Mets are instead trying to secure a group of minority partners â perhaps 10 in all â who would purchase small shares of the team for perhaps $20 million apiece and thus provide the needed infusion of cash. Commissioner Bud Selig acknowledged last month at the World Series that the Mets had not repaid the $25 million loan. Nevertheless, he maintained that the teamâs current financial state was not worrisome to him. âWeâre doing fine with the Mets,â he said in remarks to reporters at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. âI donât have any concerns with the Mets. Theyâre working on an alternative financing plan, and they seem to be very encouraged, and Iâm encouraged.â The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
