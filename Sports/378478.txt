Advertisement By MALCOLM MORAN As soon as the final seconds disappeared in Tucson, Ariz., last Saturday, the focus of the college football season switched from another Washington-Miami debate to the possibility of a championship game in the Sugar Bowl. Washington's loss at Arizona created the possibility of a Miami-Alabama matchup, which could satisfy everyone outside of College Station, Tex., home of the undefeated, untied and unappreciated Texas A&M Aggies. The Hurricanes took control of the No. 1 position in The Associated Press's poll, which will be used by the new coalition of bowl games in the selections that will take place Dec. 6. In The New York Times's computer ranking, Miami is second to Nebraska, ahead of third-place Washington. But there is no celebration in New Orleans. Not yet. "I've been around too long," said Mickey Holmes, the executive director of the Sugar Bowl. A Few Stumbling Blocks Advertisement As the regular season reaches its final weeks, there are several games that could still test the orderly process that the new coalition of bowl games has attempted to create. Holmes's immediate worry will take place today at Starkville, Miss., where the meeting between unbeaten Alabama and Mississippi State is being called the most important in the history of Scott Field. Advertisement Alabama (9-0) has a two-game lead over Mississippi State in the west division of the newly aligned Southeastern Conference. With a loss today, the Crimson Tide, second in The Associated Press's poll and fourth in The Times's ranking, could still reach the inaugural conference championship game on Dec. 5 -- it finishes the regular season on Thanksgiving against Auburn -- but Alabama's hope is to play in that title game, for the spot in the Sugar Bowl, still having a chance to win the national championship. Miami (8-0) will be host to Temple at the Orange Bowl today. The Hurricanes have a chance to extend the nation's longest major-college winning streak to 27 games. Barring an unexpected Hurricane bid to the Orange Bowl, this will be Miami's last home game of the season. Miami's most serious remaining challenge will come a week from today at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, against the Orangemen.

Syracuse will meet Boston College today at Chestnut Hill, Mass., in a game that is expected to send the winner to the Fiesta Bowl. Under an agreement announced last week by the Big East Conference, a third team from the league -- the Syracuse-Boston College loser -- will go to the Hall of Fame Bowl in Tampa, Fla. Michigan, seventh in the Times ranking and No. 3 in the Associated Press poll, will meet Illinois. Texas A&M (10-0), fourth in The Associated Press's poll and ninth in The Times's ranking, defeated Houston on Thursday night. Notre Dame will play against Penn State at South Bend, Ind., in the final game of a series that has seen the teams meet each year since 1981.  With Penn State coming off a loss at Brigham Young two weeks ago, its third loss in the last four games, the Irish could build upon the momentum established by their 54-7 victory over Boston College last week.                    --------------------       Majors Announces Resignation MEMPHIS, Nov. 13 (AP) -- Johnny Majors announced today that after 16 years as Tennessee's head football coach, he was resigning after this season. Majors said he was resigning because "I have not been given the opportunity by the U.T. administration to remain as head football coach past this current season." The leading candidate to replace Majors is his offensive coordinator, Phillip Fulmer, who coached the Vols to a 3-0 record after Majors had heart bypass surgery on Aug. 25.
