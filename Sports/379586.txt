In his Monday Morning QB at Sports Illustrated’s site, Peter King wrote: 1) “If there’s been a story like Tebow’s in the 27 years I’ve covered the NFL, I’m having a hard time recalling it.” 2) “What exactly are we watching here, other than the nuttiest story in recent sports history?” The discrepancy between Tim Tebow’s statistical performances and his results have caused great debate. His passing was better in Denver’s 35-32 victory at Minnesota on Sunday, but by some measures his play was no better than average: From ESPN’s Stats & Info blog: Tim Tebow may not have been towards the top in this Weekâs QBR rating (he is 17th), but he is improving as a passer. Tebowâs passing was much better on Sunday (149.3 NFL passer rating), but he did â and did not – do a lot of things that caused his QBR to be average (49.9). Tebow had no success running the ball as he had zero rushes that went for first downs for the first time as a starter in the NFL. He also took two sacks, one for 10 yards that created a third-and-19 (which they failed to convert) and one that resulted in a fumble that was recovered by the Vikings. On the positive side, Tebow completed 10 of his 15 passes, which was his highest completion percentage in a start ever. At Advanced NFL Stats, Tebow did well in Win Probability Added (he was ranked eighth), but he was middle of the pack in other categories (17th in Expected Points Added and 15th in Success Rate.) That kind of analysis just makes some columnists laugh. “I love it when numbers geeks get involved,” said Greg Couch, writing for Fox Sports: Hereâs the thing: Tebow is the NFLâs Most Valuable Player. Not officially, of course. Itâs just an opinion. No matter what his passer rating is or QBR, or even his technically inept throwing motion — not the way any youth coach would teach — heâs more valuable to his team than any other player in the league. Aaron Rodgers is his closest competition. Tebow comparable to Aaron Rodgers? That probably makes some statistical analysts weep. In any event, Mike Kiszla of The Denver Post sees the phenomenon spreading: “Sorry, Denver. This love affair is bigger than any one city. The Broncos are America’s team now.” King spoke to Tebow after the game but couldn’t get him to share much insight. Tebow did volunteer this, though: “I had an opportunity to talk with a kid named Blake Appleton, from Florida, on Thursday. He’s a leukemia patient who’s just been moved to hospice. And after the game, when I was being interviewed on TV, I got to say his name. That’s what I’m proud of today. I let him know people cared about him. I let him know God has a plan for him.” The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
