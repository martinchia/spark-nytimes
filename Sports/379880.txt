Advertisement By GERALD ESKENAZI ELLIS RUBIN , a Miami-based lawyer with a penchant for high-profile cases, recently went after MERV GRIFFIN in a palimony suit on behalf of BRENT PLOTT . Now Rubin is up against the entire family of STEFFI GRAF . He hopes that a Palm Beach, Fla., judge will grant a restraining order today against "any member of Steffi Graf's family from attacking JIM LEVEE ," Rubin's client. This all goes back to an incident at the French Open on June 6, when Graf's father, PETER GRAF , "smashed Levee on the top of his head with Graf's fist," according to a motion filed 10 days ago in Palm Beach. The motion also asked for protection for JILL GENSON , described as "Levee's companion." Further, the motion contends that Steffi's brother, Michael, also made an "implicit threat" to Levee a month later at Wimbledon. Levee, an heir to the publishing fortune of WALTER ANNENBERG , likes to take young tennis players under his wing. He is famed on the tour for proffering gifts. Rubin concedes that Levee gave Graf, now 22, "Porsches, he gave her jewelry -- not with any romantic intentions." Now, however, Levee has become the patron of 17-year-old MONICA SELES . And Seles and Graf have been battling verbally as well as courtside in recent weeks. Rubin said in the motion that Levee "had not said anything to provoke this physical assault." But in an interview, Rubin admitted that at the French Open, where Levee was seated not far from Graf's father, "Levee said aloud, 'Now you know why Monica is No. 1.' " Rubin, however, added "that remark was not directed to Steffi." We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
