1:51 p.m. | Updated With Game Under Way BALTIMORE â Believe it or not, the soaking rain from this morning has  given way to somewhat overcast skies. Given what has happened the last three days,  this feels like a picture-perfect afternoon. But the forecast has changed as often as  the Yankees must have changed their wet socks recently. A posting more than two hours ago, weather.com said that there was a 20 percent  chance of rain before 5 p.m. Now it says there is a 50 percent chance  of rain at 3 p.m., and a 10 percent chance at 5. In other words, donât bother  checking the hourly forecastÂ often. Although the Yankees escaped waterlogged New York after two long, wet games against the Orioles, they were greeted by more rain at Camden Yards. The remnants of Tropical Storm Lee have lingered far longer than any baseball fan would have liked. Another splashdown could be in store at some point Thursday afternoon, and a delay would be nothing out of the ordinary. The Yankeesâ game against the Orioles on Tuesday was delayed by rain for more than four hours. Then, on Wednesday afternoon, these two teams played a wet and sloppy 11-inning game at Yankee Stadium before departing for Baltimore. Thursdayâs game, coincidentally, is being played to make up the one on Aug. 27 that was postponed because of Hurricane Irene. “We havenât been real fortunate with these hurricanes and these tropical storms,” Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said. “They seem to be hitting higher up the East Coast this year and we have to deal with it. Itâs a rough schedule; thereâs no doubt about it.” The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
