Advertisement  Mke Heath, the Detroit Tiger catcher, was suspended for two games by the American League yesterday for bumping Umpire John Hirschbeck. Heath plans to appeal, however, and can continue playing until a hearing is held. This hearing is expected to take place this week in New York, where the Tigers are playing the Yankees. Heath bumped Hirschbeck while arguing a call in the ninth inning of Detroit's 13-3 loss to Baltimore on July 23.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
