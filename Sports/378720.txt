Free agency officially begins on Fridayth, but the chase has already begun. There are no traditional superstars in the bunch, but the best relative talents will still score max or near-max contracts under the leagueâs new collective bargaining agreement. Hereâs an in-depth look at one of the candidates for such a deal. Marc Gasolâs restricted free agent status makes him a bit more elusive than the other top players on the market, but all things considered, he may be the single most valuable player available. Unlike Nene and Tyson Chandler, Gasolâs career is still in its infancy; heâs played just three N.B.A. seasons to date, and will provide the team that signs him with the prime years of his career. Based on his production thus far, those prime years should be special. According to Basketball-Reference.com, only two active centers posted a better Player Efficiency Rating (P.E.R.) in their first three N.B.A. seasons: Orlando’s Dwight Howard and Minnesotaâs persistently productive Brad Miller. Gasol is ahead of the curve as far as his development goes, and his age (26) isnât a selling point so much as a launch pad for fanciful daydreams. Gasol has become so good so quickly that itâs only natural to wonder just how high he can climb. It certainly doesnât hurt that Gasol is coming off a remarkable playoff run, during which he was able to showcase some impressive flexibility.  A fully functioning N.B.A. offense requires two big men who can play off one another. In that regard, Gasol has certainly had his hands full in his efforts to complement his Grizzlies teammate, Zach Randolph.  Memphis has made Randolph the center of its offensive strategy, but as a big who operates from mid-range as often as he sets up on the block, Randolph puts a lot of pressure on Gasol to rotate between the high and low posts. Thatâs no small task, and yet Gasol has been able to thrive in virtually every capacity: he scores well inside, battles for rebounds (though he still needs improvement in that regard), hits mid-range jumpers reliably, and initiates offense from the elbow. For that reason, Gasol is a great fit for any teamâs half-court offense. He can float between power forward and center and fit seamlessly alongside bigs with more limited skills. That kind of flexibility is valuable considering the crapshoot of free agency; thereâs a random element involved in aligning targeted players with a teamâs cap space, and Gasol makes that process easier by complementing almost any lineup in the league. On top of all of that, Gasol has proven to be an excellent â and equally flexible â team defender. He has become a defensive jack-of-all trades in Memphis, as Gasol often defends the opponentâs best post threat, regularly checks dangerous pick-and-roll players, and is bizarrely comfortable when defending quicker players following a defensive switch. Itâs odd that a lumbering big man like Gasol would appear so natural guarding perimeter players, but heâs able to use angles, length, and effort to prevent penetration and challenge outside shots in a pinch. Even with all of this in mind, there is one legitimate concern: talented young players like Gasol command a lot of money on the basis of their potential alone, and restricted free agency only fuels the possibility that Gasol will receive a bloated contract offer. Memphis reserves the right to match any formal offer that Gasol receives, meaning that an earnest attempt to steal Gasol away from the Grizzlies would require a dollar amount so absurd that Gasolâs current team would be priced out of the running. Memphis will reportedly go to great lengths to retain Gasol, but it would be rather shocking if a team with substantial cap room didnât test the Grizzliesâ resolve. Doing so would require an over-the-top offer hovering around the maximum amount, and while Gasol is a fantastic player, committing that kind of money to a center just three years into his career involves a risk. It may be safe to say that Gasolâs performance thus far has not been the result of some fluke, but a max or near-max offer would assume continued improvement. That shouldnât be much of an issue for a 26-year-old, but thereâs always the possibility â however remote â that Gasol has already made his biggest strides. A versatile 7-footer is worth a pretty penny on the open market, but teams must be careful in striking the delicate balance between paying Gasol for the player he is and overpaying him for the player he could be.
