NEW ORLEANS â After Louisiana State lost to Alabama on Monday in the Bowl Championship Series title game, Tigers Coach Les Miles and two players climbed a podium for their news conference. It started like most news conferences do, in that key figures were there to answer questions and reporters were there to ask them. After Miles made an opening statement, the moderator opened the floor to questions. The first came from Bobby Hebert, a local broadcaster and former Saints quarterback, whose son, T-Bob Hebert, plays center and guard for L.S.U. Hebert started, according to the transcript: âCoach, did you ever consider bringing in Jarrett Lee, considering that you werenât taking any chances on the field? Now, I know Alabamaâs defense is dominant. But, come on, thatâs ridiculous, five first downs. I mean, so itâs almost an approach, Iâll tell you from the fansâ standpoint, that how can you not maybe push the ball down the field and bring in Jarrett Lee?â In the often mundane world of post-event news conferences, where coaches spew clichÃ©s and reporters worry about deadlines, this rant, in all its fan-like anger â from a broadcaster to the man who coached his son â registered somewhere near the level of âbombshell,â as the room fell silent and faces filled with shock.  In theory, such news conferences are supposed to be attended by objective reporters, which doesnât mean that always happens. But even then, this was unusual, too. In the press room after the game, talk of Hebertâs lack of decorum dominated conversation more than Alabamaâs transcendent championship performance. Lee served as the Tigers’ quarterback for much of the season, when Jordan Jefferson, who played all of the game Monday, was suspended for his alleged role in a bar fight. Lee, in the Tigersâ locker room Monday, said he âthought I might getâ a chance to play when Jefferson and the L.S.U. offense remained stagnant from the first half into the second. But that, of course, never happened. So back to Hebert. He continued with his âquestion,â later, again according to the transcript, adding, âI know the pass rush of Alabama, but thereâs no reason why in five first downs â¦ you have a great defense, L.S.U. is a great defense, but thatâs ridiculous.â At that point, the moderator interrupted, asking, âDo you have a question?â Hebert responded: âThatâs the question. Do you think you should have pushed the football more down field?â Miles answered: âI think if you watch our calls that we did throw the football down the field. We didnât necessarily get the football down the field.â Shortly afterward, Miles said he did consider playing Lee, who was replaced by Jefferson after L.S.U. beat Alabama earlier this season, despite a poor offensive output. Hebert, meanwhile, and his son were profiled this week by the local newspaper, The Times-Picayune. In the story, it said, âThe former Saints quarterback is now a broadcaster for WWL-AM sports shows, often sounding more like a caller than a host.â In fact, there are other documented incidents of Hebert blurring, or crossing, the line between fan and journalist. In a Dec. 2009 post on the Web site Pro Football Talk, Hebert is cited as celebrating a Saintsâ touchdown in one press box and âgiving Bud Adams a few ideasâ in another. Then came the news conference on Monday night. Before most, if not all, sporting events, officials make an announcement. It usually goes something like, âThere is no cheering in the press box.â Itâs understood that the same goes for ranting in a news conference. But not on Monday night, as this Herbert rant will perhaps live longer than what most saw as a boring game.
