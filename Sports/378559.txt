 Lance Armstrong talked for several hours with cycling investigators about doping in the sport’s past, said Elliot R. Peters, a lawyer for Armstrong. Peters said Armstrong, who was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles over his use of performance-enhancing drugs, set up the meeting and sat for questions for seven hours on May 22 at a hotel near Dulles International Airport outside Washington. A version of this brief appears in print on July 18, 2014, on Page B14 of the New York edition with the headline: Armstrong Spoke to Investigators.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
