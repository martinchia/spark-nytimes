Advertisement By THOMAS GEORGE National Football League financial documents released at the N.F.L. Federal antitrust trial over free agency show that in the four years before the league signed its $3.6 billion television contract, the dominant team of the 80's was also the biggest financial failure. The San Francisco 49ers, Super Bowl winners in the 1988 and '89 seasons, prided themselves on their first-class travel, facilities and salaries. The documents show that from the 1986 through 1989 seasons, the 49ers and their owner, Eddie DeBartolo, paid dearly for those amenities, posting $31.2 million in operating losses in that span and suffering a huge one-year loss of $14.033 million in 1989. The Philadelphia Eagles, who posted a regular-season record of 33-31-1 and wore no Super Bowl rings in that four-year span, were the league's leaders in profits, posting a total gain of $28.7 million, including a bonanza of $8.686 million in 1989. The documents, which were made public this week, were requested during discovery by lawyers for the eight players who brought the suit against the league. The presiding judge, David Doty, ordered the league to supply the records, but the evidence remained sealed until Judge Doty granted a request by The Associated Press and The Star Tribune of Minneapolis to make it public. The information provides details on team spending, including salaries of coaches, owners and front-office personnel. No player salaries were filed, but several players' contracts have been dissected as exhibits during the opening weeks of the trial, which began in mid-June.  No Clear Pattern Advertisement The developing financial picture shows no clear pattern for success, but reveals wide disparities in spending from team to team. Advertisement In 1989, for example, the 49ers ran up $11.6 million in team expenses and the Eagles $4.4 million; the 49ers spent $8.5 million in general and administrative costs, the Eagles $2.9 million; the 49ers spent $2.2 million in public relations, the Eagles $711,000; and the 49ers spent $27.5 million in player costs, the Eagles $21.4 million. During the four-season span, eight teams suffered operating losses each season (San Francisco, Dallas, Cleveland, New England, the Jets, the Raiders, the Giants and Kansas City) and nine teams, led by the Eagles, gained money each year. Included in that group were two of the league's most consistent losers, Indianapolis ($14.2 million earned) and Tampa Bay ($13.9 million). Indianapolis was 27-34 during those seasons; Tampa Bay was 16-47.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

The income figures for the last two seasons were not available, and they could provide a drastically different financial landscape, especially considering each team's share in the first two years of the record TV pact. In 1992, each team will get $34.5 million in TV income and in 1993 that rises to $40 million per team. It is reasonable to project that most of the nine teams with four consecutive profitable seasons before the TV deal are faring well now and, thus, could lead the battle for signing free agents if the players win their freedom at the trial. This argument is being used by both sides in the trial: the N.F.L contends that profitable teams would dominate in signing players and create competitive imbalance. The players disagree and contend that competitive balance would be enhanced because all teams would be forced to spend more wisely and teams like Tampa Bay and Indianapolis would be forced to sign better players. The documents disclosed other intriguing patterns: *Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson was the league's highest-paid coach in 1990, a year after his team went 1-15, with a salary of $1.433 million, but Dan Reeves of Denver was not far behind. Reeves earned $850,000 in 1989 and likely more than that in each of his last two seasons. Reeves explained that his contract insures that he must remain among the top five paid coaches in the league. He also receives attractive bonuses: a $42,000 country club membership in Denver, 20 season tickets to Bronco games and a $4.5 million life insurance policy. *The N.F.L. began as family-owned businesses -- the Maras with the Giants, the Halases with the Bears -- and many teams today pay their families from team earnings though, in some instances, it is unclear for what services. The Bears' McCaskey family, for example, in each of the last four years has paid "other family" $94,000, $96,000, $99,000 and $103,000. The Rankin Smith Sr. family of the Atlanta Falcons tops the list with payments from '87 through '90 to "other family" of $418,000, $454,000, $493,00 and $526,000. That was after Smith himself took an average salary of $530,000 in each of those years. *From 1987 through 1991, based on a document that provided overall league figures but no team-by-team breakdown, N.F.L. ticket sales grew by 56.8 percent, TV revenues (local and network) grew by 101 percent and total revenues grew by 74 percent. By contrast, player costs grew by 66.4 percent and non-player costs grew by just 27 percent. It appears, then, that teams managed non-player costs efficiently but that player costs soared.

By contrast, player costs rose by 190 percent and non- player costs increased by 105 percent. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
