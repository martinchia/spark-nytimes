Chile scored two quick goals to jump out to an early lead and held on against Australia for the victory in the teams’ opening Group B match.




90+4 Chile puts it away
 That’s it. The final goal puts a sheen of respectability on Chile’s night. They’ve got the points and three goals. Give some credit to the Socceroos, who silenced the jokesters and made a pretty good game of it. And, for once, we’re not moaning about the referee. Chile heads to the Maracana for a BIG match against Spain on Wednesday, while Australia plays the Netherlands in Porto Alegre. That’s it from me. We’ll be back tomorrow morning with Greece-Colombia, and I’ll be popping in for the nightcap between Japan and the Ivory Coast. Enjoy your evening.    Beausejour, who’s spent most of his time sending in crosses to no-one, finally connects from distance. Pinilla fired at Ryan from point-blank range, the ball rebounded to Beausejour, who cracked in a shot from 22 yards. Game over.

We’re entering the final stages here, and it’s hard to see anything breaking the pattern of Chile’s genteel “after you” attacking policy, and Australia’s huffing and puffing. Chile’s had pretty much all the possession, but, he wrote, dusting off the cliche, lack penetration in the final third. James Troisi, of the A-League’s Melbourne Victory, replaces the excellent Mark Bresciano. Defensive move here for Chile as Jorge ValdÃ­via makes way for Jean Beausejour. Ben Halloran comes on for Tommy Oar, who’s worked his socks off tonight. Mark Milligan clips the heel of Alexis Sanchez and works his way into the book. Wilkinson scrapes away a ball that was trundling over the line from the foot of Vargas. Hurrah for goalline technology, though — it’s not over the line. Something that was apparent to, well, pretty much everyone.  Bresciano continues his Rip Van Winkle of a second half and pushes another shot wide. Arturo Vidal, who’s looked off the pace, makes way for Felipe Gutierrez. Mile Jedinak subjects Alexis Sanchez to some rough treatment and earns a caution.  Mark Bresciano rolls back the years, meeting a cross from the left with a fine shot that Bravo can only parry. Bresciano steers the rebound against Bravo and into the side-netting. This isn’t over. Chile’s approach work is beautiful and frequently ties the Australian defense in knots. Trouble is, nobody seems keen enough to pull the trigger. Australia have no such inhibitions. Cahill has the ball in the back of the net on a breakaway, but he’s offside. Franjic, who tweaked a hamstring a few minutes ago, is replaced by China-based defender Ryan McGowan. This is his first international cap.  During open play, Cahill fluffs a header wide, and appeals in vain for a penalty. We’re back. Australia kicks off. No changes for either team, it would seem. This will be a big 45 minutes for both teams.    Want to enjoy more World Cup coverage? Sign up for daily World Cup 2014 updates from Brazil. The photo firehose is ON now at the World Cup. Endless stream of images. //t.co/zAUdvhZbk5 — NYT Sports (@NYTSports) June 13, 2014  Chile started very brightly, scoring twice in the early going. But then they took the foot off the pedal and allowed Australia back into the game. The Socceroos may be limited technically, but they are spirited and won’t roll over too easily for anyone. Cahill’s header, a looping effort, was a fine strike.     Vidal, who looks a little rusty tonight, fouls a streaking Davidson. It’s Cahill who gets the yellow, though, for  dissent. Maybe he’s a bit too up for it. Tim Cahill’s goal tonight means that he has scored in three different World Cups. He looks up for it this evening, and is giving Gary Medel, in particular, a stern examination       New York Red Bulls’ own Tim Cahill leaps above Medel to head home Franjic’s cross from the right. Oddly for Cahill, he declines to rough up the corner flag. Game on!  Matthew Leckie reminds us there are two teams out  here with a good run down the right. The ball sails wide though.  If Socceroos are just going to surrender, they should have gone with all white tonight. #AUS #CHI â Andrew Das (@AndrewDasNYT) June 13, 2014  It's tomorrow in Australia so it means the game is already over. — JackBell (@JackBell) June 13, 2014  Chile, on the attack, is really something to watch. The players swarm forward and swamp defenders with pressure and rapid movement. Australia looks like they learned soccer on a different planet at the moment. This could get ugly fast. Play the World Cup drinking game. We suggest water or soy milk //t.co/nVPq8PQsfO pic.twitter.com/uA46oWNWkN — NYT Sports (@NYTSports) June 13, 2014  More chaos from the Socceroos. Sanchez provides an opening for Valdivia to blast home a shot from the edge of the area. Sanchez takes advantage from some chaotic defending by Australia, squeezing in a shot at the near post from six yards, after Aranguiz and Vargas create the opening. For Australia … it was nice while it lastd. Alexis Sanchez. So we’ve settled into a rhythm here. Chile is playing a very high line, while Australia uses every opportunity to launch long balls up to Tim Cahill — who probably won’t be able to do this over 90 minutes — and Tommy Oar to chase. All yellow for Socceroos tonight. Brave. Bold. Bananas. — Andrew Das (@AndrewDasNYT) June 13, 2014  Chile and its fans take a leaf out of Brazil’s playbook, with a stirring rendition of the national anthem — twice. Second go-round is a capella with a boisterous crowd singing along.  Australia gives it a try, but there’s really no contest. Want to enjoy more World Cup coverage?

Paul the octopus predicted Spain would win the World Cup in 2010, but in 1950, no one could have predicted the United States teamâs victory over one of the best soccer squads in the world. Fans of English soccer will be familiar with Gary Medel and Mile Jedinak, who play for Cardiff City and Crystal Palace, respectively. Medel played midfield for Cardiff but will switch to central defense for Chile, while Jedinak heads from the backline to midfield for the Socceroos. So, how’s your World Cup bracket looking now? We heard a lot about cat-and-mouse, chess on grass, and great tactical battles in the lead-up to Spain-Netherlands. What we got was a good old fashion tonking, starring Robin and, er, Robben. Who saw that one coming? Which means we’re destined for a scoreless tie tonight, right? Actually, probably not. The good news for Chile is that Arturo Vidal is fit to start, while Alexis Sanchez, who’s apparently surplus to requirements at Barcelona, can add a few zeroes to his transfer fee with a good performance. Chileâs high pressing, all-out attack has made La Roja pre-tournament media darlings. The Chileans breezed through South American qualifying with a free-scoring style, thanks to the finishing of Alexis Sanchez and the all-round play of Arturo Vidal. Australia is making its third straight World Cup appearance, but only 34-year-old Tim Cahill and the injury-prone Mark Bresciano remain from the golden generation that shone at the 2006 tournament.
