A.F.C.

N.F.C.





6. New York Jets @ 3. Indianapolis Colts


They met in the A.F.C. championship game last year, but not much is the same. The Jetsâ defense isnât as dominant as it was, and neither is the Coltsâ offense. Indianapolis has found a run defense, and in recent weeks Mark Sanchez has shown flashes of a passing game. Still, this game will come down to the same thing it always does with the Colts: can the opponent score as many points as they can? Even in a season when most of his favorite receivers were hurt, Peyton Manning still has his team ranked fourth in points scored. In previous years, Indianapolis wouldnât have struggled to beat the Titans, as it did Sunday, but this is still a team that rides on Manningâs shoulders, and there are a lot worse places to be.
The Jets are far less predictable. The final preseason-like game against the Bills aside, itâs difficult to forecast which team will show up: the one that struggled to score points against the Packers, the Patriots and the Dolphins, or the one that put up 22 on the Steelers and 34 on the Bears. Only two of the Jetsâ victories came against playoff teams â their early-season win over the Patriots and their late-season one against the Steelers. But if the Jetsâ secondary can intercept Manning and if their running backs can get traction, they may be able to avoid a shootout.

Players to Watch: Manning will be Manning, but he will be throwing to a largely untested group of receivers. Jacob Tamme and Blair White will be playing in the biggest game of their careers, and how they react under stress could determine if the Colts advance.



5. Baltimore Ravens @ 4. Kansas City Chiefs


Are there two teams feeling worse as they enter the playoffs? The Chiefs were demolished at home by Oakland on Sunday and the Ravens were lifeless in a win over Cincinnati. These are strikingly similar teams: run intensive, reliant on defense, sporadic with offensive explosions. As bad as the Chiefsâ loss to the Raiders was, the Ravens might have suffered more: offensive tackle Michael Oher, cornerback Josh Wilson and safety Ed Reed were injured, problematic because their secondary is already shaky.
Both teams will try to run; the Chiefs have been a bit vulnerable up the middle, so watch for Ray Rice to go there. Both teams will play bruising defense. Points will be at a premium and so will big plays. But if they happen, they will probably come from the Ravensâ side. The Ravens hoped to be a top-five offense this season and instead are 20th, but Joe Flacco has better receivers than Matt Cassel does. The Chiefsâ offense entered the final week of the season with the top-ranked running game but the 28th-ranked passing game. That makes this a difficult matchup against the leagueâs fourth-ranked run defense. Kansas City is not built to come from behind. If the Ravens put up points early, as they did against the Patriots in the wild-card round last year, the Chiefs could be in trouble.

Players to Watch:  If the Ravens bottle up running back Jamaal Charles, it will fall to Cassel to attack Baltimoreâs cornerbacks. Cassel had a superb season (27 touchdowns, 5 interceptions) until Sunday, when he had no touchdown passes and threw two interceptions.

First-Round Byes

New England Patriots: Still thinking about last year, when the Patriots lost at home to the Ravens in the first round of the playoffs? Forget it. The Patriots are the best team in the N.F.L. right now, and the competition is not terribly close. Their defense makes big plays; their offense is frighteningly efficient. They lead the league in scoring and turnover differential. They are relatively healthy and have won eight in a row. The bye will let running back Danny Woodhead heal from the hit to the head he took Sunday and will allow a host of players who got Sunday off to get ready. Then, watch out, A.F.C. New England beat four of the other five playoff teams this season. Only Kansas City escaped, and its turn could be coming. 

Pittsburgh Steelers: The Steelers may have hastened Eric Manginiâs departure from Cleveland on Sunday, but their more immediate reward is the most-needed bye week of any  playoff team. Safety Troy Polamalu played Sunday â he had an interception â but his Achillesâ needs more rest. (Remember, the Jets beat the Steelers in Pittsburgh when Polamalu was out two weeks ago). Ben Roethlisberger has been battered behind an injury-riddled offensive line. Still, the only team to make the Steelers look bad this season was the Patriots, who scored 39 points in Pittsburgh. The rematch would be for the A.F.C. championship. 







6. Green Bay Packers @ 3. Philadelphia Eagles


These teams opened against each other, with the Packers winning in Philadelphia, 27-20. Ah, but what a difference 16 weeks make. That was the game that gave the N.F.L. an inkling of what was to come with Michael Vick, who threw for 175 yards and ran for 104 in relief of the injured Kevin Kolb. Green Bay had 132 yards rushing in that game, but since then the Packers have abandoned the run so completely that they did not even try to punch it in from third and short against the Bears on Sunday. The Packers are relying on defense to win games. Really.
The onus will be on Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers because it is clear that the Packers have no confidence in a rushing offense that was ranked 22nd in the league entering the final weekend. Their passing game was ranked fifth, though, and even though they were not on their game Sunday, Rodgers completed just enough deep passes to keep his team upright. If the Packersâ defense canât contain Vick, expect pinball numbers on the scoreboard.
The book on Vick is to hit him, and to get him to move to his right. If the Packersâ defense plays the way it did against the Bears, Vick could get beaten up badly. But Green Bay will have to account for far more dangerous  playmakers than the ones it faced against Chicago. DeSean Jackson is an electric receiver, LeSean McCoy an explosive runner.


Players to Watch: Would you take your eyes off Vick? Of course not.



5. New Orleans Saints @ 4. Seattle Seahawks


You have to wonder if the Saints even bothered to stay awake to see who won the N.F.C. West on Sunday night. This game may stand as the best evidence for reseeding playoff teams according to number of victories and not division championships.
Ignore the Saintsâ season-ending loss to the Buccaneers â they knew early in the game they couldnât improve their seeding because Atlanta was blowing out Carolina.
More revealing was the Saintsâ comeback victory in Atlanta last week. That game summed up the Saintsâ season nicely â a few mind-boggling mistakes, even by quarterback Drew Brees, and then some eye-popping plays, also by Brees. That performance, in a high-profile game that meant so much to the Falcons, signaled that the Saints were rounding into postseason form. The Seahawks, meanwhile, might have a bright future. But they are, at the core, a losing team â the first one to win a division in a full season.
The Saints entered the final week of the season with the leagueâs second-ranked passing game, and they routed the Seahawks (34-19)  in November. There is no way to imagine the Seahawksâ offense, 28th in the league entering the final game, staying with the Saints, particularly because their 29th-ranked pass defense is likely to get shredded by the Saintsâ aggressive passing game. In their regular-season game, the Saints had 494 yards of offense.

Players to Watch: An improved running game would help the Saintsâ long-term playoff hopes, but letâs keep it simple this week: just watch Brees do his thing.

First-Round Byes

Atlanta Falcons: The Falcons were dominant at home all season, except for the loss that may linger the most. With a chance to do serious damage to the Saints in Week 16, the Falcons had the lead but could not finish New Orleans. Maybe it was just an off night, but a loss like that, on national television, has to sting. The bye gives them a chance to focus on a problem that needs a solution. All the Falconsâ losses exposed a weakness: when running back Michael Turner is shut down, the offense falters. Still, without a dominant, Patriots-like team in the N.F.C., Atlanta, which has lost just two games at home in the Matt Ryan era, has to feel good about getting to the championship game. 

Chicago Bears: The Patriots provided the blueprint on how to beat the Bears: lots of short passes to take advantage of the middle ground yielded by the Cover 2 defense. But the game to pay attention to could be Chicagoâs late November victory over Philadelphia, a likely playoff opponent. The Bears have proved to be surprisingly productive in terms of points, and quarterback Jay Cutler has proved less mistake-prone than he was early in the season. The bye gives the Bears one more week as the most under-the-radar team in the playoffs, and it lets wide receiver Earl Bennett (ankle) and linebacker Pisa Tinoisamoa (knee) recuperate.
