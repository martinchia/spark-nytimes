 Lamar Odom’s brief venture into European basketball has been cut short by a back injury, according to his Spanish club. The club, Baskonia, said that Odom’s personal doctors in New York had ruled him unfit to play for two months, meaning he had “finished his present contract.” Odom, 34, signed a two-month deal with the team last month and played a total of 23 minutes in two games, scoring 2 points. ■ The United States women’s national basketball team was placed in a pool with Serbia, China and Angola for the opening round of the world championship in Istanbul, which starts on Sept. 27. A version of this brief appears in print on March 16, 2014, on Page SP10 of the New York edition with the headline: Odom Finished in Spain.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
