Thank goodness the United States Open womenâs final is here, because the well on adjectives to describe Serena Williams is running dry. Her dismantling of fifth-seeded Li Na in the semifinals Friday was surgical in its precision. The first set, which the top-seeded Williams won at love, took 29 minutes. In the second set, Li briefly made it a match. She held her serve, then broke Williamsâs and was one point from a 3-1 lead when Williams roared back, winning that game and four of the next five. The difference was not necessarily Williamsâs baseline power or sizzling serve. She scored only four aces in the match and ended up with more unforced errors than winners. But Williams consistently hit one more shot than Li, finding the line when she needed it, scoring an ace when momentum seemed to be swinging the other way. The scary thing for Victoria Azarenka as she faces Williams for the championship Sunday is that Li did not play badly and still lost.  As has been the case throughout the tournament, the second-seeded Azarenka was far from her best against Flavia Pennetta in the other womenâs semifinal. Azarenka started well, breaking Pennetta in the first game. But in a pattern that repeated itself throughout the match, Azarenka handed the lead back by losing her serve in a game that included two double faults. Over all, there were 13 breaks of serve, eight by Azarenka, and far more points ended with errors than with winners. That may have been good enough against the unseeded Pennetta, but it will not be against Williams.  The rematch of their 2012 womenâs final, which Williams pulled out in three sets, should not be a rout. This year, Azarenka defeated Williams twice on hardcourts and lost to her once on clay. Williams, however, is playing at a higher level now. This match should feature some great backcourt rallies, but expect Williams to win in straight sets for her 17th career Grand Slam singles title. As a postscript, shortly after Li match, the commentator John McEnroe posed this question: Are we watching not only the best player in this tournament, but also the best ever, in Williams? Itâs an impossible question to answer now. But with a win Sunday, Williams would be one Grand Slam singles title from tying Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert for second place on the career list. Williams has earned the right to be discussed among the best female players in tennis history. Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
