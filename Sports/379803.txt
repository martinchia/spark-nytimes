Mark Cuban is a big baseball fan with a lot of discretionary income who would love the chance to own a major league franchise. But not now and not the Mets. âIâm not chasing any more baseball teams,â Cuban, the billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said Wednesday before his team played the Knicks at Madison Square Garden. For Cuban, this is a case of been there, done that â twice. Over the past four years, he has entered the bidding for the Chicago Cubs and the Texas Rangers, only to walk away frustrated each time. Cuban said he had âlearned my lesson,â which was, simply: âNot to be everyone elseâs stalking horse. Just using me to drive up the price.â Now, he said, he would pursue another franchise only if a team reached out to him. âIâve just come to the conclusion, if Iâm going to write a huge check, Iâd ratherâ be wooed âthan have to chase,â Cuban said.

The distressed Mets do not seem to be on Cubanâs radar. He said he knew little about the recent decision by the owners Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz to sell up to 25 percent of the club â or about the lawsuit against them filed by a trustee representing the victims of Bernard L. Madoffâs Ponzi scheme. Cuban said he could not speculate about how the lawsuit might affect a sale. âBecause people can file lawsuits for any number of a thousand reasons,â he said. âYou just donât know whatâs real, whatâs not real, whether itâs the trustee just doing it just because he has to do it; itâs on his checklist and otherwise heâll look bad. And it could be a P.R. thing for the trustee. I donât know any of the details at all.â The decision by the Metsâ owners to sell only a minority share would discourage a potential investor like Cuban, who wants full control of a team. But he said he could envision someone who wants to become an owner solely for âvanity purposesâ buying a 25 percent share. A lifelong fan of the Pittsburgh Pirates, his hometown team, Cuban said he could recall where he was when the Atlanta Bravesâ Sid Bream slid across home plate to beat the Pirates in Game 7 of the 1992 National League Championship Series. âI was in Barcelona, Spain, and I was listening on Armed Forces Radio,â he said. He said he heard âabout 100 times a dayâ from Pirates fans who want him to buy the team. But baseball ownership remains a distant fantasy for now. Cuban seemed confident, however, that the Mets would have no trouble finding eager investors. âI certainly havenât looked at their books or anything,â Cuban said. âBut itâs a great franchise in a great market. So Iâm sure thereâs going to be a whole lot of interest. But whether itâs here or the Dodgers, for that matter, Iâm not going to put myself in a bidding situation.â The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
