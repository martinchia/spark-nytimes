 Julián Arredondo won the 18th stage of the Giro d’Italia, and Nairo Quintana retained the overall leader’s pink jersey as the race returned to the mountains. Arredondo, 25, had been part of a breakaway and made his move with a little less than four kilometers (2.5 miles) remaining to ride alone up the summit finish to Rifugio Panarotta. He finished 17 seconds ahead of Fabio Duarte at the end of the 171-kilometer (106-mile) leg from Belluno. Quintana remained 1 minute 41 seconds ahead of Rigoberto Urán, with Pierre Rolland moving into third. A version of this brief appears in print on May 30, 2014, on Page B10 of the New York edition with the headline: Quintana Stays in Front.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
