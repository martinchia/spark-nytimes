Saturday brings the biggest game of the Spanish season — maybe of the European season — so far, as Barcelona travels to the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in the capital to take on Real Madrid. Jake Applemans previews the game, and the seismic shift it could signal. Barcelona has won three straight titles in La Liga, but with a victory on Saturday and again next week, Real Madrid could take a seemingly insurmountable 9-point lead into the winter break: Real Madrid has generally performed admirably in La Liga during Barcelonaâs title-collecting run. It even compiled its best-ever record while finishing second in 2010. But its stunning form this season reflects a higher level of play. Some have credited Manager JosÃ© Mourinhoâs newfound ability to refrain from generating excess drama, although it remains to be seen if Mourinhoâs good behavior merely stems from time away from coaching against Barcelona. Richard Fitzpatrick takes a look at the undercurrent of racism that has often reared its head in Spanish soccer. Unnoticed outside Spain in many cases, it regularly makes headlines when taunts and chants surface in the high-profile, blood-boiling matchups that make up the clÃ¡sico: There is an ugly subtext, however, to Saturdayâs matchup, because the rivalry has produced a series of racial incidents, the most recent one coming in the last game played between these two teams, in August. That game was the second leg of the Spanish Super Cup and Barcelona, playing at home, won by 3-2, and by 5-4 on aggregate. In the third minute of injury time, Real Madridâs Marcelo, a black Brazilian player who sports a shaggy Afro, hacked down the Barcelona newcomer Cesc FÃ bregas. The referee immediately drew a red card even as monkey chants again began to echo around the 100,000-seat Camp Nou stadium. This was nothing new. What are you expecting from Saturday’s game? Barcelona Manager Pep Guardiola acknowledged Friday that his team was a deserved underdog for a change, saying, “We have more at stake, and whoever is behind in the standings always feels a little more pressure.” Has Real Madrid not only closed the gap on Barcelona, but now nudged ahead? And has the rivalry been taken over by pressure and emotions in a way that is unhealthy? Share your thoughts in the comments.
