I have always been a better reader than athlete, and as a teenager, I imagined that I could improve my golf game just from studying a book, âFive Lessons: The Modern Fundamentals of Golf,â by Ben Hogan. It took me years, during which I may have done myself permanent damage, before I realized that the Hogan swing, with its emphasis on pronation (whatever that is) and rapidly unwinding the hips, only makes sense if youâre Ben Hogan. If youâre me â and if youâre you, probably â the Hogan swing works about as well as a car engine that has thrown a rod. Nevertheless, for years, I depended on written golf instruction, especially the âtipsâ that appear all the time in golf magazines: pretend your arms are swinging a bucket of water, pretend youâre throwing a medicine ball, pretend thereâs a rope connecting your left arm to your left knee and a string connecting the bill of your cap to your crotch. I looked forward to those monthly homilies about golf self-betterment the way a wino looks forward to his next pint of muscatel. Just recently, though, I discovered video instruction. There is a ton of this stuff on YouTube, and there are also a lot of golf instructors who will e-mail you a free daily hint or video lesson in hopes of getting you to sign up for a more expensive program. How useful are these videos? Well, there was one a friend recommended to me not long ago. It explains that there are 24 basic components to the golf swing, each with 12 or 15 variations, and that the most important thing is to front-load your feet so that you can snap-load your power package and amplify the lag and the drag pressure through impact. Simple! That particular video is a parody, as I eventually realized, but it points to one of the pitfalls of video instruction. There is a lot of confusing, even contradictory information out there. For a while, I was receiving e-mails from a guy who wanted me to hinge my wrists before even taking the club back. The hinging business has to happen sooner or later, his philosophy seemed to be, so why not get it over with? Lately, Iâve been hearing from a guy named C. J., who wants me to think about hinging as soon as the club is waist high, but there are also guys out there on the Internet who think you should delay the hinge as long as possible to create a wider arc. After trying it various ways, I think the answer is to try to forget that you even have wrists. Pretend that there are just stumps there at the end of your arms.  But what do you do about your shoulders? Big turn or small? I used to get e-mails all the time from a pro named Don Trahan, a k a Surge â short for Swing Surgeon â who has apparently given up on me, because I failed to send him money or because he heard what a mess I had made of his swing system. (âSomething wrong?â one of my playing partners said. âAre you hurt?â) Like a lot of Internet instructors, Surge recommends an abbreviated turn and a three-quarter-length backswing, on the principle that the average golfer isnât flexible enough to rotate his back more than that and is less apt to hurt himself this way. And that the shorter the swing is, the less chance there is (theoretically) for something to go wrong. My new friend Paul over at Revolution Golf, on the other hand, wants me to turn and coil until I feel my left side stretch like a rubber band. Heâs a young guy; I donât think he knows just how old and brittle a rubber band can get. And then there are your hips. Do you fire them, as Hogan suggested, and (unless you are Hogan) risk the dread spinout? Or do you hold them back, trapping the club behind you? No matter what you do, youâre probably going to hit the ball to the left or the right but not down the middle. So it seems to me that the best approach is to have an epidural injection shortly before teeing off and, like someone giving birth, lose sensation in the pelvic region altogether. As far as I know, this is not against the rules of golf, though you would probably need to take a cart. Speaking of hips,Tom Watson, in his new DVD, âLessons of a Lifetime,â suggests what feels like a weirdly contorted posture for making chip shots. You take an open stance, with the left foot (if youâre a right-handed golfer) dropped back, but then you turn your hips back to your right as if being ratcheted by a torque wrench. Amazingly, it works â and come to think of it, so do most of the other golf tips that feel all wrong. Thatâs a tip that you heard right here: if something feels natural, forget it. Of all the instructional videos Iâve seen, âLessons of a Lifetime,â which I bought after interviewing Watson last year, is by far the most reassuring. There he is, the ageless boy from Kansas City with the Tom Sawyer grin, saying, âLetâs see what happens,â after outlining the three or four steps necessary for executing some impossible feat â a downhill bunker shot, say, from a buried lie. He swings that still-effortless-and-silky swing and â swish! â the ball winds up a foot from the cup. âAnd you can do it, too,â he says, looking into the camera. Probably not, but the vote of confidence is nice to hear. Another useful DVD is âThe Next Generation,â by Sean Foley, whom I also interviewed not long ago. Foley is Tiger Woodsâs new swing coach, and he has been unfairly accused of messing up Woodsâs swing by smuggling in some elements of the controversial stack-and-tilt technique, in which, contrary to received wisdom, the right-handed golfer keeps his weight on the left side while turning back. There is no stack-and-tilt on the video, though Foley does insist â again, contrary to traditional thinking â that the club head faces right at impact on a draw shot and faces left for a fade. Hereâs another good tip: pretty much everything you thought you knew is wrong. Foley is also more discouraging than Watson, pointing out that you need to practice his various drills 100 times a day for a month or so. What we tip-addicts yearn for instead are quick fixes so. much as we might wish to, we donât have to quit our jobs to get better at golf. What I like about Foleyâs DVD is its notion that to improve your game, you need to trick your brain. For example, he suggests that you practice your swing while standing on two wobbly foam pads or on a treacherous domelike device that resembles something circus acrobats might use. You get your brain so worried about keeping your balance, his theory seems to be, that when you step back down on the ground, your mind is lulled into smoothness. This fits perfectly with a long-held notion of mine that to play a really good round, you need to sneak up on your brain before it knows what youâre doing â perhaps by playing while hung over or before youâre fully awake. On the other hand, Foleyâs philosophy fails to address a recent observation by a friend of mine, a very good golfer who taught himself to be an exceptional putter only to discover that his chipping game had deserted him almost entirely. His hypothesis is that at a certain age, you have only so many golfing neurons at your disposal, and that you can build new neuronal pathways only by tearing old ones down and using them for parts. The way I like to look at it, the golf swing is an immensely complicated mechanism, not unlike one of those big construction cranes you see erecting buildings in New York. Your brain is the cab, way up at the top, with all those knobs, levers and foot pedals. And what all my instruction watching has taught me is that in the past, I have relied too much on whatever operator the union decided to send to run the machinery: twitchy one day, smooth and fluid on another. Every so often, though, heâs just plain inept, a guy merely punching the clock and waiting for his pension. You have to sneak up on that guy, bump him out of the seat and take over your own controls. But you have to memorize the manual, or at least watch the video version, beforehand. You canât keep it open on your lap.
