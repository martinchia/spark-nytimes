Itâs pretty well established that walking does more for your golf game than riding in a cart. And obviously, it offers more exercise. There is the rare case, however, in which riding in a cart might give you the chance to run for your life. According to a story in The Baxter Bulletin of northwestern Arkansas, an exploding golf cart interrupted a golfer as he was playing the seventh hole at the Rivercliff Golf Course in Bull Shoals in mid-February. The cart was acting up and witnesses said they heard some popping noises. Then there was an explosion and fire, according to the newspaper, which quoted the course owner and local fire chief. There were no serious injuries. The blaze burned the cart to its metal frame and set the fairway on fire. The flames advanced to some nearby woods before being extinguished. The cartâs occupant, Jimmy Sanders, sustained a minor burn to his hand. That happened, of course, when Sanders retrieved his golf clubs from the back of the cart. The newspaper did not elaborate on whether Sanders finished his round. Iâm guessing he did. And Iâm guessing he walked.
