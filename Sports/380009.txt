Advertisement  The way BRIAN BOSWORTH is telling it, what persuaded him to sign a 10-year contract with the Seattle Seahawks in 1987 wasn't just the $11 million the contract would pay him, but the team's assurances that it would also maintain large policies to insure him in the event of injury. Sure enough, the linebacker was injured, and after missing parts of three seasons, failed his training-camp physical last year. Now Bosworth says that the team did not live up to its agreement; he accused the club of not making payments on some of the policies it had taken out and of failing to diligently pursue claims under the ones it did maintain. As a result, Bosworth has filed suit in Federal court in Seattle against the Seahawks and Lloyd's of London, which he says has avoided making payment on $5.1 million in claims.
