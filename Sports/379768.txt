GLENDALE, Ariz. â Zack Greinke made his first exhibition appearance for the Milwaukee Brewers on Tuesday, walking three of his eight hitters but not feeling too bad about it. He missed with a few high fastballs, and is learning a different curveball grip. His side muscle bothers him a little, but he said it was improving. The ball felt good leaving his hand. We know this because Greinke spoke with reporters after facing the Chicago White Sox at Camelback Ranch. It was one of the rare times we get to hear from Greinke, who speaks to reporters only after he pitches, the ground rules for someone who has dealt with social-anxiety disorder.
 By many accounts, Greinke is a fascinating guy, blunt in his answers, not concerned with public reaction. At the Brewersâ fan fest in late January, he actually predicted that Pittsburgh would beat Green Bay in the Super Bowl. So much for that. A handful of out-of-town writers covered his start on Tuesday, including one from Kansas City, where he pitched until his trade to the Brewers this winter. Greinke laughed when he recognized the Kansas City writer, and made him repeat his question. Greinke was not really interested in revisiting his departure from Kansas City, but over 18 casual, fairly relaxed minutes with the news media, he explained why he believed he had to make his trade request public. âEventually I need to stop answering questions about this, but I kind of had to play the bad guy in order to do it,â Greinke said. âI mean, itâd be nice if it didnât happen. But the way things were in Kansas City, if I had just kept on being this great person, then fans would have been outraged if I got traded. I kind of had to be the bad guy for a while, which isnât always your No. 1 choice.â Why did he have to be the bad guy? âBecause the fans, I donât know why, but it seemed like they really liked me,â he said. âAs the general manager or coach or owner of the team, the fans recognize what you do, and if you do something that none of the fans like, thereâs going to be backlash against the organization. So if you make it to where they can understand why the general managers and owners did what they did, itâs not as bad a situation for them, and it makes it easier to make the move.â He paused. âIâm gonna try to do it, Iâm not sure, but that will probably be the last question I answer about the past,â Greinke said. âSo thatâs my goal.â Greinke, who struck out two and allowed one hit and no runs on Tuesday, gushed about his new team. The Brewers acquired another solid starter, Shaun Marcum, for the rotation, and decided to keep Prince Fielder in his free-agent walk year. These are not the rebuilding Royals. âThe teamâs awesome, at least on paper,â Greinke said. âItâs just a great team. You look around, and there are superstars all around, pretty much. And a lot of us are locked up for a couple of years. So itâs pretty neat to see.â Greinke is one of three Brewers who started on opening day last season â Yovani Gallardo did it for Milwaukee and Marcum for Toronto â and Manager Ron Roenicke has not given anyone the assignment yet for this year. Greinke sounded more interested in finding out which Brewers pitcher will be the best hitter, and he compared himself to Ryan Braun, the teamâs All-Star left fielder. âIâm kind of like Ryan Braun, where I swing really hard,â Greinke said. âHis hand-eye coordination is pretty amazing. Hopefully mine is too, but probably not that good, obviously. Iâm a little guy, but I have a little power for being small.â Greinke is 4 for 24 as a hitter, with one home run. The Brewers acquired him for his arm, of course, and hope he can help them back to the postseason, which they have missed the last two years. Greinke has never been there. âWhen the season starts if weâre winning — when weâre winning — I would think itâd be a lot more fun,â he said.
