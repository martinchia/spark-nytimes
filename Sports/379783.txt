The United States Womenâs national team is set to return to the final of the Algarve Cup after its 2-0 victory over Norway on Friday. Lindsay Tarpley scored in her first national team start since 2009. The Boston Breakers forward met an Amy Rodriguez back-heel and blasted a left-footed shot into an empty net. The U.S. had an opportunity to double its lead five minutes later but outside midfielder Megan Rapinoe sent a looping shot just wide. In the 63rd minute, central midfielder Carli Lloyd secured the U.S. victory after she eluded a defender and dispatched a grass-cutting shot from 23 yards out. It was Lloydâs 25th career international goal.  Defenders Christie Rampone and the substitute Becky Sauerbrunn each had second-half chances but neither could convert. The U.S. retained possession and continued to fire shots but none would find the back of net.  The United States opened the tournament on Wednesday with a 2-1 win against potential World Cup dark horses Japan. Fridayâs victory guarantees passage from Group A, regardless of how the team fares against Finland in its remaining group game on Monday. The team will have to wait to see results from Group B and Group C before its opponent in the final  is determined. The two teams with the most points after three group matches will advance to the final on Wednesday. The annual 12-team tournament in the Algarve region of Portugal features a selection of the best womenâs national teams in the world. The Algarve Cup serves an even greater purpose this year, as the June 26 kick-off of the 2011 FIFA Womenâs World Cup nears. World Cup-bound teams are afforded the valuable opportunity to fine-tune squads in a tournament environment.     It is an ideal rehearsal for the American women who are no strangers to the Algarve Cup final. This marks the ninth consecutive time the team has advanced to the championship game. The team looks to retain its title after narrowly defeating Sweden in penalty kicks last year. Another Algarve Cup victory will be a major boost for the U.S. after a disappointing second half to 2010. After a string of lackluster summer friendlies, the U.S. was eliminated in the semifinals of Concacaf Womenâs World Cup qualifying tournament after a listless 2-1 loss to Mexico. The result forced Coach Pia Sundhageâs team into a playoff with Italy. The U.S. won the home-and-home series with an aggregate score of 2-0, but lacked the cohesive, fluid play on display in earlier matches.  Questions about the American women were quieted with the teamâs convincing win at the Four Nations tournament in China in January. Wins over China and Canada helped restore confidence.  With the recent results in Portugal, the team seems to be building momentum. Another tournament triumph will provide the U.S. women with confidence before the biggest test of all this summer.
