Thereâs talk of the Jets reshuffling their offensive coaching staff. Theyâd be fools to let Brian Schottenheimer, one of the best young offensive coordinators in the game, get away. The Jets’ problems pertain to player personnel. Theyâre constructed to run the ball and win with defense. Thatâs why they felt comfortable building around a quarterback that has limitations like Mark Sanchez. Game management and defense is a formula that worked for them in â09 and â10. This season, their run game flat-lined and Sanchez was exposed as a jittery one-read passer. The Jets must make a decision: do they stick with the run emphasis on offense, which goes against the grain of todayâs N.F.L. but is something that defensive aficionado Rex Ryan has pulled off twice before? Or, do they look to upgrade their passing attack? Sticking with the run means finding at least one, and maybe two, new running backs (LaDainian Tomlinson is nearing his end and, after three years, itâs clear that Shonn Greene is a vanilla rotation player). Upgrading the passing attack means finding a new quarterback. It would also mean altering personnel at wide receiver, though that might happen either way, as itâs hard to imagine Santonio Holmes being welcomed back after his display of selfishness down the stretch this season. The Jets were able to acquire Holmes for pennies on the dollar before last season because of his behavior in Pittsburgh. It was a good pickup because Holmesâs behavior was an issue only off the field; he produced between the lines. Thatâs obviously changed now. Whatâs more, Holmes stopped consistently beating man coverage this season, which had been his greatest trait. With looming changes at wide receiver, the decision of what to do offensively still comes down to overhauling the running game versus overhauling the passing game. The Jets are already built to run, and itâs easier to find a good ball carrier than a good ball thrower. That seems like the easier solution. Itâs a much smarter solution than making scapegoats of the offensive coaching staff. Andy Benoit is an NFL analyst for CBSSports.com and founder of NFLTouchdown.com.
