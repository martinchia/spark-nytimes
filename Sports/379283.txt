In his previous outing against the Atlanta Braves, on June 15, the rookie Dillon Gee had perhaps his best stuff of the year. He pitched four scoreless innings that night with only one hit and two walks.   Unfortunately for Gee, the game was delayed by rain long enough that he could not come back out afterward to pitch again. The Mets went on to win the game, but Gee did not pitch long enough to earn his eighth victory.   The next time he took the mound, Tuesday night against the Oakland Aâs, his stuff was not nearly as crisp, and this time there was no rain to save him.   In his worst performance of the year, Gee pitched four innings again, but was knocked out by his own lack of command, rather than the elements. He walked a career-high six batters, four of whom came in to score as the Mets were beaten, 7-3, by the Aâs and lost for the third time in four games.     âIâve got to set a better tone for the game,â Gee said. âI couldnât locate the fastball. I couldnât find the release point.â   Gee fell to 7-1 and the Mets lost for the first time in his 11 starts, leaving Manager Terry Collins agitated, despite the fact that Gee has been impressive.   âThatâs certainly not the guy we know,â Collins said. âThis is a game of adjustments. You have to adjust every day, every night, every inning and I donât think we made any adjustments. The sinker wasnât working; it was off the plate or whatever it was. But you have to adjust. If that means you have to throw it down the middle, then you have to throw it down the middle.â   Collins was annoyed that Gee did not throw his curveball until the third inning, he said, but Gee said the reason for that was that his command of the curve was even worse than his fastball.  âIf I canât throw a fastball for a strike, I probably canât throw a curve for a strike,â he said.   Because of his command, Gee has drawn comparisons to the former Mets pitcher Rick Reed, who had exceptional control. But on Tuesday he was as wild as he has ever been as a professional.
 Six walks is âridiculous,â he said.    The leadoff batter, Jemile Weeks, walked to start the game, and then Gee walked the No. 2 hitter, Cliff Pennington. The Aâs would load the bases and score their first two runs on a sacrifice fly by Hideki Matsui and a ground out by Conor Jackson.   Gee did not walk anyone in the second inning, but it was not because he was pitching better. The hitters just swung at the same bad pitches they were taking an inning before, and made outs.   But in the top of the third it was the same problems again as Weeks and Pennington walked again to start off the third inning. After an out, Matsui walked, and then Gee walked Jackson to force in another run.   âThey scored four runs early in the game on bases on balls,â Collins said. âYou canât do that here, especially him. Heâs way too good to walk guys.â The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
