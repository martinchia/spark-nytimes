 Women's tennis sees upsets and injuries at the United States Open. As the end of a topsy-turvy first week nears at the United States Open, the spotlight has fallen squarely on the new crop of American women and men. Christina McHale, 19, ended the hopes of No. 8 Marion Bartoli; Irina Falconi, 21, ousted No. 14 Dominika Cibulkova before losing Friday to No. 22 Sabine Lisicki; Sloane Stephens, 18, outplayed Shahar Peer, a former top-20 player; and Vania King, 22, took out No. 29 Jarmila Gajdosova. Donald Young, 22, just advanced to the third round, drawing a capacity crowd to Court 17, where he won a thrilling fifth-set tiebreaker against No. 14 Stanislas Wawrinka. And Jack Sock, 18, takes on Andy Roddick in Friday nightâs featured match. Kim Clijsters, the defending champion, is sidelined with an abdominal injury, and Venus Williams is out after a diagnosis of SjÃ¶gren’s syndrome. Also out of the tournament: No. 3 Maria Sharapova, a former champion, No. 5 Petra Kvitova, the Wimbledon champion, and No. 6 Li Na, the French Open winner.  So all eyes are on Serena Williams, seeded just 28 after coming back from health problems of her own, but now favored to win her fourth Open title. Meanwhile, the No. 2 seed, Vera Zvonareva, who outlasted No. 30 Anabel Medina Garrigues on Friday in a closely contested straight sets victory, moves on to the fourth round largely unnoticed. After the match, she said that players like Williams deserve the attention: âIf I win a Grand Slam or many Grand Slams one day, maybe, yeah, people will talk about me the same way.â Along with No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki, whom she defeated in last yearâs semifinals, Zvonareva is one of the best players still seeking a Grand Slam singles title (she has major victories in doubles and mixed doubles). A versatile all-court player, the top Russian relies on speedy court coverage and careful shot selection to construct and win long rallies. âI need to focus on everything to master my game,â she said in an interview with Straight Sets. At her best, she is smart, precise and unrelenting. But when her frustrations pour onto the court, as they often have in the past, she has been her own worst enemy. Now 26, Zvonareva says that age and experience have taught her how to make better choices. âI think Iâm a much more mature player this year,â she said. âI know myself better. I know how much time I need to practice before matches, how much time I need to rest, how many hours of sleep I need and what is the best for me to eat before the matches.â  She had to give up bananas after tests showed that she was allergic to the tennis staple. âIâm allergic to banana, which is a little bit upsetting,â she said. âIf the match before you goes a little bit longer and youâre a little bit hungry, you can always grab a banana.â  With or without the sportâs unofficial fruit, Zvonareva remains confident about her chances. âI got a great experience reaching the finals last year and hopefully I can go one step further this year.â Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
