GREENBURGH, N.Y. â Jeremy Lin, a Harvard-educated point guard and N.B.A. summer-league sensation, is joining the Knicks. His stay may be short. The Knicks claimed Lin, 23, off waivers on Tuesday, two days after losing Iman Shumpert, their prized rookie guard, to a sprained knee ligament. Shumpert is expected to miss two to four weeks. Lin will be the Knicksâ third point guard until he returns. âIf somebody wakes up with a cold, heâs playing a lot,â Coach Mike DâAntoni said. âIf not, weâll see.â

Lin went undrafted in 2010, after a four-year career at Harvard, where he averaged a modest 12.9 points. But he dazzled fans and scouts at the Las Vegas summer league and parlayed the excitement into a free-agent contract with the Golden State Warriors. The signing generated instant buzz in the Bay Area, because of Linâs local roots (Palo Alto) and his Taiwanese heritage, which made him popular with the regionâs large Asian-American population. Lin played just 29 games as a rookie, averaging 2.6 points in 9.8 minutes for the Warriors. He played another 20 games for the Reno affiliate in the development league, averaging 18 points, 5.8 rebounds and 4.3 assists. The Warriors waived Lin on Dec. 9 to clear salary-cap room. He spent two weeks with the Houston Rockets before being cut again last weekend.   Linâs first game in a Knicks uniform will come against the Warriors, on Wednesday night in Oakland.  The Knicks are thin in the backcourt and particularly at point guard, where they have only Toney Douglas and Mike Bibby. Lin will provide some insurance, but he is not expected to play a major role and could be waived once Shumpert returns.  Team officials have a $2.5 million cap exception to spend and want to keep their 15th roster spot open in case a worthwhile player becomes available at some point this season. But the Knicks do like Lin. âHe went to Harvard, so he may be the smartest guy we have,â DâAntoni said. âHeâs very quick. He defends pretty well, but he can really get in the lane and distribute the basketball. We havenât seen him play in a couple years, but when we worked him out we thought we liked him.â
