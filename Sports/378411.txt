The Patriots have ascended to bona fide New England institution. Nine Super Bowl appearances will do that. So, too, will a war with the N.F.L. over what fans saw as an overinflated cheating investigation into underinflated footballs.
 The scandal over the footballs that came to be known as “Deflategate” so outraged New England’s rank and file that the Patriots were transformed from a football team into a cause. And Tom Brady’s response to Deflategate -- a years-long rebellion against the commissioner, Roger Goodell, -- rallied New Englanders like a second American Revolution. If that sounds like an exaggeration, consider that Goodell, fearing he might be tarred and feathered, has not set foot near the Patriots’ home fort of Gillette Stadium since Deflategate commenced. I am a native New Englander who has lived and worked almost half his life in the region. The question for me, and now you, is among the region’s traditional institutions established across parts of five centuries, where do the Patriots rank? Certainly not as big as Dunkin’ Donuts, but they are definitely bigger than maple syrup. You get the picture. There are no wrong answers – unless you’re from southern Connecticut and want to write in the Yankees or Giants. But after making your selections, there will be an analysis of your responses.
    And don’t forget. The Patriots are not bigger than Paul Revere but they are bigger than candlepin bowling.

An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Super Bowl appearances by the Patriots. It is their seventh appearance in 16 years, not the sixth in 15. Advertisement
