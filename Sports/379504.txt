NO. 11 FLORIDA STATE AT NO. 21 CLEMSON 3:30 p.m. Eastern, ESPN Florida State travels to Death Valley, where it has not won in 10 years. Seminoles quarterback E J Manuel is questionable after he sprained his nonthrowing shoulder in a loss to top-ranked Oklahoma last week. His backup, Clint Trickett, threw a tying 56-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter against the Sooners, but starting for the first time in a toughÂ road environmentÂ could be an intimidating situation. He will not be helped if the Seminoles cannot do better than the 27 yards of rushing they managed against Oklahoma.Â The Tigers trailed Auburn by 14-0 last week before rallying for a 38-24 victory to that ended Auburnâs 17-game winning streak. Quarterback Tajh Boyd passed for 386 yards and 4 touchdowns as Clemson racked up 624 total yards. If this is the year that Florida State returns to prominence, it needs a victory Saturday. NO. 7 OKLAHOMA STATE AT NO. 8 TEXAS A&M  3:30 p.m. Eastern, ABC This is the first matchup between top-10 teams at Kyle Field since 1975. The winner will move into good position in both the Big 12 and the national title races. (Remember, with the departure of Colorado and Nebraska, there is no Big 12 championship game this season.) Quarterback Ryan Tannehill leads a balanced Aggies offense that features solid running backs in Cyrus Gray and Christine Michael. Oklahoma State averages 52.3 points a game. Wide receiver Justin Blackmon, left, is one of the best players in the country, and if the Aggies focus too much on stopping him, quarterback Brandon Weeden and running back Joseph Randle can make them pay.  NO. 14 ARKANSAS AT NO. 3 ALABAMA 3:30 p.m. Eastern, CBS Arkansas has struggled to protect quarterback Tyler Wilson against some inferior opponents, which doesnât bode well for a road matchup against one of the best defenses in the country. The Tide returns nineÂ starters from a team that held Arkansas to only 64 yards rushing in a 24-20 victory last season. Alabama running backs Trent Richardson and Eddie Lacy are capable of big plays and represent a major test for an improved Arkansas defense. The Southeastern Conferenceâs West Division is formidable this season, and a loss for either team could make an already tough road tougher. NO. 2 LOUISIANA STATE AT NO. 16 WEST VIRGINIA 8 p.m. Eastern, ABC L.S.U. faces its third top-25 team of season. The Tigersâ defense looked great in the season opener against high-powered Oregon and did not allow Mississippi State to score a touchdown last week. West Virginiaâs offense has some impressive statistics but has yet to put together a complete game. The Mountaineers and quarterback Geno Smith will need to put together a flawless game to pull off an upset. MISSOURI AT NO. 1 OKLAHOMA 8 p.m. Eastern, FX Last season Missouri upset No. 1 Oklahoma, but that game was at home with Blaine Gabbert at quarterback. Gabbert is now starting in the N.F.L. and this game is at Memorial Stadium, where the Sooners have won 37 straight, the longest active streak in the Football Bowl Subdivision.
