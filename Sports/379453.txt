EDISON, N.J. â The drivable par-4 18th hole at Plainfield Country Club has created a buzz at the Barclays this week. But while there have been plenty of birdies at the 285-yard hole, there has been just one eagle through the completion of the first round Friday morning. Troy Matteson recorded the lone eagle among the 123 players in the field. Finishing his round on Thursday afternoon, Matteson holed his 36-yard second shot from the fairway on 18 to make a 2 and shoot 72. Matteson is No. 84 on the FedEx Cup points list. The 18th played as the third-easiest hole in the first round with a scoring average of 3.63. There were 51 birdies and just 8 bogeys.  A number of players hit the green with their tees shots on 18, but none were able to make the putt for eagle, with most two-putting for birdie. This included Phil Mickelson, who hit his tee shot to eight feet Friday morning then had to make a five-foot comeback putt for birdie to wrap up a round of 67. Then there was the Australian Steven Bowditch, who began his round on No. 10 on Thursday morning. Bowditch, No. 122 on the FedEx Cup list, had a five-foot eagle putt on 18 but three-putted for par en route to shooting 75.
