To define the steady ascendance of Germany’s Bundesliga to the top of European soccer in the last few years, one should look no further than the progress Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich have made the past few seasons.   One club, Bayern Munich, the once proverbial dark horse of modern day European soccer, is forever lurking in the shadows of Spain’s, Italy’s and Englandâs packs of superclubs. It has been transformed into a team more fitting of a club with as illustrious a history as its own and now regularly finds itself locking horns with the continentâs best for European silverware. While the other, Borussia Dortmund, struts across Europe with a reputation of fast, exciting soccer from a choir of young starlets that seems to precede it in every foreign ground it travels to. At home in the Bundesliga, the two teams define the term rivalry, having battled for the league championship for the past two seasons, with Dortmund coming out on top in both title races. On Saturday they lock horns again for the first time this season, in the hope of putting a dent in their opponentâs claim to this seasonâs title.   So far we have seen Bayern leads the way with a record 37 points in its opening 14 games, rattling each opponent to the point of submission, as it impatiently makes it way to the title. With its emphatic win over Freiburg on Wednesday night, the club has already claimed the title of Herbstmeister (winter champion) with four games left before the break.  The manner in which Bayern tore through Hannover — which is admittedly a team still hungover from its Euro escapades a few days before —  last Saturday afternoon, with five spectacular goals, portrayed a team not only head and shoulders above the rest, but a group of players content with the level they have reached together.  Fortunes have been spent acquiring new players since the unfortunate Champions League final last May, yet the one attribute that stands above any quantity of skill or boosted expression of ability is the simple change in ethos within the team and among the players.  When Javi Martínez finally scored his opening goal for Bayern Munich last Saturday, with a spectacular overhead kick, the entire team rushed over to congratulate him while Jupp Heynckes and Matthias Sammer embraced on the sideline. Long gone are the days of locker room spats between Arjen Robben and Frank Ribéry or monthly public assessments from the boardroom. In its place, a side full of character; from Danteâs boisterous hair and goofy smile, to the youthful and sometimes playful attacking quartet of Thomas Müller,
Xherdan Shaqiri and Toni Kroos. The cold, professional Bayern is gone. In its place is a happy, expressive team hungry for goals.  Yet in Jürgen Kloppâs Borussia Dortmund, Bayern face a tricky opponent that specializes in one thing — beating Bayern Munich — and a team that has found itself behind at this point of the season before, only to catch the seasoned Bavarian team and ultimately beat it to the title. Like a poor Bundesliga-themed episode of “The Twilight Zone,” this Dortmund team can rely on its experience and knowledge regarding the energy and commitment required in picking up the Bundesliga title, while Bayern, after two failed attempts, continues to falter like plucky underdogs.  The champion’s form so far this season has been anything but consistent, with disappointing results and points dropped against teams like Hannover and Frankfurt, with a recent below par draw against Fortuna Düsseldorf this week opening the gap between it and Bayern to 11 points.  This in part has been because Dortmund traditionally takes a little longer to get its season started compared to most teams, as well as the focus on the Champions League after last seasonâs humiliating group stage exit. Compared with its impressive performances against the likes of Real Madrid and Ajax to recent Bundesliga ties against Düssledorf and Freiburg, it is fairly evident where each fall in Kloppâs list of priorities.  As a result, this weekendâs showdown offers an important opportunity for both sides. Bayern’s hopes of putting the league title beyond any doubt with a comfortable 14-point lead should end any late challenge from the defending champions before it had a chance to get started. While Dortmund will be hoping to put a timely dent in the Bavarian juggernaut, and plant a seed of doubt in the hope of it sprouting just before May.  The game should be considered a genuine title decider despite how early in the season it may be. Whatever the result, it will echo on throughout the winter break and likely set the tone for the remainder of the season.   Follow Stefan Bienkowski on Twitter.
