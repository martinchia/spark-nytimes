Advertisement By STEVEN CRIST The Belmont Stakes was the last of four stakes races on a rich card at Belmont Park yesterday, and one of the supporting features provided one of the biggest upsets of the season. Banker's Lady, a 4-year-old filly who was gaining superstar status off a career record of eight victories in nine starts, went postward as the 3-to-10 favorite in the $225,200 Hempstead Handicap. She had beaten most of her opponents easily, and seemed close to a sure thing after she scampered off to an early 1 1/2-length lead. After half a mile, though, Colonial Waters rushed up to press her, and after the two fillies dueled into the stretch turn, both began to fade. Rose's Cantina circled the field from last place and drew off to a 6 1/2-length victory over Make Change. Colonial Waters faded to third and Banker's Lady ran fourth, beaten 11 lengths. Cordero Was Surprised ''She's never run like that before,'' said Angel Cordero Jr., her rider. Of the $273,751 bet to show on the race, $243,975 of it was on Banker's Lady. So her off-the-board finish prompted some strange payoffs. Rose's Cantina paid $16.60 to win, $6.60 to place and $20.40 to show. Make Change paid $10.60 to place and $37 to show. Colonial Waters paid $19.20 to show. Advertisement Rose's Cantina, a 5-year-old Naskra mare owned by Carl Icahn and trained by Leroy Jolley, ran the mile and an eight in 1:48.70 under Jean Cruguet.

Fierce Fighter was third and Kechi fourth in a field of eight. Is It True, who scored a major upset victory over Easy Goer in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last Nov. 4, paid $3.20 and ran the seven furlongs in 1:22.29 under Chris Antley.
