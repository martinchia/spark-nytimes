Ryota Igarashi, who is in the final season of a two-year, $3 million contract, had another ineffective relief outing for the Mets on Wednesday, allowing a walk and two doubles in the ninth inning of a 7-3 victory over San Diego.  Known as Rocket Boy for how hard he once threw in Japan, he now has an earned run average of 5.56 for the season and is one of eight Mets pitchers in their history with at least 40 innings pitched and an overall E.R.A. of at least 6.00. In descending order of their hapless E.R.A.âs, here are the eight:  Calvin Schiraldi: 7.63 E.R.A., 43 2/3 innings, 1984-85.
He actually helped the Mets while pitching for Boston in the 1986 World Series, when he had a 13.50 E.R.A. in three games.  Jeremy Griffiths: 7.02 E.R.A, 41 innings, 2003.
It was a battle of zero career victories (for Griffiths) and 300 (for Roger Clemens) when they started against each other in a 2003 Mets-Yankees interleague game.  Ryota Igarashi: 6.45 E.R.A, 53 innings, 2010-11.  Tyler Yates: 6.36 E.R.A, 46 2/3 innings, 2004.
The good news: In his first major league game he did not allow a run. Phil Hennigan: 6.23 E.R.A., 43 1/3 innings, 1973.
He was 0-4 to boot. Ray Daviault: 6.22 E.R.A., 81 innings, 1962.
Contributed to Metsâ 40-120 record. Dock Ellis: 6.04 E.R.A., 85 innings, 1979.
Of course, he won 17 games for the Yankees in 1976.  Alay Soler: 6.00 E.R.A., 45 innings, 2006.
Walked the first three batters he faced in his major league debut.
