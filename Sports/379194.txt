Advertisement  Running back ROBERT SMITH is returning to the Ohio State team he quit in a dispute with an assistant coach whom he says told him to skip class to attend football practice. "I told the team this morning he is coming back and of, course, they're happy," Coach JOHN COOPER said yesterday. "I'm happy. Robert's happy." Smith, who broke ARCHIE GRIFFIN's school rushing record for freshmen in 1990, quit the team last August in a disagreement with the offensive coordinator, ELLIOTT UZELAC, over his studies. Uzelac resigned as an assistant coach last month, saying he wanted to pursue other coaching opportunities. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
