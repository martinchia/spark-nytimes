Advertisement  CALVIN GROVE, a champion once, thought he lost a title by "cold-blooded robbery." Now he's just a contender, determined to reclaim what he considers rightfully his: a world boxing championship. His obstacle on Nov. 7 in Lake Tahoe, Nev., will be AZUMAH NELSON of Ghana, the heavy-hitting three-time champion in two weight divisions who will be defending his World Boxing Council superfeatherweight title. "I was robbed," Grove said yesterday at a news conference, recalling the torrid August afternoon in Mexicali, Mexico, in 1988 when he lost his featherweight championship to JORGE PAEZ. The crime, according to Grove, took place in a dusty bullring packed with 16,000 Mexican fans after Grove had dominated his Mexican challenger for 14 rounds only to be dropped a couple of times in the 15th. For anyone who doubts his account, Grove offers a clincher. In a sport where 10-9 is the usual round score and it takes a knockdown to win by 10-8, he said one of the judges scored that final round 10-4. Grove's complaint would have more weight it wasn't for what happened in the rematch seven months later, when the temperature was only 120 degrees. "I lost fair and square," he said. "I was exhausted." We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
