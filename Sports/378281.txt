Advertisement  The Giants can now start thinking about Neil O'Donnell. Bubby Brister, who started 30 games in a row as the Pittsburgh Steelers' quarterback, has a sprained knee and was listed yesterday as "questionable," or 50-50, to play against the Giants at Pittsburgh next Monday night. The quarterback suffered the injury in a scramble for a loose ball last Sunday night in his team's victory over the Colts. He played the rest of the game until O'Donnell came in for the final drive. O'Donnell, a second-year player out of Maryland, did not get into action last season. In fact, the only passes he has thrown in his brief National Football League career were the five he threw against the Colts on Sunday. He completed two. Because the Giants-Steelers game will be Monday night, Brister has an extra day to recuperate. But if the Steelers call on O'Donnell, it will mean they will have to use a greatly diminished offensive game plan, orchestrated by Joe Walton. Last year, in his first season as the Pittsburgh offensive coordinator, Walton was forced to simplify his schemes after Brister complained they were too complicated.
