Advertisement  The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit yesterday granted the National Basketball Players Association an expedited appeal of a lower court loss to the N.B.A. that kept intact the salary cap, college draft and right of first refusal. The union argued that a fast hearing was needed because training camps start in early October. Last month, the N.B.A. sued the union in United States District Court to persuade the court that its labor stalemate was not a court issue. The union countered by contending that the disputed policies violated antitrust law. In granting the appeal, the appellate court in New York said the history of litigation between the N.B.A. and the union "makes it more appropriate -- rather than less so -- to afford these parties an opportunity to appeal these issues before they are pressed to enter into a collective bargaining agreement." The union asked for arguments be heard in late August. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
