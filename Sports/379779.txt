  The mostly inaudible thud as Wednesday night turned into Thursday morning emanated from Guatemala City, where the United States under-20 national team lost to the hosts, 2-1, ending its hope of playing in the FIFA U-20 World Cup this summer in Colombia. The American team, sprinkled with professional players, failed to advance to the tournament in which it has played eight straight times. âObviously we are extremely disappointed by this result,â United States Coach Thomas Rongen said. âIf you look at the game, you have to take your hat off to Guatemala. The home team came to play. They had a good game plan. We have to move on, and I firmly believe that within this group we have very capable players who will move on to represent our team at the senior team or Olympic level, but today wasnât our day. It was a good host team, and our team wasnât able to click on all cylinders.â  The loss to Guatemala in the quarterfinals means all four Concacaf participants will be Hispanic teams:Â  Mexico, Guatemala, Panama and Costa Rica. The American team advanced to the knockout round by outscoring its two earlier opponents, 6-0. But it encountered an inspired home team, which had not beaten the United States at this age level in 47 years. Guatemala qualified for the championship for the first time. The United States fell behind in the 33rd minute when GersÃ³n Lima’s header from Kevin Herrarte’s corner kick beat goalkeeper Zac MacMath to the far post. The Americans opened the second half with renewed purpose and pressure. Sebastian Lletget came close in the 50th minute. Then, five minutes later, Conor Doyle, who plays in England with Derby County, smashed a shot off the post. The United States drew even in the 66th minute when Amobi Okugo threaded a pass to the streaking Doyle, who scored on a chip over Guatemala’s goalkeeper, JosÃ©Â Carlos GarcÃ­a. But the deadlock did not last long. In what some outlets are describing as a goal against the run of play, Guatemala took back the lead for good in the 69th minute when JosÃ©Â Castillo found Henry LÃ³pez with a pass into the penalty area. LÃ³pez held off Gale Agbossoumonde and beat MacMath for the game-winner. The American team was playing in the regional qualifying tournament without a key player — Red Bulls striker Juan Agudelo. Agudelo had been with the under-20 team in the run-up to qualifying, but was called up to the senior national team for recent matches against Argentina and Paraguay. Agudelo could have found himself playing for the under-20 team in his native Colombia and for the senior national team in the Concacaf Gold Cup a month earlier. The elimination of the United States is certain to bring the usual questions to the fore. First among them, should Rongen, a native of the Netherlands who has long made his soccer home in the United States, be retained? Are United States preparations still somehow wanting when it comes to major international tournaments? Why isn’t a country with the size and resources of the United States still unable to dominate the sport in the region at all levels? But perhaps most important, is the United States developing enough quality players, and if not, why?
