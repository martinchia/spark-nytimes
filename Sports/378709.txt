 NATAL, Brazil —  On September 5, 1993, a date etched in the memory of all Colombians, the Colombian soccer team upset the order of things. The country’s soccer history has been a story of underachievement, but that day, in a World Cup qualifier considered one of the greatest matches ever played in Latin American, Colombia danced around the Argentine defense and scored five goals. Alfio Basile, Argentina’s manager at the time, called it “a crime against nature.” Colombians, understanding the magnitude of the victory against the heavily favored Argentines, called it “parricide.” Diego Maradona, the Argentine star, said afterward: “Colombia can’t break history. Argentines have to continue as we are: Argentina on top, Colombia underneath.” More than two decades later, Colombia, playing in its first World Cup since 1998, has reason to believe.

But then it was Argentina that helped teach Colombia how to play the game. 
                Colombia continued its impressive run after finishing its group 3-0 with a 2-0 victory, led by James Rodriguez and his two goals.             From 1949 to 1954, with the establishment of a breakaway league free of international restrictions, Colombia was able to secure the services of some of the best soccer players on the continent, an era known as El Dorado. Players gravitated to places where their countrymen had settled: Brazilians in Barranquilla, Argentines in Bogotá, Uruguayans in Cúcuta and Costa Ricans, said to play the game beautifully, at the University of Bogotá. When this soccer circus of foreign players closed, the domestic game reverted to its amateurish state. It was not until the 1980s that Colombian soccer gained any momentum, drug money and soccer having by then combined to make a heady cocktail. But the progress faltered when Andrés Escobar, a defender on the 1994 national team, was killed outside a Medellín nightclub on the day the World Cup entered its knockout phase.

Soon after, as the story goes, the Colombian author Gabriel García Márquez was told that only three important things had taken place in his home country: the vast riots that leveled Bogotá in 1948, known as El Bogotazo; the 1967 publication of his novel “One Hundred Years of Solitude”; and the 1993 victory over Argentina. García Márquez supposedly responded: “And you know what the terrible thing is about what you say? That it’s true.” Now, improbably, the country has its best chance yet of making it to the quarterfinals. Only Uruguay stands in its way. Uruguay has shown an ability to channel a fighting spirit, but this match might prove beyond its reach. Colombia won, 4-0, in a matchup during qualifying, and without Luis Suárez, who was suspended for the rest of the tournament for biting an Italian opponent, Uruguay will be far weaker up front. Still, Uruguay, a two-time World Cup champion, has history on its side, with the country’s 1950 victory over Brazil in particular still looming large in South American soccer. This will be of no concern to Pékerman, Colombia’s coach, who has established a strong bond with his players and a winning mentality — without any deference to any soccer hierarchy.
