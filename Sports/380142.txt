Advertisement  GEORGE KARL said yesterday he was going to Seattle to be interviewed for the vacant head-coaching job with the SuperSonics. Karl, a former coach of the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers, told reporters he had talked by telephone with the Sonics' president, BOB WHITSITT, but had not struck a deal. On Sunday, he resigned midway through a two-year contract with Real Madrid of the Spanish League. "I hope to be in Seattle in the next day or two to interview," Karl said in Madrid. "I think they want to announce something before the end of the week." Seattle dismissed K. C. JONES as head coach last week. Meanwhile, the Sonics lost a starter, forward DERRICK McKEY, who will miss at least six weeks after he undergoes surgery to repair ligament damage in his right thumb.
