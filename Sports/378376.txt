Advertisement By ROBERT MCG. THOMAS JR. Staten Island, which, as everybody knows, got its name when an early visitor to New York Harbor leaned over the rail and asked "Is t'at an island?" is wrestling with a new nuance of nomenclature. It seems that a promoter has proposed holding a Formula One race on Staten Island in 1993, the same year that the first Indy-car race will be held in lower Manhattan. That wouldn't be a problem except for one thing. In approving the Marlboro Grand Prix of New York last week, the city's Franchise and Concession Review Committee granted the sponsor of the Indy-car race the exclusive use of the terms "New York" and "Grand Prix" in connection with any car race in the city. The ban on "New York" isn't seen as much of a problem, but making "Grand Prix" the exclusive property of the Manhattan Indy-race sponsor seems an outrage to the Formula One set. Formula One, after all, is the grandpere of Grand Prix in auto racing. For all that, it would seem to be a nominal problem that suggests its own solution. "Grand Prix," may be verboten, but this    is    America, after all, and among the names that come to mind is the Staten Island Grand Prize.
