Advertisement  The National Rifle Association should adopt new rules to keep politics out of sport shooting, a United States Olympic Committee panel recommended yesterday, after five sport shooters complained that the N.R.A., which governs the sport under Federal charter, uses it for political, fund-raising and recruitment purposes. "The N.R.A. has turned an Olympic sport into a private office for lobbying, patronage and public relations," said KENT CORRELL, a New York lawyer representing the athletes. The Amateur Sports Act of 1978 recognized the N.R.A. as the national governing body for Olympic rifle, pistol, trap and skeet and running target shooting. The act also required the N.R.A. to form an independent committee to insulate the sport from the N.R.A.'s political activities. But 336 shooters, including ERNEST VANDE ZANDE, shooting's representative on the U.S.O.C.'s Athlete's Advisory Council, signed a petition complaining that the restructured committee still would not comply with the Amateur Sports Act. The U.S.O.C. membership committee said the N.R.A. was in compliance, but recommended two changes in the restructured committee. STEVE SOBEL, chairman of the U.S.O.C. membership committee, did not say whether the U.S.O.C. would remove the N.R.A. as the governing body if the changes aren't made.
