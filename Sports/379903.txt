 Mexico, on the brink of its greatest achievement at a World Cup outside its own country, broke down in the final three minutes of regulation, and again in stoppage time, falling to a crushing 2-1 defeat to the Netherlands in the Round of 16.  The Mexicans dominated the match for much of the first half and the beginning of the second, taking the lead in the 48th minute on Giovani dos Santosâs blistering left-footed strike.  The Netherlands pushed forward in the second half, looking for an equalizer, but Guillermo Ochoa displayed some more outstanding goalkeeping, especially when he deflected a point-blank volley off the goal line to preserve the lead.  But with the quarterfinals tantalizingly close, it was all ripped away from Mexico, starting with Wesley Sneijderâs tying goal in the 88th minute. Sneijder stepped up to hammer home a shot from the top of the penalty area after a Dutch corner kick was knocked back to him.  Then, in the 94th minute of a grueling game in scorching conditions, Arjen Robben dribbled artfully near the Mexico goal and was tripped in the penalty area by Rafael MÃ¡rquez. Klaas jan Huntelaar buried the penalty kick to give the Netherlands the lead and, a minute later, hand Mexico its sixth straight elimination in the Round of 16.  The Netherlands advances to face Greece or Costa Rica in the quarterfinals on Saturday. Full story Â» Giovani Dos Santos gives Mexico a dream start to the second half with a blistering strike!  He takes a bouncing pass from the right side, holds off a defender with his body, and turns to blast the shot into the lower right corner of the net from several yards outside the penalty area. Mexico’s fans erupt, and Miguel Herrera tears down the sideline with all the expected exuberance.  What. A. Goal. Dos Santos with an absolute rocket and Herrera, in full coat-and-tie despite it being a billion degrees, went ballistic. â Sam Borden (@SamBorden) June 29, 2014     It is Wesley Sneijder with an absolute blast that flies into the net and crushes Mexican hearts! On the Netherlands’ 10th corner kick, the ball is knocked out to the top of the area, but Sneijder stepped up and rocketed the ball low and straight into the lower left corner.  And it’s all equal with minutes to go in regulation! The Dutch stay alive. Wow. Can't blame Ochoa for that one. A laser from Sneijder and it looks like we're headed for extra time. — Sam Borden (@SamBorden) June 29, 2014

 Klaas Jan Huntelaar, the substitute, buries the penalty kick into the lower left corner as Guillermo Ochoa dives the wrong way!  What an incredible turnaround, and absolute heartbreak for Mexico in the final moments of this match. Ochoa’s face is pure disbelief.   The Netherlands scored 10 goals in its first three games, and Robin van Persie and Arjen Robben have looked like world-beaters.  Mexico, which barely scraped into the Cup, has restored some national pride with two good wins and a game draw against Brazil. The Dutch will be a stern test, though. A spot in a very winnable quarterfinal against Costa Rica or Greece. Advertisement
