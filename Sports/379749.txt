Don Garber wants Major League Soccer to be the ultimate meritocracy. “We very much believe, and a basic tenet of Major League Soccer is, that every team has to make decisions for themselves that will hopefully provide them with the best chance to be competitive and hopefully win M.L.S. Cup,” Garber, the league’s commissioner, said Tuesday in a conference call with reporters, adding: “We donât want to have a system that existed in the N.A.S.L. or may have existed in other leagues where you can buy success.” Unlike the old North American Soccer League, where a few very wealthy teams lured the top talent and dominated the league, M.L.S. has seen remarkable parity, even if that means a number of teams clustered around the middle. This season, clubs that attempted to spend on big-name players fell short. The Red Bulls, with three international stars in excess of the salary cap, lost in the first round of the playoffs.  The Los Angeles Galaxy, the league’s glamor team, lost in the Western Conference final. So we are left with a title game Sunday in Toronto that pits the F.C. Dallas, making its first championship appearance, against the Colorado Rapids, an also-ran that hasn’t played for the title since 1997. Neither team employs a high-priced designated player, nor do the teams’ rosters feature a player from last summer’s World Cup in South Africa.  “Every team at the beginning of the year has to make decisions that will hopefully provide them with the best chance to compete throughout the season and hopefully win M.L.S. Cup,” Garber said. “I donât believe that there is any formula yet that has been fully established that is the right recipe for success.” Garber outlined some new ingredients for M.L.S. clubs next season: What else would you like to see the league do to help your team compete?
