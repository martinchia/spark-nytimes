Jay Horwitz, the longtime spokesman for the Mets, fractured his ankle Thursday morning while walking to work and will undergo surgery Monday. Horwitz, 66, the teamâs vice president for media relations, has been with the Mets since 1980, and over the years he has become one of the more familiar faces on the team. The Mets said Horwitz, who lives in Clifton, N.J., stayed at a hotel near Citi Field on Wednesday night after the team flew back from Miami so that he could get to work more quickly Thursday, with the Mets scheduled to play a doubleheader against Atlanta, beginning at 4 p.m.  The Mets said Horwitz was at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York and would need at least two weeks of bed rest after his operation. Jason Isringhausen, who has known Horwitz since he was a young player in his first stint with the Mets in the mid-1990s, said some players would try to visit him over the weekend. Meanwhile, Isringhausen, who turned 39 Wednesday, had injury news of his own. Manager Terry Collins disclosed before Thursdayâs first game that his sometime closer had a herniated disk and pinched nerve in his back and, as a result, was experiencing tingling and numbness in his right leg. Collins said Isringhausen would be out for at least a couple of days, and Isringhausen told reporters that he hoped to be given medication shortly that would alleviate at least some of the symptoms. He said he thought it was possible he would pitch again before the regular season ends on Sept. 28. Isringhausen has had a respectable season for the Mets after not pitching in the major leagues since 2009. He first served as a setup man for Francisco Rodriguez, but after Rodriguez was traded to Milwaukee, he temporarily assumed the closerâs role. More recently, that job has been given to Bobby Parnell, who has struggled.  For the season, Isringhausen is 3-3 with 7 saves and a 4.05 earned run average.  âAs of now, I want to pitch next year,ââ he said. Whether he will be able to remains to be seen.
