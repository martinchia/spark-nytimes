Advertisement  Dwight Gooden and Gary Sheffield, uncle and nephew, met behind the plate last night for photographs and conversation. They'll meet at 60 feet 6 inches tonight, and there won't necessarily be smiles. Sheffield, the third baseman acquired by the Padres before the season, is hitting .310, with 4 homers and 21 r.b.i. "Maybe it'll be fun if no one is on base," the 27-year-old Gooden said of his first square-off against his nephew. "But if someone is on base, it'll be all business." Gooden said his only previous encounters with Sheffield came when the pitcher was 12 or 13 and involved a tennis ball. He said he had his own scouting report on his nephew, "but I'm not going to tip my hand." Sheffield, the 23-year-old son of Gooden's sister, said he had been thinking about such a meeting for weeks. "It's like a dream come true," said Sheffield, who spent three seasons in Milwaukee before being traded. "He's like a brother to me. To tell you the truth, I'm doing my best to play it down But it's going to be special." We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
