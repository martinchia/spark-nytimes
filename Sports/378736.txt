In the classic Monty Python sketch “Upper-Class Twit of the Year,” a group of bumbling aristocrats compete on an obstacle course full of challenges both athletic (leaping over books of matches) and misanthropic (kicking beggars, insulting waiters). The competitor Oliver St. John-Mollusc, âthought by many to be this yearâs outstanding twit,â somehow runs himself over with a convertible midway through the race. John Cleese, as the play-by-play announcer, later says of Oliver, âHeâs dead, but heâs not necessarily out of it.â Oliverâs fate neatly sums up the current state of the Philadelphia Eagles. They were thought by many to be this yearâs outstanding twit, and they possessed a remarkable capacity for running themselves over. Yet they are not necessarily out of it. Not only can the 6-8 Eagles still make the playoffs, but their path to the postseason does not involve fractal geometry, and the win-loss combinations that could put them atop the N.F.C. East do not involve the nested logic or if-then operators that are found only in N.F.L. tiebreaker procedures and old Pascal programs.   The Eagles must win their final two games, the Cowboys must lose their final two and the Giants must beat the Cowboys but lose to the Jets. That would leave all three teams at 8-8, but the Eagles would have swept the Cowboys, and their 5-1 division record would put them above the 3-3 Giants. So, after a basic-cable reality TV stunt marriage of a season, the Eagles can still hang their playoff hopes on the outcomes of just four games: Eagles at Cowboys, Redskins at Eagles, Cowboys at Giants and Jets and Giants at each other. This kind of playoff life support is part of the N.F.L.âs grand design, which dates to the 1950s and Commissioner Bert Bellâs Any Given Sunday maxim, which valued competitive balance. Last Sunday was, in fact, Any Given Sunday, a day when the Packers lost, the Colts won, the Redskinsâ offense discovered competence, Andy Reid called running plays and many other improbable events occurred. The Cowboys won easily because they were exempt from the weirdness; they played on Saturday night, Any Given Sunday Eve. As a result of the upsets, only 10 teams have been eliminated from playoff contention in the seasonâs first 15 weeks. Joining the Eagles in the âPrincess Brideâ category (mostly dead) are the 6-8 Chiefs, who just fired their coach; the Seahawks and the Cardinals, 7-7 teams with exactly one offensive weapon each; the 7-7 Bears, who may not know the meaning of the word quit but are pretty sure that âJay Cutler and Matt Forte are injuredâ is a synonym; and the 7-7 Chargers, who called out sick on Columbus Day and did not return to work until after Thanksgiving. But those other teams are garden-variety also-rans. The Eagles are a cautionary tale, or an Oprah-worthy redemption narrative, or the raving manifesto of a lunatic in a tinfoil pirate hat, or all three. The team that beat the Jets on Sunday, with Jason Babin hanging from Mark Sanchez like an enormous Christmas ornament and LeSean McCoy taking enough handoffs to remove the quotation marks from ârunningâ back, bore no resemblance to the bickering, unmotivated assemblage of mercenaries who spent most of the year missing tackles, blowing assignments and griping about their contracts. Like 20-something underachievers who realized their girlfriends would leave them unless they stopped jamming at open mike nights and got a real job, the Eagles combed their hair and abandoned slacker chic in the last two weeks. They are now brilliantly flawed, which is a step up from their brilliantly self-destructive state of earlier this season. The Eaglesâ last-second dash toward respectability was possible only because the Giants and the Cowboys also played their parts in the âTwit of the Yearâ sketch, which ends with all participants shooting themselves just before the finish line. The Giants once again mistakenly downloaded the Yankeesâ schedule and thought they could play hard until early November, then go home for a few months. With their knack for tipping balls into the air, the Giantsâ receiving corps remains the worldâs greatest undiscovered beach volleyball team. The Cowboys approach the final minutes of every close game with all of the smoothness and confidence of the audio-visual club president approaching the cheerleading captain at a junior high dance, and they typically come away with similar results. The Eagles and the Giants lost to the Seahawks, who have a huge expertise advantage when it comes to backing into the playoffs by technicality. Desperate December surges are nothing new for the Eagles, who often go into season-salvage mode the moment they hear the phrase âdoor-buster savings.â The 2008 Eagles fell to 5-5-1 and needed a brief wake-up call in the form of a Donovan McNabb benching in a 35-7 loss to the Ravens before embarking on a hot streak that took then to the N.F.C. championship game. The 2006 Eagles were 5-6 before Jeff Garcia replaced the injured McNabb and propelled them into the playoffs with a five-game winning streak. Both of those teams beat the Giants in the postseason, which at least is impossible this year. Before the late comebacks, the 2006 and 2008 seasons also each appeared to mark the end of the Andy Reid era in Philadelphia. Reidâs tenure is best thought of not in modern historical terms, as something with a clearly defined ending, but as an eternal cycle of death, rebirth and uninformative news conferences. Every year, some midseason games must be sacrificed to the angry gods of clock mismanagement and imbalanced offense to ensure next yearâs harvest of Michael Vick bombs and DeSean Jackson instigations. Playoff losses and near misses are best thought of not as failures, but burnt offerings that provide Reid with employment immortality. So, if the Eagles steal the N.F.C. East crown, do not blame the Giantsâ December doldrums or the Cowboysâ fourth-quarter server crashes. Blame a league that celebrates parity as a guiding principle, and a team that has spent a half decade proving that death does not mean they are necessarily out of it.
