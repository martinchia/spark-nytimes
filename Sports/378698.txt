Advertisement  AP Ray Perkins was dismissed as coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers today, a day after the team ended a losing streak at six games with a victory over the Atlanta Falcons. The Buccaneers' owner, Hugh Culverhouse, who recently said he intended to keep Perkins, named an assistant coach, Richard Williamson, as the team's interim coach. Culverhouse said at a news conference today that the decision wasn't made until early this afternoon during a meeting with Perkins. He said the coach's record since coming to Tampa Bay from Alabama in 1987 was the only reason for the change. The move comes with the Buccaneers a loss away from their eighth consecutive losing season. Their 23-17 victory over the Falcons on Sunday improved their record to 5-8. Perkins's record in just less than four seasons with the Buccaneers was19-41. None of his teams won more than five games. Including four years with the Giants, he has a career National Football League record of 42-75. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
