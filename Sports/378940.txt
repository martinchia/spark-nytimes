EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. â Being part of an event like the Super Bowl encompasses much more than just playing in a football game, and Giants quarterback Eli Manning addressed the team Tuesday to essentially warn his teammates about the distractions that may arise over the next two weeks. Manning, who led the Giants to a championship four years ago, does not often give speeches but felt it was important to state clearly what the Giants should â and should not â be doing as they prepare to face the New England Patriots in Indianapolis on Feb. 5. In particular, Manning advised his teammates to take these few days and settle any travel or ticket issues they may have with family and friends hoping to attend the game. The Giants return to practice on Thursday and by that time, Manning said, the focus should solely be on business. Manning also said â95 percentâ of the Giantsâ game-planning for the Patriots will be installed this week, when the Giants will be working at their own facility. Next weekâs practices in Indianapolis should be nothing more than a âdress rehearsal,â Manning said. For example, Manning plans to hold his weekly meetings with receivers and running backs this week as opposed to waiting until closer to game day. âI was just telling them just a little bit how to prepare for this,â Manning said. âPrepare this week like youâre playing the game this week, because once you get out to Indianapolis, youâve got to take a bus ride to practice and the whole schedule gets thrown off.â Manning added: âWeâve got to have everything that we normally have to do during a normal work week, weâre going to try to get it done this week.â Many of the differences for the players next week will be in the amount of media sessions they are required to attend though Manning showed he is already sharpening his wit for the barrage of interviews. Asked yet again if he has any regrets about his famous comment from the summer â when he stated he believed he was an âeliteâ quarterback â Manning shook his head. âObviously itâs been made into a big deal, but I canât always control that,â he said. âMy job is to play the game. Itâs your job to talk and make up stories.â The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
