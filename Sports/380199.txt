Advertisement  Xavier McDaniel of the Knicks is expected to exercise the $500,000 buyout clause in his contract, which would make him an unrestricted free agent after this season. McDaniel and his lawyer, David Falk, have both said that the veteran small forward wants to remain with the Knicks, but that exercising the buyout clause by the deadline Wednesday would give McDaniel more leverage in negotiating a contract in the future. If McDaniel were not to exercise the option, he would be under contract through the 1993-94 season. McDaniel is earning $1.625 million this year, and would average $1.8 million per year during the next two years of his present contract. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
