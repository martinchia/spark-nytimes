SAN ANTONIO â Thursday nightâs national semifinal matches of the N.C.A.A. womenâs volleyball Final Four could not have played out more differently. U.C.L.A. swept the first match of the night, 3-0, against Florida State. In the second game, Illinois and Southern California pushed their match to five sets. Illinois won the fifth set on a match point that included about 50 touches before the Illini notched the 15th and decisive point. After the exhausting conclusion of the match, the Illini did not celebrate their programâs first championship game appearance; the players lined up, shook hands with their Southern California counterparts and began preparing for their matchup against U.C.L.A. âThatâs been our mentality for the whole year, especially during the tournament,â said the Illiniâs Colleen Ward, a senior outside hitter. âWeâre obviously excited that we won and that weâre playing for the championship, but we have been aiming for this next one.â
 The Illini offense features the power-punching senior all-American outside hitters Michelle Bartsch and Ward. They combined for 63.6 percent of the Illiniâs kills against Southern California. Although Illinoisâ outsides may take the most swings, Coach Kevin Hamblyâs offense is lethal because of its ability to score from anywhere on the floor. Four players notched double-digit kills in Thursdayâs match. Illinois is also a big along the front line, with its tallest player, the freshman Liz McMahon, checking in at 6-foot-6. The Bruins need to pay special attention to the 6-foot-2 Ward, who has 49 digs in five tournament matches this year. When Ward, an Illinois native, transferred to the Illini from the University of Florida in 2009, Hambly told his team that âwe have a shot nowâ at winning the national championship. Like the Illini, Coach Michael Sealyâs U.C.L.A. team features a balanced offensive attack with strong defense. Led by the all-American junior outside hitter Rachel Kidder and the first-team all-Pac-12 sophomore outside hitter Kelly Reeves, U.C.L.A. will look to pound the Illini and try to find some open court to put down kills.  The junior outside hitter Tabi Love will also produce on offense as the Bruins look to spread the Illini defense. U.C.L.A. has a great deal of size on its half of the court, with seven players standing at least 6-foot-3. To win, the Bruins need to control the ball on their half of the court and stay within their system. That starts with effective passing from the senior setter Lauren Van Orden. If they can execute their offensive game plan and not let the Illini dictate their offense, the Bruins will be in position to win their fourth N.C.A.A. tournament title. âI think we match up really well with them,â Van Orden said. âThey have some key players on both ends, and I think we have players that can perform there as well. I was very impressed with their ball controlâ in Thursdayâs game, âand we are very similar in that sense. But across the board we match up really well and it is going to be a great fight.â U.C.L.A. is 10-0 all time against Illinois, but the two programs have never faced each other in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Nine of the 10 games have been at neutral sites. U.C.L.A. has won 27 of the 34 sets played between the two universities. The last meeting between the Bruins and the Illini took place Sept. 2, 1994, when U.C.L.A. swept Illinois, 3-0, in Honolulu. Of course, that was a while ago.
