It appears as if the Albert Pujols sweepstakes is over and that Arte Moreno and the Angels have landed baseballâs greatest active hitter for a whopping 10 years and at least $250 million. Cue the second-guessing. The contract will immediately be compared to the contract that Alex Rodriguez signed with the Rangers in 2001, then a record 10 years and $252 million. While that contract was not nearly the albatross that some have made it out to be, there is a gigantic difference between that contract and the one Pujols just agreed to: Alex Rodriguez was a 25-year-old shortstop, not a 31-year-old first baseman (who turns 32 in January). Pujols had a âpoorâ season by his standards in 2011. Hobbled some by injuries, and potentially some by age, he still managed to be the eighth best hitter in the National League by adjusted O.P.S. But with his 32nd birthday just a month away, decline would be expected in the next few seasons from any player not named Nolan Ryan or Barry Bonds. Rodriguez has earned a fair share of criticism and condemnation for his admission that he took performance-enhancing drugs in his years with the Rangers, but it is hard to believe that Pujols could possibly match statistically what Rodriguez did over the course of that contract (which was terminated three years early and then reupped to a deal that with incentives could reach $300 million, which is another discussion entirely).  In the seven years he played of that original 10-year deal, Rodriguez hit 329 home runs, drove in 908 runs, produced an adjusted O.P.S. of 154 (or 54 percent above league average), won three M.V.P.’s, two Gold Gloves and five Silver Sluggers. He even stole 132 bases. Pujols could likely match that production for a few seasons (other than the stolen bases), but to think that at 39 he will still be producing at more than 50 percent above league average does not seem likely. In fairness to Pujols, almost no player could do that. Since 1901, just four players age 39 or older have qualified for the batting title and produced an adjusted O.P.S. of 150 or greater: Barry Bonds (2004, 263 OPS+, age 39), Ted Williams (1958, 179, 39), Babe Ruth (1934, 160, 39) and Willie Mays (1971, 158, 40). It is not a stretch to put Pujols in a category with those players, as through his first 11 seasons he certainly has produced at a similar level to those Hall of Famers. But to think that of all the great hitters in baseball history only four have remained that productive for that long, the odds are certainly against Pujols’s remaining that productive at 39, which, it should be noted, is three years before this contract expires. As ridiculous as it sounds, $25 million a season in 2020 will not be what it was in 2001 because of inflation, so to say that he needs to match Rodriguezâs production to have justified the deal would not be entirely accurate. But what should have Angels fans worried is the fact that the Rangers all but declared the Rodriguez contract untenable just three years into it and traded the teamâs star to New York in hopes of freeing money, and at the time he was still the gameâs best player. The frightening reality of a 10-year deal, at least when a team is not the Yankees and cannot absorb limitless salaries, is that five extremely productive years from a player, even one with a World Series win, could likely still be deemed a disappointment by fans if Pujols were to enter a steep decline phase in his late 30s (as so many players have). And thatâs an awfully high bar to set.
