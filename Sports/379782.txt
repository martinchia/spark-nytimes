The Red Bulls own an odd distinction as they prepare for Saturday’s match against visiting Houston: Bouna Coundoul, who is expected to start his first game of the season, will be the third goalkeeper Coach Hans Backe has used in the club’s first three games. The club opened its Major League Soccer season at Red Bull Arena in Harrison, N.J., two weeks ago with a 1-0 win against Seattle and Greg Sutton in goal, as Backe decided to give the Canadian the start over Coundoul, his No. 1 from last season, who had been to Senegal for a friendly match. Then last week, the Red Bulls were forced to sign Alex Horwath as a stopgap; Sutton had sustained a concussion in training and Coundoul was back in Africa with Senegal for its match against Cameroon in an African Cup of Nations qualifier. All Sutton and Horwath did was come away from their games with shutouts for the Red Bulls (1-0-1, 4 points), who played the Crew to a scoreless draw while missing a half-dozen starters, plus a couple of players to injuries (Sutton and Thierry Henry) from the season opener. Last week’s match also marked the Red Bulls debuts of Corey Hertzog, Luke Rodgers and Stephen Keel. New TV Deal The Red Bulls and the MSG Networks on Thursday announced a new multiyear agreement that will keep the club on the cable network, its only local television home since the league’s inaugural season in 1996. 
Twenty-four games will be carried (in high-definition where available), either on MSG Network or MSG Plus, an increase from the 22 the network carried last season. Returning this year will be the pregame and postgame shows that were eliminated last season. The club wants as much coverage as it can garner from MSG. In addition, the Red Bulls were unhappy that MSG’s Red Bulls announcers — the play-by-play man Steve Cangialosi and the analyst Shep Messing — called the games from MSG’s studios and did not travel to away games. This year, however, they will be on site for most away matches. âMSG Networks has been a valuable partner for our organization since the clubâs inception and we are thrilled to continue our relationship with them,â Erik Stover, the club’s managing director, said in a statement. âWith this new multiyear deal, we expect our fans will be able to view a broadcast that is among the best in Major League Soccer. MSG Networks has made a strong commitment to helping us become the countryâs premier soccer franchise and todayâs announcement is a significant step towards that goal.â All-Star Game Tickets Red Bulls season-ticket holders will get first crack at tickets to the M.L.S. All-Star Game against Manchester United, which will be played at Red Bull Arena on July 27. Tickets will first be made available on April 20 (with a general public sale beginning on June 2).
