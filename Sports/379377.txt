Citi Field’s inaugural soccer game Tuesday night between Ecuador and Greece drew a boisterous crowd of 39,656, most of whom were cheering for Ecuador, and provided a festive atmosphere at a stadium that has been home to its share of bad news this spring. Fans agonized at every scoring opportunity lost and voiced their displeasure with each tackle. In the end, the game ended 1-1, and featured six yellow cards. The Greeks had the better scoring chances in the first half and drew first blood when forward Alexandros Tziolis, who plays for Racing Santander in La Liga in Spain, buried a cross past Ecuador goalkeeper Maximo Banguera in the 16th minute. Ecuador dominated in the second half, and the crowd roared when the Ecuadorians, who are preparing for the upcoming South American championship, the Copa AmÃ©rica, responded with a goal from center back Fricson Erazo in the 58th minute. The second half was tense, on the field and in the crowd. Three yellow cards were called in a 10-minute span, and the crowd grew rowdier as the teams worked in vain for the tie-breaking goal. But the night was never about the matchup itself.  The game will not be the last soccer match at Citi Field. The Mets executive vice president Dave Howard said a friendly between a “very well-known” European club and comparable Central American club was in the works for this summer. He said an announcement was expected within the next week. From our article in Wednesday’s paper: The developments come at a time when Major League Soccer is moving to expand to New York City, with Flushing the likely destination for the leagueâs second team in the area. The Red Bulls, the areaâs only M.L.S. team, play their home games at the 25,000-seat, $200 million Red Bull Arena in Harrison, N.J. âWe remain focused on securing a 20th team for Major League Soccer in New York,â the M.L.S. spokesman Dan Courtemanche said via e-mail. âWe do not have a set time frame on when we will add a 20th team. Our goal is to have a second team in N.Y. at the earliest opportunity. The N.Y. market is a priority, but it may take a couple of years before we have the team and stadium finalized.â Mets ownership, led by Fred Wilpon, has discussed the possibility of owning a club with the M.L.S. commissioner, Don Garber, over the last few years. Howard said the sides had talked again ârecently.â But an M.L.S. club operated by Wilpon may be unlikely given his financial issues the last few months, and Garber has said that there were other ownership groups interested, including a group that has bought the rights to the Cosmos name and is aggressively seeking a team in M.L.S. One obstacle is the lack of a soccer stadium in Queens as teams across M.L.S. have moved away from all-purpose stadiums. âThe New York market is a priority, but it may take a couple of years before we have the team and stadium finalized,â Courtemanche said. Corner kicks: Will New York support a second M.L.S. team? And is Queens the right place for it?
