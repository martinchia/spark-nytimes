Advertisement  AP Jackie Sherrill, who left Texas A&M two years ago with the Aggies on National Collegiate Athletic Association probation, returned to college football today when he was hired as Mississippi State's coach. The 47-year-old Sherrill, who spent two years in private business after resigning from Texas A&M, replaces Rockey Felker, who resigned under pressure two weeks ago after a 5-6 season, the Bulldogs' fourth consecutive losing campaign. The N.C.A.A. eventually cleared Texas A&M of allegations that a former player, George Smith, had received "hush" money, saying it could not distinguish fact from fiction. Smith had said Sherrill, then coach and athletic director, had paid him for his silence about N.C.A.A. rules violations and that a university official later offered $30,000 to recant his charges. The N.C.A.A. said Sherrill was never implicated in any wrongdoing. Sherrill's teams at Texas A&M had a 52-28-1 record in seven seasons, won three consecutive Southwest Conference titles and played in the Cotton Bowl from 1985-87. Sherrill had a 105-42-2 record in 13 seasons as a coach at Texas A&M, Pittsburgh and Washington State. He reportedly received a four-year contract at $75,000 a year.
