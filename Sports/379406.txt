Advertisement  Yesterday was a bad day for Andre Agassi, the men's fourth-seeded player, and he didn't even play. He was fined $3,000 by the International Tennis Federation for using obscene language and spitting in the direction of the chair umpire during the second set of his four-set victory over Petr Korda on Thursday night. Agassi has now accumulated $4,000 in Grand Slam tournament fines, leaving him just $3,500 short of the total necesary to disqualify him automatically from the next Grand Sslam event, the 1991 Australian Open. Agassi denied cursing or spitting at the umpire, Wayne McKewan, but after reviewing videotapes of the incident, officials assessed the fine for what they called ''unsportsmanlike conduct, audible obscenities and spitting.''
