Advertisement  Cody Risien, a right tackle with the Cleveland Browns for 11 seasons, announced yesterday that he was retiring because of family responsibilities and a string of injuries and operations. Risien was a seventh-round draft pick in 1979 out of Texas A&M and played in 146 games for Cleveland, 140 as a starter. His most recent surgery was on Feb. 8, when he had bone spurs removed from his right elbow and torn cartilage in his left knee repaired.
