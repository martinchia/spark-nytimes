Much of the attention on the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first week of this season focused on whether Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook could co-exist. Talking heads are discussing whether or not they are friends, and what their recent argument means to the future of the franchise. The situation raises this question: Why do star players need to be friends? Durant, already one of the best players in the game, was on fire during the Thunderâs 4-0 start entering Saturday nightâs game against Phoenix. Averaging 31.3 points a game, he was also chipping in 7.3 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 1 block and 1 steal. Only two players have averaged 30 points, 7 rebounds, 4 assists, 1 block and 1 steal a game for a season: Bob McAdoo in 1975-76 and LeBron James in 2007-8. Westbrook, unlike his team, is off to a slow start. His 15.5 points a game looked better than his awful 8.6 player efficiency rating (15 is the league average). And his .333 shooting percentage was unacceptable regardless of whether he prefers to be a passer rather than a shooter. He seemed frustrated by his much-publicized argument with Durant in a win over the Grizzlies on Wednesday, a disagreement that started when Westbrook pushed Thabo Sefolosha to take a shot in a key situation rather than take the shot himself. But as a 23-year-old superstar who averaged 21.9 points a game and a 23.63 P.E.R last season, Westbrook is hardly near the point of needing to be considered in possible trades. It seems to be a situation unique to the N.B.A. in which a player struggling with his shot defers to a teammate, then is questioned for that decision. âI was just telling my guy to shoot the ball when he was open,â Westbrook told reporters before Thursdayâs game. âIt wasnât like I was telling him something wrong to do. Iâm telling my guy to shoot the ball, and then the rest of what was happening had nothing to do with that play.â Whatever the chemistry is between the quiet Durant and the fiery Westbrook, it helped the Thunder to 105 wins over the last two seasons, and led to a perfect record through a first week that will account for 6 percent of the teamâs season. If the team is forced to employ the old Red Sox philosophy of â25 players, 25 cabs,â then it may be worth it. A less discussed, and possibly more interesting, aspect to the Thunderâs hot start has been the strong play of James Harden, a third-year guard out of Arizona State. Coming off the bench, Harden was averaging 17.5 points a game along with 5.8 rebounds and 3 assists. He was getting to the free-throw line more than eight times a game, making 85 percent of his attempts. His P.E.R. of 24.07 was that of a superstar, not a bench player, but unlike the squabbles between Durant and Westbrook,Â no tantrums have beenÂ reported out of Harden. No Time to Lose The lockout-shortened season has already seemingly contributed to a strange start for many teams. The defending champion Mavericks began the season 0-3 before beating the Raptors on Friday night. The Celtics are also 1-3, with the teamâs only win coming against the Pistons, who were 0-3 entering Saturday. The Knicks, thought to be among the N.B.A.âs most improved teams, were 1-2 and sinking fast. Having hoped to bridge the gap to the injured Baron Davis with a ragtag group of guards headlined by Toney Douglas, Mike Bibby and the rookie Iman Shumpert, the team was dealt a blow with an injury to Shumpert (and Bibbyâs not having found a time machine). It has gotten desperate enough that the team is kicking the tires on Jeremy Lin as a potential solution. Dallas and Boston, veteran teams that have played together for years, should have no problem getting back into sync. But the shortened training camp and two preseason games are more difficult for teams like the Nets, who have had quite a bit of roster turnover. âYouâre going to see the teams that have been together for years playing better than teams that are just coming together,â Nets guard Deron Williams said Tuesday. âAs far as our team is concerned, a lot of our key guys didnât even play with us in the preseason games. Weâre still trying to learn, and we have six games in eight days and no practice — so itâs kind of hard to work on stuff.â True to what Williams feared, the Nets have lost three of four and have looked out of sorts. One team that has benefited from a cohesive lineup is the Hawks, who were 3-0 and had a league-leading scoring differential of 20.3 points a game. With four of the teamâs five starters from a year ago still together, and a surprisingly strong start from the newcomer Tracy McGrady, the team has thrived through the first week.
