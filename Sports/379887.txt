Advertisement  Saying that the "the check is no longer in the mail," JOHN ZIEGLER , president of the National Hockey League, announced yesterday the receipt of the Tampa Bay Lightning's long-awaited $22.5 million partial expansion payment. It came on the first day of the N.H.L. Board of Governors' winter meetings in West Palm Beach, Fla. While the Ottawa Senators, the other expansion team to begin play next season, made its first payment, the Tampa Bay group was having problems. The Lightning, headed by PHIL ESPOSITO , its general manager and president, missed the first deadline on June 15. But with the help of a new limited partner, GEORGE STEINBRENNER's $2.5 million investment, Tampa is back in business. Tampa's final payment of $22.5 million is due Dec. 16.
