As the United States national team heads to Russia for its final game of 2012 (10 a.m. Eastern, ESPN2), one of the players who will be hoping to make is long-awaited debut for the team is the Michigan native Joshua Gatt.  Gatt, 21, has been one of the most highly rated young players in American soccer in recent years, and on Sunday he played in Moldeâs 1-0 victory over Honefoss, which secured for Molde its second straight Norwegian Tippeligaen title. Gatt began his professional career in 2010 when he decided to forgo an N.C.A.A career at Indiana to sign with Altach of Austriaâs second tier. At first the transition to European soccer was difficult, but gradually Gatt began to dominate the league with his athleticism and speed.   In January 2011, Molde hired the former Manchester United forward Ole Gunnar Solskjaer — a former player with the club — as its coach, and one of Solskjaerâs first moves was to sign Gatt from Altach. The move paid off and in 2011 the club won its first Norwegian title. This past season the club successfully defended its title with Gatt playing a significant role. âYou never get tired or winning championships,â Gatt said. âI have been so fortunate to win two now in my young career.  It is really hard to put into words. Last year was great because Molde had never won a championship in their 100-year history. However, this one was better for one reason: itâs really tough to defend a championship.  Last year, we snuck up on some teams.  This year, everyone was gunning for us.  We always got our opponentsâ best effort.â  Gattâs rise through the U.S. Soccerâs system has been quick.  A talented high school player, he was never part of the Under-17 residency program or considered a top prospect. It wasnât until December 2010 that Gatt made his first international appearance, in a U-20 friendly against Canada. In that game, he raised eyebrows after scoring two goals and adding three assists in a 5-0 win.  Nearly two years later, Gatt has seen steady progress in his development, and he has added a technical aspect to his game to go along with elite foot speed.  âI am a much better player this year,â Gatt said.   âI would say a more complete player. Positioning, tactics and technical ability are all things that I needed to work on and improve.  I feel I have done that this year. I still have a lot to learn as a player.â    After winning the title last year, Molde qualified for European play. After falling to Basel, 2-1 on aggregate, in the final playoff round of the Champions League, Molde was placed into the Europa League’s group stages.  Molde currently sits fourth in a group that also includes Denmark’s Copenhapen and Germany’s Stuttgart. âWe are playing against some great competition and it gives you a chance to see how you and your team stack up,â Gatt said. âIf you play the game, you want to play at your highest level. Winning the league again gives us that opportunity.â The Norwegian league is not an elite league in Europe, and after winning two titles at a young age it is natural that speculation will build around Gatt’s future. Earlier this year, he signed a three-year contract extension that runs through the end of the 2015 Norwegian season.  “Playing for Ole Gunnar, there is still a ton to learn and accomplish,â Gatt explained. âSo the plan right now is to switch gears and make it out of the group stage in the Europa League.  Other than that, I am not thinking too far ahead.  I am under contract with Molde.  If other opportunities come, my agent, manager and I will sit down and weigh out those options. Until that happens, I am going to continue to try and improve as a player with Molde.â One of the biggest challenges for Gatt this year has been dealing with numerous injuries that have forced him to significant stretches of the season. In fact, he was called up for his first national team appearance in September but had to withdraw because of a pulled hamstring. The nature of the injuries forced Gatt to adjust his life on and off the field.  âInjuries, especially the ones that I was getting, are always a challenge,â Gatt said. âBut, with everything, there is a silver lining.  They have forced me to address my eating, stretching, and pre- and postgame preparation habits.  They have also resulted in a training routine that is tailored to my style of play and body.  I never want to miss games.  But I feel really good right now and am confident that with all that I have learned and incorporated into my daily routine, they are a thing of the past.â With his second Norwegian title now in hand, Gattâs incredible week will now take him to Krasnodar, Russia, where he will join the United States national team for the first time. The team has played unevenly under Coach Jurgen Klinsmann, with impressive wins over teams like Mexico and Italy but a persistent inability to score goals. Klinsmann said he hoped Gattâs inclusion would give the team an edge in quickness and pace.  With the World Cup 18 months away, now is a perfect chance for Gatt to prove that he belongs on the short list for qualifying next year.  âIt would be huge,â Gatt said of what his first cap would mean to him. âPlaying for the U.S. team as we prepare for a World Cup is the dream of most soccer players. It has been mine since I was little.   I really do not know what to expect other than that I will be on the field with some great coaches and players.  I want to show that I belong with the best that the U.S. has to offer. I know that the speed of the international game will be something that will take some time to get used to but I feel that if I do my thing, I can contribute.â Follow Brian Sciaretta on Twitter.
