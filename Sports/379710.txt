Michael Farber had to laugh. Sports Illustrated’s lead hockey writer, who is likely the most erudite of the all those chronicling the game today, had just seen an ad for Sports Illustrated’s new large-format “The Hockey Book,” which listed some of the best-known contributors. The ad listed Farber above the Nobel Prize winning author William Faulkner, whose 1955 Sports Illustrated essay “An Innocent At Rinkside” is included in the book. All Farber could think of was one of his high school English teachers, Steven E. Booth from the Moses Brown School in Providence, R.I. and how Mr. Booth’s head would likely spin if he saw Farber getting top billing over Faulkner. Booth had tried to get Farber to comprehend Faukner’s “The Sound and the Fury,” but Farber said the book was “way beyond my abilities at the time.” In fact, Farber confesses he still has problems with Faulker but acknowledges that reading the literary giant’s stream-of-consciousness style helped him figure out what Scotty Bowman was saying during the N.H.L. coaching giant’s press conferences. Faukner’s essay stands out in “The Hockey Book” as one written by an outsider, albeit a celebrated one. Everything else in this handsome book, which was edited and compiled by Sports Illustrated’s Kostya Kennedy largely from the magazine’s archives, captures the game’s emotional intensity from the inside — the grueling pressure from which goalies Terry Sawchuk and Johnny Bower need to unwind while their Maple Leaf teammates whoop it up after winning the 1967 Stanley Cup; the remorse Mike Keenan felt after berating one of his players; the jubilation Sidney Crosby felt coming home to Cole Harbour, Nova Scotia, with the Cup in 2009; the white-hot hatred the 1980 United States Olympians felt toward their coach Herb Brooks; the anger and bitterness that consumed Toe Blake as he led the Canadiens to championships.

This book has all of what you expect from that magazine at its best, especially incisive writing and glorious photography. “When people think of the magazine, hockey is not the thing that jumps out at them,” Farber says. “And one of the things I face living in Montreal is, ‘Thereâs not enough hockey in Sports Illustrated.’ For some people, thereâs not enough hockey in The Hockey News. But itâs a larger question of where hockey fits, not just in the magazine, but in North American sporting culture and I think weâre still sorting that out, and it has waxed and waned with the amount of stuff that weâve done, how weâve covered it over the years. But this book reminds you that some of the stuff is very noteworthy.” It contains memorable lines lines like E.M. Swift suggesting that Gordie Howe’s physique “might have been the prototype for Thomas Hart Benton’s murals;” Herbert Warren Wind observing that Montrealers dissect Maurice Richard goals “the way Americans used to hot-stove about Ruth’s home runs and do today about Willie Mays’s catches;” Mark Mulvoy characterizing Bobby Clarke as being “adept at squirting gasoline on incipient fires;” Leigh Montville noting that Don Cherry’s “head juts out like a hood ornament in search of a collision.” Faulkner has his lone “Innocent” essay, but each of the stories Kennedy selected is a great read, even though many had to be edited down. By selecting work by some of that magazine’s top contributors — Wind, Montville, Mulvoy, Swift, George Plimpton, Pete Axthelm, Allen Abel, Gary Smith, S.L. Price and Steve Rushin — Kennedy provides a taste of just how good hockey writing can be. And you must include Farber in that group. No learned hockey fan can avoid marveling at his wonderful use of language, the metaphors and irresistible wordplay that includes this one from the book’s introduction in which he ruminates over the iconic photo of the airborne Bobby Orr celebrating his 1970 Cup-winning goal, sent flying by Blues defenseman Noel Picard: Farber wonders if that was the origin of the phrase to be “hoisted on your own Picard.” Although he’s a wordsmith of the highest order, Farber recognizes the relative value of his tools compared to that of pictures. “The Hockey Book” is overflowing with terrific images, from the larger-than-life eyes of Dominik Hasek that stare out from behind the his goalie mask to a 19-year-old Mario Lemieux posing with real penguins to the Ducks’ George Parros preparing a roundhouse right for Chicago’s David Koci. Wisely, the book’s visual component reaches back before the 1954 debut of the magazine, so the sweep of the photography takes in much of the game’s history even if the writing does not. Many of the photographs in this book are from unusual angles — overhead, under the ice (somehow), inside the net — and that variety complements the historical sweep. Farber is especially fond of a cover shot from the magazine’s early days, showing a maskless and deeply crouched Jacques Plante facing a camera behind the other goal, readying for a point shot by the Rangers, focused on Lou Fontinato’s shot while eight rows of faces behind him in Madison Square Garden focus on it, too. “It’s a stunning hockey shot,” Farber says, “the look on the fans’ faces. I donât know why people havenât shot that angle….I find that fascinating.” There’s a lot that is fascinating about “The Hockey Book”. Is it perfect? No. Some memorable writing is not here (Farber’s 1998 piece on Bowman, Jack Falla in 1985 skating with Wayne Gretzky) and some great photography is missing too (a shot of Gump Worsley as a Ranger taken from inside the net in 1961 is one of the best). But Kennedy had to make some hard choices and had limited space. It’s hard to fault his effort. (And anyway, all the magazine’s hockey writing is searchable in the Vault section of SI.com, where you can even find the photo of Worsley, or at least some of it.) “Itâs a book that tries to capture the heart of hockey,” Farber says. “And thatâs not easy to define. “I donât want to go all Potter Stewart on you,” he adds (referencing the former Supreme Court justice who famously said of pornography, “I know it when I see it”) “But thereâs something in the photos and I suppose writing that tries to capture the heart of this game. The people who have the hockey gene understand. Maybe it preaches to the converted, but itâs arresting in some way. You look at this book and I donât know if you say, what a magnificent book, but you do say what a magnificent sport.” It’s a pretty good book, too.
