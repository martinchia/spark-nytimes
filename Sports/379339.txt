DALLAS â Dirk Nowitzkiâs sniffles and fever were essentially gone Wednesday, after a long shower, soup, tea, some food and a good nightâs sleep â rest made easier by the Dallas Mavericksâ 86-83 victory over the Miami Heat.

Nowitzki was limited to noncontact work at practice and said his illness should not be an issue for Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals on Thursday at American Airlines Center. He is also playing with a torn tendon in his left middle finger, an injury to his nonshooting hand sustained in Game 1 that requires a protective splint.
âNobody is completely healthy,â Nowitzki said. âSo itâs time to fight through some stuff, and once the game gets going, the adrenaline starts flowing. Everybody is out there and giving it their all.â
Nowitzki, battling a 101-degree fever, drilled his first three shots in Game 4, but he misfired on 13 of his next 15 attempts before his driving layup with 14.4 seconds remaining put the Mavericks ahead, 84-81. He even missed a free throw, his first misfire in 34 attempts in this series, which is tied, 2-2.

âI felt like I had an off night; I couldnât get anything going,â said Nowitzki, who finished with a team-high 21 points and had 11 rebounds, all on the defensive end. âI was able to attack a little bit there in the fourth quarter, got to the free-throw line some. But our defense was what won us the game in the fourth. To give up only 14 points to an explosive team like that was the key.â
The Mavericks responded to Nowitzkiâs debilitated state with their best defense and most balanced scoring of the series. Four other Dallas players finished in double figures, led by Jason Terry with 17 points. Center Tyson Chandler emerged Tuesday, countering the Heatâs aggression inside with 13 points and 16 rebounds.
Miamiâs Dwyane Wade was not buying into the extent of Nowitzkiâs illness.
âEveryone is injured at this time; Iâm not going to get into the fun-loving story of him being sick,â Wade said. âOnce you show up on the court, you show up on the court. Everyone is equal. Heâs a great player without all the dramatics of the stories thatâs been going on.â
