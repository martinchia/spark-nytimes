Chuck Person scored 27 points and Reggie Miller 26 for Indiana, while Glenn Rivers had 24, John Battle 21 and Moses Malone 19 for the visiting Hawks, who have won nine of 11 games. Trailing, 90-89, with 10 minutes remaining, Atlanta took the lead for good with a 16-2 run. Rivers scored 10 points and Wilkins hit a 3-pointer during the run, which gave the Hawks a 105-92 lead with five minutes left. The Pacers made the score 105-99 with 3:51 left on George McCloud's 3-pointer and Mike Sanders's two layups, but they got no closer.(AP) Trail Blazers 132, Timberwolves 117: Clyde Drexler scored 13 of his 32 points in Portland's 41-point first quarter and finished with 11 assists and 10 rebounds as the Trail Blazers set a record for the most points scored against Minnesota. Buck Williams, the league leader in field-goal percentage and Portland's top rebounder, injured his groin 2:31 into the game and didn't return for the Trail Blazers. The victory gave the Trail Blazers a 15-5 road record, the best in the league.(AP) N.H.L. Tocchet Reaches 30-Goal Plateau Rick Tocchet scored two of Philadelphia's four first-period goals last night as the Flyers defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins, 5-4. Tocchet, selected to start for the Wales Conference in Saturday's All-Star game, leads Philadelphia with 30 goals. This is the fourth season in a row that he has scored at least 30. Tocchet has 13 points in his last 10 games. The victory, Philadelphia's second in its last seven games, snapped a seven-game (0-4-3) streak without a victory for the Flyers. Pittsburgh was 12-4 in its previous 16 games with Tom Barrasso, the Pittsburgh goaltender, allowing only four goals in the previous three. Dale Kushner, Kjell Samuelsson and Mike Ricci had the other Philadelphia goals. Bob Errey, Phil Bourque, Paul Coffey and Gord Roberts scored for Pittsburgh. Philadelphia, 20-0-2 when scoring four or more goals, has beaten Pittsburgh in three of four meetings this season. Pittsburgh came into the game as the league's top-scoring team. But the Flyers, who hadn't scored more than three goals in any of their previous seven games, jumped out to the big lead. Tocchet scored on a power play at 10:37 and at even strength at 14:12. Coffey made it 4-3 when he beat Peeters on a power play at the 9:25, making him the highest-scoring defenseman in Pittsburgh history with 344 points.
