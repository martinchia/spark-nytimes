Advertisement  General Manager Neil Smith of the Rangers yesterday announced officially Mark Messier's new five-year, $13 million-plus-incentives contract, and the two also agreed that the struggling Rangers are not playing well enough to win the Stanley Cup in the spring. "There are still some holes that need to be mended," Smith said. "Hopefully, they will be mended. Our whole focus is on the playoffs." Messier said the Rangers' inconsistency "is hurting us." The Rangers, who face the Washington Capitals at Landover, Md., Friday night, have gone 6-7-1 over the last 14 games since starting the season at 11-5. On top of a $1 million signing bonus, Messier's annual salaries, retroactive to the start of this season, will be $1.75 million, $2.35 million, $2.5 million, $2.65 million and $2.75 million. According to a report in The Toronto Sun, additional incentive clauses are based on team achievements. Every time the Rangers lead the league in penalty-killing, for example, Messier would earn a $10,000 bonus. If the Rangers win the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, he would get a $60,000 bonus. If the Rangers win the Stanley Cup, Messier would reportedly get a total playoff bonus of $320,000.
