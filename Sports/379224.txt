Advertisement By ROBERT MCG. THOMAS JR. For someone who has written a baseball book aimed at fifth- to eighth-grade fans, HOWIE REISER seems curiously cavalier about raising unrealistic expectations in impressionable young minds. Yet in his book, "Jackie Robinson: Baseball Pioneer" (Franklin Watts), Reiser insists on telling how it was between youngsters and their idols in the old days, the 1950's, when Reiser was growing up on the Lower East Side, enthralled by the Dodgers and Robinson. As Reiser recalls in his preface, his mother, ROSE , became so impressed with his devotion to Robinson and to the player's off-season broadcasts that she simply picked up the phone one day, called the Dodger star at his radio office and asked if he would meet her son. Robinson (you might want to cover your childrens' eyes at this point) said yes. Which is how it came to pass that on Dec. 2, 1953, mother and son went to Robinson's office, where Robinson duly signed a baseball Reiser still has, and chatted for a while with the enchanted youngster. Advertisement "We were there an hour and a half," Reiser recalled the other day, still awed by Robinson's generosity. Then Robinson probably got tired and chased the kid out, huh? "No," Reiser said. "It was my mother who ended it. She said she had to go home and make supper for my little brother." Advertisement At least some things never change.
