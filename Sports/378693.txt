Batten down the hatches in Oklahoma, it’s bedlam time again. For those outside of the Sooner state, that means the annual football showdown between Oklahoma and Oklahoma State. It’s another installment in the heated “Bedlam Series” sports rivalry between the schools, set for Saturday night in Stillwater. This year’s game is more than the usual in-state, conference-rival epic. It’s a big clash between No. 3-ranked Oklahoma State (10-1) and No. 13 Oklahoma (9-2). Oklahoma State leads the Big 12 with a 7-1 record, while Oklahoma is tied for second with Kansas State at 6-2. A Sooners win will vault them into a share of the Big 12 regular season title with the Cowboys; a Cowboys win ends a season in style with a conference championship, as there is no postseason title game in the Big 12.

The game could come down to special teams, according to the Oklahoman. Oklahoma redshirt freshman Michael Hunnicutt and Oklahoma State junior Quinn Sharp will be under the hot spotlight, if the game indeed comes down to kicking. Hunnicutt, who took over from injured senior Jimmy Stevens early in the season, has hit 18 of 21 field goals. He missed two in the 41-38 home loss to Texas Tech on Oct. 22, but said the experience taught him a lesson. Hunnicutt missed a 28-yard field goal, off the right upright, with 2 minutes 52 seconds left. Oklahoma, then ranked third in the country, had its 39-game home winning streak snapped by the loss. âIt was a good learning experience to know how bad it feels,â Hunnicutt told the Oklahoman. âI don’t want to feel like that again. I just didn’t get through it, didn’t finish that kick.â Sharp can relate to the sting of missing a big field goal, as he couldn’t hit the potential game-winner with 1:17 remaining in regulation against Iowa State on Nov. 18. He’s hit 17 of 20 field goals, but that one could have averted the 37-31 double-overtime road loss, which still looms large to the Cowboys. His field goal went high over the goal posts, cruising by the right upright, but was deemed by officials to have not met the rule of having the entire football passing “to the inside edge of the upright, extended indefinitely above the top of the upright.” Cowboys Coach Mike Gundy thinks Sharp will not be adversely affected by that miss. “He’s fine,â Gundy said. âIt hurts (him) like everybody else. After that game, everything hurts. But he’s OK. He practiced well last week.â
