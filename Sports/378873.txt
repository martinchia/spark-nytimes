Martaâs five-year run as the top female player in the world came to an end Monday in Zurich when FIFA awarded its Ballon dâOr to midfielder Homare Sawa, who helped Japan win the Womenâs World Cup last summer in Germany.  Sawa, 33, broke Martaâs run of awards, which began in 2006. Sawa and her Japanese teammates defeated the United States in a riveting final that was not settled until a penalty-kick shootout. The American striker Abby Wambach was among the three finalists for the award. Sawa is the fourth woman to win the award, though it has been handed out 11 times. Mia Hamm won the first two, in 2001 and 2002. Then Germany’s Birgit Prinz won three in a row and Marta won five. Sawaâs national team coach, Norio Sasaki, won the award as the top womenâs coach in the world. Pia Sundhage, the United States coach, and Bruno Bini, Franceâs coach, were the other finalists. On the menâs side, Barcelona striker Lionel Messi won his third consecutive Ballon dâOr, having led his club to a championship in La Liga in Spain, a second Champions League title in three years and the championship of the Club World Cup last month in Japan.

Messi joined Michel Platini as the only players to win the Ballon d’Or in three consecutive years, though when Platini won it in the mid-1980s only European players were eligible. The Dutch strikers Johan Cruyff and Marco van Basten also won it three times, but not consecutively. Messiâs coach at Barcelona, Pep Guardiola, was named the menâs coach of the year, outpointing Real Madridâs JosÃ© Mourinho and Manchester United’s Alex Ferguson. Voting was held among national team coaches and captains, and selected reporters from around the world. Their picks can be found here.
