JOHNS CREEK, Ga. â Ken Mangum, the metaphorically inclined director of the golf courses at the Atlanta Athletic Club, compared the odd damaging of two greens to âcutting yourself with a razor on your wedding day.â An apparent malfunction of lawn mower brushes tore up patches of the 14th and 17th greens Wednesday night at the clubâs Highlands course, site of the P.G.A. Championship. âWe felt like our hearts had been ripped out,â Mangum said, recalling when he and his crew saw that two patches of turf, each about three feet long, were damaged during the last mowing before Round 1 of the tournament. It was a close shave for Mangum and crew, who had nurtured the course into optimal condition, only to have it nicked just before showtime. The affected areas were fortified with fresh sod. Players were allowed to seek relief if the replaced turf stood in between their putts and the holes. Mangum wrote off the accidental turf-ist case as a mystery, likely brought on by a plunge in humidity that caused the mowersâ brushes to get entangled with the grass. The mowers will operate brush-free for the rest of the week. âWeâve checked the mowers, weâve checked the people, weâve checked everything,â Mangum said. âItâs a little mystery to me why it happened. The only answer I could come up with was that the humidity changed and the brushes grabbed and dug into the green.”
