Severe thunderstorms interrupted second-round play and 11 golfers were to finish the round today, but none appeared to have a chance to place among the leaders. (AP) HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL Showdown Fizzles This year's season kicked off last night with a game many expected to be the matchup of the year. But the game between Union Endicott, the state's top team last year in a poll of New York State sportswriters, and Bellport, last year's 10th-ranked team, did not live up to expectations as Bellport won, 30-7, in Endicott, N.Y. ''This game got a bigger buildup than I expected,'' said Joe Cipp, the Bellport coach. ''The unfortunate thing about these type of games is that often one team makes a whole bunch of mistakes and the other team winds up blowing them out.'' And that's exactly what happened. Bellport converted fumbles on Endicott's first two possessions to open a 14-0 lead early in the first quarter and it coasted from there. Antonio Oferral, the Bellport quarterback and defensive back, rushed 8 times for 119 yards while scoring two touchdowns and intercepting a pass. Tennis Ivanisevic Advances Second-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia advanced to the semifinals of a tournament in Bordeaux, France, yesterday, beating Fabrice Santoro of France, 6-2, 6-3.
