 Matt Waldman is the author of The Rookie Scouting Portfolio, an 859-page testament to his depraved obsession with film analysis of rookie prospects at quarterback, running back, wide receiver and tight end. This  series counts down his top five draft prospects at each position.  4.	Greg Little, North Carolina (6-2, 231) Letâs get this out of the way now: Greg Little is a risky pick because he has demonstrated a high level of immaturity, which will probably drop his draft stock. Little wonât be given a lot of slack, and if he doesnât mature quickly, his opportunities to play in the N.F.L. could go south quicker than he can impress an observer with his tremendous skills.  However, if an organization (or fantasy owner) is in a position to take a chance on greatness because it has a strong group of core players, Little is the kind of player that can put a team over the top. His ball skills in single coverage; his athleticism; and his running-back mind-set after the catch are special. These talents alone can draw comparisons to Anquan Boldin and Dez Bryant.  Little possesses a basketball playerâs knack (which he was at U.N.C.) for adjusting to the ball in the air. After the catch, Little has the vision, balance, power and cutting ability of a feature back (which he also was at U.N.C). Little also plays with a great deal of intensity and desire to dominate.

But Littleâs intensity all too frequently crossed the line with outbursts that are both a distraction and a source of penalties. I have watched him remove his helmet on the field, shout at teammates over mistakes, punt the football into the stands after scoring, and taunt a defender he put on the ground with a great block. In the last example, Little didnât know that he had hurt the defender severely. He stood over him running his mouth. The lack of control over his emotions will become a problem if he doesnât learn to harness it.  Little didnât do his draft status any favors by lying to N.C.A.A. investigators last summer, costing him his remaining eligibility. He has first-round talent, but the childish displays of a journeyman free agent. If he puts it all together, he has a shot to be as productive as any receiver in this draft, and only A.J. Green and Julio Jones match or exceed his physical potential. The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
