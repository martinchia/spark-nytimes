The Quad asked readers to submit recipes for football tailgating parties, and the response made us hungry for some football, but mostly just plain hungry.  We’ll give you a dish or two to try each week, starting with a bratwurst stew from Vivian Henoch, a fan of the Wisconsin Badgers. Henoch writes: “Throw me a brat and a brew, and Iâll tell you a thing or two about Madison, Wisconsin, where I learned to consume both in liberal quantities. Here goes the revelation of my vintage: another olâ Boomer, coming of age in those heady years during the late 60s and early 70s. “Fast forward: today the touristy and chirpy State Street Brats, a sports bar and grill, bears little resemblance to the Brat Haus of my memory, a Madison institution, serving brats, cheese curds, and beer since the ’30s, 40 years before I set foot through its doors. “It would seem there’s no end to instruction and protocol for preparing, serving and sharing the perfect brat experience: to chill or not to chill the brats before cooking? To prick or not to prick the meat? To simmer in beer before or after the grilling? Yellow mustard or DÃ¼sseldorf brown? Bun or Bavarian roll? Light beer or dark? “To get your juices really flowing, I suggest a stew.” It’s not too late to contribute your own dish. Use this form to send us your recipes, and please include a picture of your fare and perhaps an interesting back story.  Prep time: about an hour before the game.
