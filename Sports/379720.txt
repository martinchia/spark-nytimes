The first game of the match between David Nalbandian and Lleyton Hewitt foreshadowed what would unfold over the next 4 hours 48 minutes of this gorgeous, gutsy first-round match. With Nalbandian serving, Hewitt played with brio to gain four break points.  Each time, Nalbandian staved off the break with service placements and sterling all-court play to hold in that first game. Hewitt continued to put pressure on Nalbandianâs serve, and finally secured one break to win the first set. Hewitt also led, two sets to one, but could not put away the burly Nalbandian. Remarkably, at the end of the match each player had won 193 points. But the statistic that will haunt Hewitt is his low percentage of break point conversions. He earned 30 break points, but capitalized on only 7 of them. Nalbandian, by contrast, won 6 of 12 break points. In a match this close, failing to convert on 23 break points (one shy of an entire set!) has to wear on oneâs confidence. But it also speaks to Nalbandianâs resilience and competitive resolve.  For long stretches of the match Hewitt had the upper hand. The crowd, buoyed by earlier wins by Aussie players (Sam Stosur, Alicia Molik and Bernard Tomic all came through), tried to lift Hewitt at every difficult moment. He led by a set twice, but Nalbandian battled back to force a fifth set.  He served for the match at 5-4, but Hewitt raised his level of play to gain his seventh service break of the match. At 5-5, Nalbandian moved to double break point at 15-40 with heavy, well-disguised groundstrokes, and a punishing inside out forehand approach that wrong-footed Hewitt. But this time Hewitt fought through the break points, and when he held serve the crowd roared its approval. At this point, Hewitt looked revived. Nalbandian, who always seems to carry some extra weight around the middle, had to have been thinking of his five set loss to Hewitt here in 2005. But he did not back down, and after Hewitt held at 6-6, it was all Nalbandian.
