We have heard so little coming out of India about the state of the new Formula One track, where the Indian Grand Prix will take place next week, that we had to see it for ourselves.  Compared with all the doom-saying that led up to the inaugural Korean Grand Prix last year, the Indian event just outside New Delhi is being kept very low-key.  The Red Bull team on Friday released video of one of its drivers, Neel Jani, taking a spin on the track, the first such drive for a Formula One car.   It ended any doubt that there is a track.  But it will be interesting to see the state of the track a week from now.  I, personally, have never seen such a dusty surface — I imagine they will clean it off — and the  asphalt track looked very bumpy.  The grandstand and other facilities look fabulous, however, and the layout of the track looks wonderful as well, with massive elevation changes (for a new circuit).
