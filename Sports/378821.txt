All through the baseball playoffs, Mike Tanier will provide the Bats blog with daily updates on less-than-important developments from around the league. The World Series is a great event, but it is not a culinary event. The Super Bowl is a time for midwinter parties as well as an opportunity for food writers to trot out their latest interpretations of what football fans (a species many food writers have never met) want to eat. These recipes often involve insane fusions (Buffalo wing pot sticker soufflÃ©), unnecessary inversions of the natural order (vegan bratwurst), or just attempts to rob the event of all joy by being stridently health conscious (one memorable recipe replaced the avocados in guacamole with purÃ©ed peas.) The World Series is spread over several days, so there is no one big party event, and therefore no need to refill the recipe cards. Still, some writers are trying. Barely.  Austin Chang of Yahoo may have created the greatest parody of a recipe column ever, or he may simply have betrayed a lack of culinary imagination, when he provided detailed instructions for making seasoned popcorn, crispy tortilla chips and Chicago-style hot dogs. Notice that the seasoned popcorn is seasoned with salt. And the primary ingredient in the tortilla chips is tortilla chips. And that you can top the Chicago hot dogs with anything you want, though a real Chicago hot dog is topped with relish, cucumber, diced tomato and various other desperate attempts to make it distinct from every other hot dog. Yes, this is a parody. I hope. Feeling guilty about the previous column, Yahoo gave Jeanne Rose a chance to post her own World Series recipes. Springboarding from Changâs âHow to Open a Milk Cartonâ approach to cuisine, Rose starts by explaining how to roast peanuts. Rose is cost-conscious, and notes that a couple pounds of peanuts cost only a few bucks. She does not point out that you will have to buy a new $300 vacuum cleaner to get rid of the shells, unless you have nothing but obsessively tidy friends. Rose then ramps up the difficulty level with cheese straws and chicken nachos. She notes that the cheese straws require a âfood processor, cookie press and cookie sheet” and that “you can buy these items at your local grocery store or retail store for about $30.â First, some sound advice for everyone: if you do not own a baking sheet, it is too late to start planning this yearâs home-cooked World Series dinner fete. The learning curve from âI donât own kitchen basicsâ to âletâs invite the boss over and feed him homemade cheese strawsâ is just insurmountable. Second, while it is in fact possible to find name-brand food processors for $29.95, that only leaves a nickel for the baking sheet and cookie press, not to mention things like knives and spoons, which a good party host cannot be without. In the spirit of these recipes, I offer my own surefire party specialty: assorted miniature paninis, with tomato and mozzarella salad, and stuffed long hots. Directions: Call local caterer. Order these items. Await their arrival. Serve. Your guests will thank you, especially if the alternative is popcorn. A Friendly Wager: While on the subject of food and drink, itâs time for another time-honored World Series tradition: the âbetâ betweenÂ  politicians from each city. Representative William Lacy Clay Jr. of Missouri, and Representative Joe Barton of Texas, have the usual regional specialties riding on the game. Rep. Clay has put up a case of Budweiser and a deep dish pizza from the St. Louis restaurant Pi. Rep. Barton anted up a case of Lone Star and some brisket from Spring Creek Barbeque in Arlington, Tex. Now, after reading about how to make popcorn and contemplating a dinner party hosted by someone who just bought her first baking sheet, take a moment to savor the concept of Texas brisket. Hereâs a visual aid. Yes, those are ribs. Itâs all good. Lone Star, meanwhile, is not to be confused with Alamo, the fictitious beer of choice for the gang in Arlen. I have never had Lone Star, but as a football writer, I have had enough of Pittsburghâs Iron City to know that offering it to someone is more threat than bet. The folks in St. Louis have it easy when it comes to selecting the local brew. The food is another matter. Chicago hot dogs? Deep dish pizza? The Cubs finished 71-91, folks. The deep dish selection is made worse by the fact that there is, in fact, St. Louis style pizza. It has a cracker-thin crust and is cut into rectangles, not wedges. It sounds like something Tony La Russa thought of while considering whether to bat his pitcher seventh, but it is real. There are also Gerber sandwiches, which contain no baby food. The Gerber is really hot ham and provolone with good public relations, so not only could a congressman easily offer it up for a wager, but you need only Yahoo-approved cooking skills to make one. The secret ingredient of most St. Louis recipes is Provel cheese, which originated in a deli in the Italian-American district called the Hill. The Hill was the birthplace of Yogi Berra and Joe Garagiola, so you know Provel is World Series and Cardinals appropriate. Then again, according to TheKitchn.com: âProvel, like American cheese, doesn’t meet the F.D.A.’s requirements for moisture content in cheese, so it’s labeled as a âpasteurized processed cheese,â but that doesn’t stop anyone from enjoying its taste.â It is also hard to find outside St. Louis, which, judging from that last sentence, is not a bad thing. If the World Series goes seven games, feel free to enjoy some Budweiser and brisket. You will be getting the best of both worlds.
