Advertisement  HE came up a free throw short of a chance to end his 34-year coaching career with his 600th victory, but the way Abe Lemons of Oklahoma City saw it after a 78-77 loss to Oklahoma Christian on Friday night, the close call was something of a relief. ''It makes you glad you're not in it anymore,'' the 67-year-old Lemons said after Oklahoma Christian sank the winning shot after a disputed foul with 4 seconds to go in the first round of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics District 9 playoffs. ''That foul wouldn't have killed a gnat.'' Lemons, who also coached at Pan American and the University of Texas, finished with a career record of 599-343.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
