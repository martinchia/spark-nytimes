In a recent Keeping Score column, Dan Rosenheck makes the case that the Dodgers did not make out so badly as commonly believed when they signed Kevin Brown to a $105 million, seven-year deal in 1998. In it, he quoted Maury Brown, who runs the Web site Biz of Baseball and who takes a more negative view of the deal. Maury Brown continues the discussion over at his site: 
In fairness, the contract that former Dodgers GM Kevin Malone brokered with Brown may not be the worst long-term deal ever offered a pitcher, but itâs remembered as the beginning of them. Mike Hampton… Barry Zito… there have been others. The point is, any GM worth their salt wouldnât engage in contracts of such length unless that was an exit plan, or at the very least options that include the bullpen.
