Advertisement  For Wesleyan, the setting was perfect: The team was unbeaten through six games with two to play, it was homecoming day at Andrus Field before a crowd of 5,500 -- big by Wesleyan standards -- and a victory over Williams would have given the Cardinals their first outright Little Three championship since 1970. Well, the best Wesleyan can do now is share the Little Three title, because Williams (6-1), romped today, 54-16. In a game that was regarded as a tossup, Williams' margin of victory was the largest ever by either team in the 99 games the schools have played since 1881. A victory over Amherst next Saturday will give Williams its eighth straight Little Three championship. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
