Brian Burke, a former Navy pilot who has taken up the less dangerous hobby of N.F.L. statistical analysis,   operates  Advanced NFL Stats, a blog about  football, math and human behavior.  The Steelers and the PackersÂ  are about as evenly matched as two teams can be. By the beginning of November, they were solidly planted in the top five in team efficiency rankings, often swapping the No. 2 and No. 3 spots, where they ended the regular season. One team is better in passing, while the other is better at stopping the pass. One teamâs offense throws fewer interceptions, while the other teamâs defense gets more interceptions. Here are how each teamâs most predictive efficiency statistics, including the playoffs,  compare: The most pronounced difference between the teams appears to be run defense. The Steelers have by far the leagueâs best run defense, while the Packers are slightly below average. Nearly as stark is the difference in defensive interceptions; the Packers have a large advantage. But defensive interceptions tend to be less reliably predictable than most other stats, so they are not weighted as heavily in the prediction model. Taking all these numbers and weighting them according to their predictive power produces a game probability that favors the Steelers about 0.51 vs. 0.49. However, once each teamâs strength of schedule is taken into account, Pittsburghâs edge softens ever so slightly, making it a 0.505 vs. 0.495 matchup.

Since this is the Super Bowl, letâs go a step further and just look at Ben Roethlisbergerâs and Aaron Rodgersâ passing statistics instead of their teamsâ statistics. Roethlisberger missed four games because of  a suspension and Rodgers missed nearly two because of a concussion. Roethlisbergerâs net passing efficiency was 6.9 Yards Per Attempt (YPA), and he posted a 1.6% interception rate. Rodgers had a 7.4 YPA with  an interception rate of 2.3%. Replacing the team stats with the starting quarterbacksâ stats, we get an unfathomably even result, needing four significant digits to discern the favorite. At the risk of hyper-precision, the final numbers come to 0.5007 for the Steelers and 0.4993 for the Packers. There are other circumstances that the statistics arenât aware of, however. The Steelersâ starting center, Maurkice Pouncey, is badly injured and unlikely to play. The game is on turf and indoors, where the Packers appear to thrive. Itâs understandable that the consensus gives a slight edge to the Packers. But I suspect there are two other considerations that may be tipping the conventional wisdom in favor of Green Bay. In recent weeks, the Packers beat the Falcons and the Bears decisively while playing on the road, while the SteelersÂ  had some trouble beating  the Ravens and the Jets at home. But those victories over Atlanta and Chicago were not such great feats, at least according to efficiency stats. The Falcons were rated 20th and the Bears   14th in team efficiency for the regular season. The Ravens and the Jets were rated sixth and eighth. Those were recent games, and many experts may be forgetting that the Packers lost to the Redskins, the Dolphins and the Lions (and beat DetroitÂ  by only 2 points in Week 4). They lost to the Bears in Week 3 and beat them by only 7 points at home in Week 17, when the Bears had virtually nothing to play for and the Packers were playing for their playoff lives. People intuitively generate probabilities of future events based on how easily they can recall similar examples of the events, and people most easily recall more recent events than more distant ones. This is a cognitive bias known as the recency effect. Of course, recency has merit in sports analysis. Teams improve and decline, players are injured (or return from suspension). But my hunch is that both fans and experts alike are susceptible to emphasizing  recent games more than is warranted. My prediction for Sundayâs big game is that the winner will beâ¦the fans. As trite as that sounds, thatâs exactly what the numbers are telling us. Weâve been treated to some epic Super Bowls in recent years, and although there are no guarantees, chances are this one will be no exception. The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
