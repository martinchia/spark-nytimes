Last seasonâs statistical line for Austin da Luz, selected 14th over all by the Red Bulls in the 2010 Major League Soccer draft, is stark: a long series of zeros. That changed last Saturday night, when the club found itself without six players who were away with their national teams. Coach Hans Backe, arm firmly twisted behind his back, gave da Luz, a San Diego native, his first start in league play. Da Luz acquitted himself well by keeping it simple and keeping it solid. After the match, da Luz, 23, acknowledged that it was hard to be encouraged by his play after the Red Bulls allowed Columbus to score a late equalizer. âItâs hard to forget the result, it feels like a loss,â da Luz said of the 1-1 tie. âPersonally, I got comfortable on the field and I think I held my own. Before the game, Hans just told me to keep it simple and express myself.â  If anything, da Luz kept it too simple on the midfieldâs left flank. His play during the first half brought some halftime advice from Backe. âIt was his first game, and I wanted to keep it simple and safe, and I was happy to see him do it for 90 minutes,â Backe said. âBut I told him that when he should, he could go forward. His play earns another start.â Da Luz said he knew that he is probably headed back to the bench once players begin trickling back during the Gold Cup. âThatâs the reality,â he said. âIâll do what I can to help right now when Iâm needed.â Notes Â¶ The M.L.S. team in the middle of the country has a new name (Sporting Kansas City) and a new stadium (Livestrong Sporting Park), which is scheduled to open Thursday in a nationally televised game against Chicago. Sporting began the season with 10 road games (1-6-3). The stadium is named after Lance Armstrongâs nonprofit cancer foundation.
