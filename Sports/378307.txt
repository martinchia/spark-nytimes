Barkley was 15 of 25 from the field. Hawkins, a flop in last season's playoffs as a rookie, was 11 for 21 from the field and made all 11 of his free throws.

Johnny Dawkins followed Gminski's play with a steal and a basket to make the score 101-96 with 4 minutes 5 seconds to go. The closest Cleveland got after that was 101-98 and 103-100 with 3:18 left. Dawkins and Hawkins followed with baskets to increase Philadelphia's lead to 107-100. The Cavaliers, after an injury-plagued regular-season start, won their last 6 games and 17 of 23 to reach the playoffs for the fourth consecutive year.
