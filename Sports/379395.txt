CreditTimes Wide World Photos/The New York Times         When Augusta National Golf Club opened in 1933, there were few hints at the grandeur of its future. Bobby Jones, having retired from golf as an amateur at age 28, wanted a place to play golf in private. After winning 13 major titles, he was swarmed at any golf course he strolled on to, so he sought a course of his own, where he could invite his friends to join as members. Clifford Roberts, an investment banker and friend, helped him acquire the 385 acres that would become Augusta National and together they steered their little club into history. They started the Augusta National Invitational in 1934, which would become the Masters and one of golf’s four majors. That status eventually rattled Augusta out of its most exclusionary membership policies: it invited its first black members in the 1990s and its first female ones in 2012. Its fate was transformed by the star golfers who used the Masters as their big stage, players like Byron Nelson, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods. But the club has also tried to hang on to a bit of its old-time feel, as well as its lofty sense of self-importance. That, it seemed, began before the first golf ball was struck. Writing in 1933, The Associated Press described Augusta’s debut: “After three years of work the Augusta National Golf Club will officially open with a gala golf party bringing together famous personages of the golf and business world, Friday, Jan. 13, 1933, Augusta, Ga. The 18 hole course, built on a 385 acre nursery tract, is a veritable paradise of semitropical foliage. None other than Robert Tyre (Bobby) Jones, King of Golfers, and President of the club was behind every blue print and literally every shovel full of dirt during the construction of the course, collaborating with Dr. Alister MacKenzie, famous Scot Golf architect. Many of the 18 holes are prototypes of famous holes of the St. Andrews and North Berwick courses in Scotland and other courses throughout the world. This course, says President Jones, fulfills four fundamental requirements of golf. 1) It requires as much mental effort as it does golfing skill. 2) It gives the average player an excellent chance to do his best, while the expert must bring all his resources into play to keep within par 72. 3) It gives pleasure to the greatest number of golfers. 4) It contains natural hazards and more natural beauty than any course in the world. The Augusta National Golf Club is nonprofitmaking and under the Jones influence will be used for golf and golf only — no social functions being permitted.” We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
