NO. 3 OREGON VS. NO. 4 LOUISIANA STATE, ARLINGTON, TEX. 8 p.m., ABC Befitting an off-season marred by controversy, the first marquee matchup of the yearÂ featuresÂ  teams that spent the summer in the headlines for all the wrong reasons. L.S.U. will be without starting quarterback Jordan Jefferson (suspended after a bar fight) and receiver Russell Shepard (suspended for an N.C.A.A. rules violation). The senior quarterback Jarrett Lee, who started as a freshman, will replace Jefferson. Oregon will be without Cliff Harris, an ace returner and cornerback, who was suspended for driving 118 miles per hour on a suspended license. Quarterback Darron Thomas was in the car, but was not suspended. Oregon running back LaMichael James begins his Heisman campaign; a big game in prime time would get that going in the right direction. Last season, it was a tough Southeastern Conference defense (Auburnâs) that kept the Ducks from winning a national title. On Saturday, Oregon, which lost several starters on the offensive line, will face a nasty L.S.U. defensive front led by end Lavar Edwards. NO. 5 BOISE STATE VS. NO. 19 GEORGIA, ATLANTA 8 p.m., ESPN Boise State has gone from being everyoneâs favorite underdog to contending for national titles. The Broncos have done that by excelling against elite competition whenever they get the chance. A notable exception came in 2005, when Georgia routed Boise, 48-13. The Bulldogs may still count themselvesÂ amongÂ the big boys of college football, butÂ last seasonâs 6-7 record has Coach Mark Richt feeling the heat. Over the last two seasons, Broncos quarterback Kellen Moore,Â  a top Heisman contender, has thrown 74 touchdowns with just 9 interceptions. SOUTH FLORIDA AT NO. 16 NOTRE DAME 3:30 p.m., NBC Skip Holtz leads the Bulls into South Bend, where his father was the last man to win a national title with the Irish. U.C.L.A. AT HOUSTON 3:30 p.m., Fox Sports (Regional) A chance to watch quarterback Case Keenum, who has put up showy numbers for the Cougars. BRIGHAM YOUNG AT MISSISSIPPI 4:45 p.m., ESPN B.Y.U. is a popular sleeper pick, but Oxford can be very hot this time of year.
