Advertisement  After weeks of bitter debate and charges of race and class betrayal, an agreement was reached today that will allow construction of a $207 million Olympic stadium and its conversion after the 1996 Summer Games to a baseball park for the Atlanta Braves. In a 6-1 vote, the Fulton County Commission approved an agreement that will permit construction of an 80,000-seat stadium just south of downtown Atlanta and adjacent to the existing Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium. The facility would be used during the Games, then would be remodeled into a 45,000-seat park for the Braves. Olympic officials have said construction would start almost immediately.

The team said it would contribute $300,000 to a neighborhood improvement fund and would pay that fund 8.25 percent of its receipts from the parking lots. Another key in the compromise was the promise of more hiring of black executives by the Atlanta committee and by the Braves.                    --------------------       Milan Withdraws Bid MILAN, Italy, March 10 (AP) Milan is withdrawing its bid for the 2000 Olympic Games, the city's sports commissioner said today, declaring that Milan's image had been sullied by political corruption.
