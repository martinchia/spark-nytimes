	There is sad news about Gary Carter, the Hall of Fame catcher and a hero of the 1986 World Series for the Mets. Carterâs daughter wrote on the familyâs Web site Thursday that her fatherâs doctors had discovered âseveral new spots/tumors on his brain.â The Daily News called his condition âextremely grave,â and said doctors were deciding whether to continue his cancer treatments. 	It is heartbreaking, of course, as it would be for anyone fighting for his life at age 57. It also makes me wish I had known Carter better. By all accounts, he is gracious and kind, an antidote to the gruff, hard-living Mets of his era. He is also religious, and you have to believe that is helping to comfort him now.  	Carterâs faith stands out from my only real memory of meeting him. It was in the early 1990s, and I was writing a story about the famous sixth game against the Red Sox in that 1986 World Series. Carter, as Mets fans surely remember, came up with two outs and the bases empty, down two runs to Boston in the bottom of the 10th inning. One more out, and the Red Sox would be champions. I asked Carter to relive the moment. 	âThe biggest thing that was going through my mind is that I reflected back upon my days in the alleyway dreaming about this,â Carter said. âYou always think World Series, bottom of the ninth, two outs, that kind of stuff. 	âAnd then, I felt an extreme presence and I knew that our good Lord was with us. I felt like when I went up to the plate, I was not going to make the last out. I prayed from the time I left the on-deck circle to the time I got in the box.â  Carter lashed a single off Calvin Schiraldi, scored on a single by Ray Knight, and celebrated â in shin guards and chest protector — when the Mets capped their comeback. The next game, Carter squeezed the final strike when Jesse Orosco fanned Marty Barrett to clinch Game 7. Carter thrust his arms in the air, raced to the mound and leaped on Orosco to start the most raucous dogpile baseball had ever seen. It is how Mets fans will remember him, a champion on top of the pile. Nobody knows what God had to do with it. But Carter believed, and that seems important now.
