Algeria, which finished second to Belgium in Group H, was the last advancing team to secure a spot in the Round of 16. Its progress, along with that of Nigeria, which qualified Wednesday, means Africa has two teams in the second round for the first time. The Algerians play Germany on Monday. The victory had Coach Vahid Halilhodzic shaking his head in apparent disbelief. “Algeria played a heroic match, and our qualification is perfectly deserved,” he said. Russia, needing a win to advance, went on the attack from the start and dominated the first half with its intricate and swift passing through the midfield. The Russians took the lead in the sixth minute when Aleksandr Kokorin powerfully headed in a cross.  Slimani scored in the 60th minute after Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev failed to catch a swinging left-footed free kick from Yacine Brahimi.  However, there were indications on the TV broadcast that a green laser was directed toward Akinfeev just before the free kick was taken. Russia Coach Fabio Capello said his keeper was “blinded by the laser beam.” Failure to advance put pressure on Capello. Russia will host the 2018 Cup.
