INDIANAPOLIS–Sigmund Freud probably never said âsometimes, a cigar is just a cigar,â and he probably never thought it, either. A cigar is many things: a symbol either of congratulation or of luxurious excess and the privilege of power; a capstone to an evening of manly pursuits; an unmistakable assault of the senses that is both attractive and repulsive, as well as decadent, overindulgent and a little unhealthy. The Super Bowl itself, then, is like the fine cigar at the end of the football season. So it is only natural that there are several cigar-related activities in Indianapolis this week, including the Super Cigar Lounge IV at Subterra, a tavern on the fringe of the Super Bowl village. Super Cigar Lounge IV was an intimate, 200-person fund-raiser benefiting Good Sports Inc., a nonprofit organization that donates athletic equipment and supplies to needy schools. This yearâs event raised more than $8,000 for Broad Ripple High School, alma mater of the Purdue University and New England Patriots defensive end Roosevelt Colvin, the guest of honor. âMy senior year, we had no home football fields,â said Colvin, who does not smoke. âI played all my games away. I probably had the same cleats for two or three years. I want these kids to understand that they donât have to settle for less.â Colvin received an award from Good Sports for his charitable efforts. âHe does tremendous things for the community, so we wanted to recognize his work,â said Good Sports market director Morgan Coleman, who also does not smoke. Tiant Cigar Group, founded by the son of the Red Sox legend Luis Tiant, provided several boxes of complimentary cigars for the event. The company’s president andÂ co-owner,Â Michael L. Bellody, who does smoke, was on hand to explain its El Tiante Habano Rosado and Habano Oscuro blends. âTheyâre both medium-to-full bodies. The Oscuro is going to be a little bit stronger and more peppery.â The El Tiante line began shipping in October. The Rosado drew high marks from cigar aficionado Ken White, a pharmacist and part-time bartender who works at The Cigar Bar, a crosstown tavern that will host a similar event on Saturday. âI taste cream, leather and some spice,â White said, taking the final puffs of a Rosado before sampling an Oscuro. âNext, I expect some pepper, some spice and some kick.â White claimed to not be a cigar expert, though his tasting notes suggested otherwise. âI have always preferred the flavor profile of Nicaraguan blends,â he said. (El Tiante cigars are of the Nicaraguan variety). âThough some of my friends are trying to seduce me over to the Davidoff side.â There were no Davidoff cigars in sight at Subterra: Tiant Cigar Group was an exclusive supplier for the event. Sports Identity Inc., a Boston-based sports and event management company, has organized Super Cigar Lounge events in Super Bowl host cities for the last four years. âItâs a unique event,â the company’s managing partner, Josh Boyle, Â said. âItâs not your usual cocktail reception.â While a handful of tickets were sold to the public, most of the guests were invitees of Sports Identity or one of eventâs various local sponsors and partners. Each host city provides unique challenges, Boyle said. Miami provided outstanding weather and an outdoor setting. âWe went from 11 in the morning until 11 at night,â he said. âWe roasted a pig.â Like everything else at last yearâs Super Bowl in Dallas, Super Cigar Lounge III was nearly ruined by the weather and was forced to close early. Indianapolis is a cigar-friendly city, which turned out to be a mixed blessing: Nicky Blaine’s, the most prominent cigar lounge in downtown, was booked for a larger, more-exclusive cigar event on Thursday. Subterra turned out to be a very suitable replacement. As its name suggests, it’s a downstairs lounge, beneath a Mexican restaurant. The ambience is dark, intimate and invitingly shadowy, with a handful of secluded booths. An increasingly thick haze of smoke gave the lounge a speakeasy vibe that contrasted with the state fair atmosphere of the Super Bowl village just outside. âEspecially in the midst of the Super Bowl, where there are crazy amounts of people, this is a good opportunity to relax, have a cigar, mingle,â Boyle said. âEven for nonsmokers.â Nonsmoker mingling was feasible early in the event. But as the Subterra ventilation system struggled to keep up with the Nicaraguan flavor profile engulfing the room, smoky ambience became a creamy, leathery fog. Aficionados were delighted. No-smokers soldiered on for charity. âI have to make frequent trips outside,â Coleman admitted. With a Boston-based company organizing the event and a Patriots Super Bowl winner as guest of honor, rooting interests at Cigar Lounge IV were very one-sided. Colvin, no stranger to tiptoeing around rivalries as an Indianapolis native who starred for the Patriots, at least had something nice to say about one Giants player. Â âI think my man Mathias Kiwanuka is gonna have a great game,â he said. âBut not so great that he beats my team.â The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
