Advertisement  AP The powerful National Collegiate Athletic Association Presidents Commission decided today to support the far-reaching reform package schools will vote on next January at the N.C.A.A. convention. The commission's support does not guarantee passage of the many proposals, which among other things would reduce scholarships, coaching staffs and the number of games in most sports. But it should tilt the odds in favor of adoption. In their two-day meeting, the presidents also voted to toughen Proposition 48, the controversial freshman eligibility academic requirements. Academic requirements are about the only thing missing from the package that goes before schools Jan. 7-11 in what is being called ''the reform convention to end all reform conventions.''
