Advertisement  AP Doug Brien, who had not made a field goal longer than 33 yards, hit a 47-yarder with 30 seconds remaining to cap a fourth-quarter comeback that gave California a 27-24 victory over U.C.L.A. today in a Pacific-10 Conference game. The victory was the second straight over U.C.L.A. after the Bruins had beaten the Bears 18 consecutive times dating to 1971. It was over 100 degrees on the Rose Bowl field during the game. After a punt, Cal (4-0 over all, 2-0 in the conference) moved from its 40-yard line to the U.C.L.A. 29 before the drive stalled, leading to Brien's game-winner. U.C.L.A. (2-2) lost its conference opener. Cal tied at 24-24 on Russell White's second 1-yard run with 4 minutes 18 seconds left, 4 plays after Jerrott Willard recovered a fumble by Maury Toy at the U.C.L.A. 27. Advertisement White gained 121 yards on 25 carries, and Mike Pawlwaski completed 27 of 39 passes for 292 yards and a touchdown with 2 interceptions. Southern Miss. 10, Auburn 9 Advertisement AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Reserve cornerback Vernard Collins broke up a 2-point conversion pass with 1 minute 33 seconds left, and Southern Mississippi (3-2) upset Auburn for the second season in a row. Auburn (3-2) drove 58 yards for its only touchdown, a 6-yard pass from Stan White to a leaping Fred Baxter. Coach Pat Dye, who has frequently gone for ties, elected to go for the victory. White rolled out to the right and tried to pass to Tony Russell in the back of the end zone. But Collins batted the ball away. Miami 40, Oklahoma St. 3 MIAMI (AP) -- Carlos Huerta's National Collegiate Athletic Association record streak of successful points after touchdowns ended at 157, and Miami (4-0) breezed past Oklahoma State (0-4). The kick, which Huerta went wide to the right, came with the Hurricanes leading by 30-0 late in the second quarter. It marked the first time the Cowboys had stopped Miami, which got four touchdowns and a field goal on its first five possessions. Huerta kicked field goals of 27 and 29 yards. The senior had never missed a point-after kick in a regular-season game; he missed one and one was blocked in bowl games, but N.C.A.A. records do not include post-season play. Tailback Stephen McGuire suffered a sprained left ankle on on the second series and sat out the rest of the game. Freshman Larry Jones led Miami with 96 yards in 10 carries. Miami's 230 yards rushing was a season high, and the Hurricanes had 520 total yards to exceed 500 for the fourth consecutive game. North Carolina State 28, Georgia Tech 21 Advertisement RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Redshirt freshman Geoff Bender's 2-yard keeper with 2:43 left in his first start in the Atlantic Coast Conference game kept North Carolina State (5-0 over all, 3-0 in the conference) unbeaten. Bender, replacing Terry Jordan who suffered a broken wrist last week against North Carolina, completed 17 of 32 passes for 138 yards but threw 3 interceptions. Bender led the Wolfpack down the field on a 6 1/2-minute, 74-yard drive to the winning touchdown with the help of three penalties. North Carolina State would have been stopped on fourth down deep in its territory, but a pass-interference penalty gave the Wolfpack a first down. The Yellow Jackets (2-3, 1-2) were also called for a personal foul near midfield and an offside penalty on first and goal from the 4. Pitt 24, Maryland 20 PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Alex Van Pelt completed 27 of 45 passes for 353 yards and 2 touchdowns, and freshman Vince Williams scored the go-ahead touchdown on his first career carry for Pitt (5-0), which achieved its best start since opening 7-0 in 1982.

Maryland (1-3) trailed by 24-14 in the final period, but Jim Sandwisch connected with Marcus Badgett on a 58-yard scoring pass play. Sandwisch then drove Maryland to Pitt's 20 in the final minute before Doug Whaley intercepted at the 1 on fourth and 10 with 23 seconds left. Virginia 31, Kansas 19 CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Matt Blundin threw for two touchdowns and Virginia turned four Kansas turnovers into 24 points. Terry Kirby added 107 rushing yards, including a 64-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter, as Virginia (3-2) overcame a sluggish first half. Kansas got 124 rushing yards from 5-foot-6-inch tailback Tony Sands, but the Jayhawks were intercepted once and lost three fumbles in failing to reach their first 4-0 start since 1981. Virginia Tech 20, W. Virginia 14 MORGANTOWN, W. Va. (AP) -- Defensive end James Hargrove swatted the ball and the game out of quarterback Chris Gray's hands as Virginia Tech won a game delayed 50 minutes by lightning. West Virginia fell to 3-2. Advertisement With fourth and goal from the 2, Coach Don Nehlen called for an option right by Gray. The senior faked the handoff and held the ball loosely in his right hand next to his hip. Hargrove broke through and swatted the ball, which bounced into his hands, and the Hokies (2-3) ran out the remaining 16 seconds.  Oklahoma 29, Iowa St. 8 AMES, Iowa (AP) -- Cale Gundy threw three touchdown passes despite a temperature of 41 degress and a northwest wind of 18 miles an hour that created a 21-degree windchill factor. Oklahoma (4-0) limited the Cyclones (2-3) to 253 yards and had eight sacks, including seven of Chris Pedersen, who had engineered Iowa State's 33-31 upset of the Sooners last year. Last year, Iowa State had pushed Oklahoma for 609 total yards in a 43-40 loss. East Carolina 56, Akron 20 GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Jeff Blake threw for four touchdowns, and East Carolina (4-1) scored a school-record 42 points in the first half to achieve its best start since 1983, when it won five in a row after losing the opener. The Pirates set a school record with six passing touchdowns, surpassing the previous mark of four. Blake, Michael Anderson and Orlando Whitaker completed 26 of their 41 attempts with no interceptions for 290 yards. Ohio St. 31, Wisconsin 16 COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Raymont Harris ran for two touchdowns and the defense shut down Wisconsin's rushing game for the victory before 94,221, the largest crowd in Ohio Stadium history. Harris helped the Buckeyes reach 4-0 for the first time since 1984, on touchdown runs of 1 and 6 yards. Terrell Fletcher ran for 29 yards on Wisconsin's second play, but the Badgers (3-1) were limited to minus-1 yard on 17 rushes the rest of the day in the Big Ten opener for the teams. Ohio State ran for 221 yards, led by Scottie Graham's 63 and Butler By'not'e's 62. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
