Advertisement  Not only did LARRY RINKER have a surprisingly fine British Open, finishing tied for 12th yesterday at four-under-par 284, but he made the deal of his life in connection with his other passion: music. Rinker is an accomplished guitarist who has frequently sat in on sessions and performances with pros like the GATLIN BROTHERS and STEPHEN STILLS. Like many accomplished pickers, he covets and collects vintage guitars. Knowing a weak spot when he sees it, Rinker used his connections to prey on an obsession even stronger than his own. When Stills, an inveterate golfer, was admiring a particularly handsome set of persimmon-headed woods that Rinker owned, the pro golfer made a deal the pro musician couldn't refuse. "My woods for your guitar," said Rinker, who had long lusted after Stills's handmade Takemine accoustic guitar. Stills swallowed hard but decided he couldn't pass up three vintage woods made by Jack Wulkotte, who has personally crafted Jack Nicklaus's clubs for years. "I got the better end of that deal," Rinker said before his final-round 73. "I paid $300 bucks for those woods. This guitar is worth $2000."
