Advertisement  Two of the 25 players on the Devils' roster who have seen little action in recent games were sent to New Jersey's minor league affiliate for conditioning yesterday. Tom Albelin, a defenseman, and Al Stewart, left wing, will join the Utica Devils of the American Hockey League and will miss tonight's game at Minnesota against the North Stars. Lou Lamoriello, the general manager, emphasized that it was not a demotion for Albelin, who has played 17 games and has an assist, or for Stewart, who has played 18 games and has 2 goals and 4 points. The Devils also reported that Laurie Boschman, their defensive center, is out day to day with a bruised shoulder. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
