Texans (11-6) at Ravens (12-4)
Sunday, 1 p.m. Line: Ravens by 7.5 There are some N.F.L. games that captivate the imaginations of both die-hard and casual fans, matchups between thrilling teams led by compelling superstars who play a fast-paced, innovative style of football. And then there is this game. The Texans and the Ravens are solid, sturdy and well-built, like two utilitarian storage sheds. Their fans certainly love them, and traditionalists get jazzed when the Texans execute a precise zone-stretch run or the Ravens dust off the âI-Right-32-Isoâ running play that Pop Warner coaches introduce in their first practices. But this game is a true undercard. The Ravens have been reliable playoff spackle for years, keeping the A.F.C. properly glued together by dispatching whatever first-round playoff opponents donât belong before bowing out to the real contenders in later rounds. The Texans will tell you that they are not âjust happy to be hereâ until you believe it as much as they do, but they lost, 29-14, to the Ravens when quarterback Matt Schaub was healthy in Week 6, and T.J. Yates is out of his element against the Ravensâ defense, with its old guard of future Hall of Famers and second wave of perennial Pro Bowlers. When the Ravens have the ball Handoff. Handoff. Handoff. Bomb. Handoff. Bomb. Handoff. Handoff. Replace the handoffs to Ray Rice and Joe Flacco satellite launches with dots and dashes, and the resulting Morse code spells out âpredictable.â To balance their high-low game, the Ravens mix in screen passes to Rice â he led A.F.C. running backs with 76 receptions for 704 yards â and the occasional 15-yard out-route along the sideline to Anquan Boldin. Still, the bombs are what allow the Ravens to score more than 13 points per game. Flacco was just 10 for 34 on passes that traveled over 30 yards in the air this season, but there is a hidden benefit to all of those long-distance flights: the Ravens gained 280 yards on opposing pass interference penalties, by far the highest total in the N.F.L. The Texans held the Bengals, another bomb-or-bust team, to just two pass plays of over 20 yards last week, though they were flagged for a 52-yard pass interference penalty. Defensive linemen J.J. Watt and Antonio Smith had outstanding games, but they will face a much tougher offensive line this week. When the Texans have the ball What happens on the Texansâ line stays on the Texansâ line. Arian Foster ran 24 times for 153 yards against the Bengals, with the backup Ben Tate adding nine carries for 37 yards. In their wake was a strip-logged forest of Bengals defenders who were cut-blocked, sneakily held and otherwise mauled by Eric Winston, Duane Brown and the rest of the Houston line’s rulebook-benders. The Texans played exactly the game they wanted to play against the Bengals, building a two-touchdown lead on an interception return and a long pass to Andre Johnson, then running the ball 13 times in the fourth quarter in an attempt to bury the football until the final gun. Opponents like the Jaguars and the Seahawks proved that turtle tactics can work against the Ravens, but Foster and Tate combined for just 90 yards in their last trip to Baltimore, perhaps because many Ravens defenders are old enough to remember when cut blocking was invented. Ray Lewis and Ed Reed will be enshrined in Canton if they ever retire, and while Lewis has been about half as good as his reputation for the last five years, Reed still feeds off the poor decisions of quarterbacks like some cherry-picking vampire. Yates must be wary of Reedâs ability to anticipate pass patterns, but the real difference-makers on the Ravensâ defense are tackle Haloti Ngata and the pass rusher Terrell Suggs. Ngata recorded five sacks and helped the Ravensâ defense hold opponents to just 3.5 yards per rush. Suggsâs 14 sacks tell only part of the story of how well he played: he recorded 70 total tackles, and, according to the Web site Football Outsiders, opponents averaged negative 0.2 yards on those stops. Pick Move over, Texans: the Ravens have an A.F.C. championship game to lose next week. Ravens Giants (10-7) at Packers (15-1)
Sunday, 4:30 p.m. Line: Packers by 7.5 The Promulgation of Obvious Story Lines Act (passed in 2005, when Jerome Bettis returned home to Detroit for the Super Bowl) requires us to begin this preview by pointing out the similarities between this game and Super Bowl XLII. The Packers, like the 2007 Patriots, are an offensive juggernaut that flirted with â or in the Patriotsâ case, proposed to and went apartment shopping with â an undefeated season. The Giants, like the 2007 Giants, snuck into the playoffs quietly on the strength of their defensive line. The Patriots beat the Giants, 38-35, in the final game of the 2007 season. The Packers beat the Giants, 38-35, a few weeks ago. David Tyree had a personal trainer named Lincoln. Victor Cruz has an investment adviser named Kennedy. Eli Manning is similar to Eli Manning in that they are both Eli Manning. Come to think of it, that obvious story line does contain some spooky parallels. So now, all the Giants have to do is wait for Jason Pierre-Paul and Justin Tuck to tear up the Packersâ offensive line, grab a few off-the-helmet receptions and make plans for an N.F.C. championship trip, right? That is the problem with apparent parallelisms: if they are off by just a degree or two, they can result in a collision with reality. When the Packers have the ball Jordy Nelson is having one of the most remarkable seasons by a wide receiver. Nelson caught 71 percent of the 96 passes thrown to him. Thatâs not remarkable: Wes Welker caught a similar percentage. But Welker catches many, many screens. The average pass to Nelson travels 12.6 yards in the air, and Nelson averages 18.6 yards per reception, a figure usually associated with deep threats who have low catch rates. The Packers like to isolate Nelson in single coverage along the sideline, as they did in the waning seconds to set up their winning field goal in Week 13. Opponents cannot use a deep safety to stop Nelson, because Greg Jennings, Jermichael Finley and Donald Driver stretch the coverage as far as it can possibly go. The Giants kept the game close in Week 13 by getting pressure both up the middle and off the edge. The Packers were without left tackle Chad Clifton (hamstring, back) and guard Josh Sitton (knee), both of whom will be back Sunday. Tuck and company must mind their lanes when pass-rushing: Aaron Rodgers rushed for 257 yards this season and set up a Week 13 touchdown with two timely scrambles. When the Giants have the ball The Packersâ defense is strong on the edges and weak in the middle. Outside linebacker Clay Matthews forces opponents to roll pass protection to his side of the field. Cornerback Tramon Williams is an excellent man-to-man defender, and though Charles Woodson is penalty prone in coverage (seven flags this year), he is still one of the most versatile cornerbacks in the league. But safeties Charlie Peprah and Morgan Burnett are not as good as their eight combined interceptions suggest: both have difficulty in coverage and can be turned around in the open field. Because of the complex blitzes designed by coordinator Dom Capers, inside linebackers A.J. Hawk and Desmond Bishop often have a lot of ground to cover in the middle of the field, and both give up more than their share of receptions. The Giants will use I-formations and extra tight ends to keep the Packersâ front seven packed tight at the line, opening up opportunities for the wide receivers in the deep middle of the field. Like the Packers, the Giants are healthier on the offensive line than they were in Week 13: center David Baas missed that game with a head injury but will play Sunday. The Packers allowed 4.9 yards per rush up the middle of the field, 28th in the N.F.L., and Baasâs presence will allow the Giants to stay balanced if they get any opportunities to run the ball.
