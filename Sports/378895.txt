England’s Football Association on Saturday released the 115-page report compiled by an independent commission that suspended Liverpool striker Luis SuÃ¡rez for eight games. The document lays out in painstaking detail the evidence that SuÃ¡rez directed a racist insult at a black opponent during a Premier League game in October, as well as the methods it used to go about determining his punishment. SuÃ¡rez had claimed that the intent of his words, spoken in Spanish and directed at Manchester United’s French defender Patrice Evra on Oct. 15, had been lost in translation. The F.A. rejected that explanation earlier this month, suspending him for eight games and fining him about $62,000. That decision led to an on-field protest by SuÃ¡rez’s teammates and significant discussion on this blog and elsewhere. The report released Saturday lays out the charges and the explanations. In it, the commission concludes that SuÃ¡rez, a Uruguayan, had called Evra “negro” seven times during the incident. It also called him an “unreliable” witness. In the most British way possible, the report essentially said SuÃ¡rez was not telling the truth. It summarizes the charge this way: The FA’s case, in short, was as follows. In the goalmouth, Mr Evra and Mr Suarez spoke to each other in Spanish. Mr Evra asked Mr Suarez why he had kicked him, referring to the foul five minutes previously. Mr Suarez replied “Porque tu eres negro”, meaning “Because you are black”. Mr Evra then said to Mr Suarez âsay it to me again, Iâm going to punch youâ. Mr Suarez replied “No hablo con los negros”, meaning “I don’t speak to blacks”. Mr Evra continued by saying that he now thought he was going to punch Mr Suarez. Mr Suarez replied “Dale, negro, negro, negro”, which meant “okay, blackie, blackie, blackie”. As Mr Suarez said this, he reached out to touch Mr Evra’s arm, gesturing at his skin. Mr Kuyt then intervened. Evra complained to the referee, Andre Marriner, immediately after his confrontation with SuÃ¡rez, and he and Manchester United Manager Alex Ferguson made an official complaint after the game. SuÃ¡rez responded to the charges that day, in writing, and again in later interviews with the commission. The report goes into almost excruciating detail about the two players’ versions of events, which were caught (but not conclusively) by television cameras, overheard (but not perfectly) by other players, and disputed (repeatedly) by almost everyone. The commission members viewed television footage that was not broadcast, and brought in Spanish language experts to write a report on the way certain terms are used and perceived in different cultures. (These sections may be the oddest part of the report: lawyerly discussions about terms like “negro” and “blackie” and “negre” and “noir,” and when and where it might be fine to use an expression and when it would be patently offensive to use the same word. Even more jarring are the matter-of-fact and liberal use of unprintable obscenities in a lengthy legal document.) The report also offers an intriguing window into the close-quarters action on the field, where fouls and insults are freely exchanged, rarely forgetten, and frequently debated — often in multiple languages. Evra, a Frenchman, apparently first spoke to SuÃ¡rez in Spanish; SuÃ¡rez responded in kind, but then Evra switched to English. SuÃ¡rez, who plays in England but according to his Scottish coach speaks no English, later discussed what he said with his teammate Dirk Kuyt in Dutch, the language Kuyt may or may not have used to slur Evra earlier in the game. Are you following? In the end, SuÃ¡rez acknowledged using the term “negro,” but he said he used it only once (though the unseen video clips seem to hint strongly that that was not true), that he used it in a nonoffensive manner, and further that he said it was common for him to do so: Where I grew up, the word negro is used (and has been used throughout my life by me) as a friendly form of address to people seen as black or brown-skinned (or even just black-haired). To use some examples of how this word is used: I was darker when I was younger and had very dark hair and because of this my wife calls me negro, in an affectionate way, and so do many of my friends. Similarly, I would refer to Glen Johnson as “negro” in the same way that I might refer to Dirk Kuyt as “Blondie” (because he has blond hair) or Andy Carroll as “Grandote” (Big Man – because he is very tall). Where I come from it is normal to refer to people in this way by reference to what they look like. Liverpool has 14 days to appeal the report’s conclusions. SuÃ¡rez’s suspension will not take effect until he completes any challenge, which Liverpool said Saturday it was considering. (SuÃ¡rez missed Friday’s game against Newcastle while serving a separate one-match ban for making an obscene gesture at Fulham fans in Liverpool’s previous game.) Liverpool released a statement on the SuÃ¡rez report on Saturday: “The player, the Club and our legal advisors will now take the necessary amount of time to read, digest and properly consider the contents of the 115 page judgment and will make no further comment at present.” Corner kick: Does reading the report change your opinion of Suarez’s actions in the incident with Evra, or his credibility? Does eight games still seem too much, or too few? And what will this mean for Chelsea defender John Terry, who faces charges related to similar accusations of racial abuse against an opponent?
