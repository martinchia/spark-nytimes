MILWAUKEE â Naturally the question offended Milwaukee Brewers infielder Craig Counsell, who grew up a Brewers fan in Whitefish Bay, Wis., but knows what kind of pull the Green Bay Packers exert on his fellow Wisconsinites. Sunday, in one of those scheduling quirks that make everyone wonder what the networks were thinking, the Packers kick off their game with the Denver Broncos at Lambeau Field at 4:15 p.m. Eastern time instead of the usual 1 p.m. That puts the defending Super Bowl champions head-to-head against Brewers-Diamondbacks in the second game of their division series, which is scheduled to start 22 minutes later.

So if Counsell was on the couch at home instead of in uniform for the Brewers, which game would he be watching? The question was meant lightheartedly, but Counsell never cracked a smile. âIâd be watching the Brewers,â he said. âThe Packers are always kind of a big deal here in Wisconsin, but this is a playoff game.â Counsell did not need to add that Brewer playoff games are rare; this is only the clubâs second postseason appearance since 1982. Itâs part of a huge sports weekend here in the State of Cheese, Sausages and Beer. A third component: Nebraska makes its Big Ten debut at Wisconsin on Saturday night in Madison in a matchup of nationally ranked unbeatens. The Brewers drew a 2:07 p.m. start for Game 1 and should be long done by the time the Huskers and the Badgers kick off at 8.  A Brewers spokesman said the club has no plans to prevent anyone at Miller Park with access to a television (in the suites, say) from tuning in the Packers game. John Axford, the Brewersâ closer, said heâs prepared for cheering to break out at unexpected moments, perhaps coinciding with an Aaron Rodgers touchdown pass.  âThat happens a lot,â he said. âPeople here are crazy about their sports teams. Iâm sure theyâll be people enjoying the Packers game. But at the same time, they havenât had a team like this in Milwaukee for quite awhile. I think theyâll be even more excited about our game on Sunday. âItâs been a good year for Wisconsin sports. Weâre hoping to keep it going as well.â Rodgers, by the way, has been seen wearing a Brewers cap around Lambeau. If the Brewers game runs long, the Packersâ locker room has plenty of TVs.
