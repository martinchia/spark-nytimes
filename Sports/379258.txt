2:39 p.m. | Updated with Pirates filing a complaint Baseball fans are still buzzing about the umpire’s call on a play at the plate in the bottom of the 19th inning Tuesday night that gave the Braves a 4-3 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates, prematurely ending a game that took 6 hours 39 minutes at 1:50 a.m. in Atlanta. The Braves had runners on second and third with one out, with Braves reliever Scott ProctorÂ  batting against the Pirates’ Daniel McCutchen. With the infield in, Proctor grounded to third baseman Pedro Alvarez, whose throw home to catcher Mike McKenry beat the base runner, Julio Lugo, by about five feet. The catcher appeared to make the tag and the plate umpire, Jerry Meals, called Lugo … safe. Jeff Schultz of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution captured  the madness of the night and called it “the worst call by an official in the history of professional sports,” but attributed his harsh assessment to being tired and punchy. Mark Bowman of MLB.com talked to Meals after the game, and even the umpire admitted that he might have been wrong: “I saw the tag, but he looked like he olÃ©d him and I called him safe for that. I looked at the replays and it appeared he might have got him on the shin area. I’m guessing he might have got him, but when I was out there when it happened, I didn’t see a tag. “I just saw the glove sweep up. I didn’t see the glove hit his leg.” There is much for the baseball fan to relish about the play. Watch Lugo’s body language before and after the call. Watch what Proctor does after he hits the ball. He stumbles out of the batter’s box and falls face-first to the grass. If the umpire makes the out call, McKenry would possibly have had the time, if not the presence of mind, to throw to first and complete a double play (although he appeared satisfied with just getting the second out.) Craig Calcattera has a roundup of reaction to the play at HardballTalk. While Pirates Manager Clint Hurdle put it best by saying, “The game deserved better,” there is a silver lining in this for Pirates fans: when was the last time they had something to scream about this late in the season?  On Wednesday, Frank Coonelly, the Pirates’ president, said he filed a formal complaint with the commissioner’s office, The Associated Press reported.  In a statement, he said:  “The game of baseball and this game in particular, filled with superlative performances by players on both clubs, deserved much better. We have filed a formal complaint with the Commissioner.  “While we cannot begin to understand how umpire Jerry Meals did not see the tag made by Michael McKenry three feet in front of home plate, we do not question the integrity of Mr. Meals. Instead, we know that Mr. Meals’ intention was to get the call right. Jerry Meals has been umpiring Major League games for 14 years and has always done so with integrity and professionalism. He got this one wrong.”  The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
