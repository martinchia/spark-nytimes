Advertisement By ROBIN FINN Undefeated one game into the 1991-92 season but under pressure to add an explosive element to the unspectacular chemistry of his team, Islander General Manager Bill Torrey said he was "continuing to explore the possibility" of trading center Pat LaFontaine. Torrey last week informed the rest of the league that he was prepared to entertain offers for LaFontaine, who refuses to play for the franchise as long as John O. Pickett continues to own it. Torrey confirmed that he has been contacted by several teams since then. LaFontaine, in the option year of a contract that pays him $425,000 this season, reportedly refused a $6 million, four-year pact approved by Pickett. Yesterday, the player's agent, Don Meehan, said the star center was prepared to sit out the entire season if necessary.  May Play on Olympic Team Should the Islanders fail to trade him and should the club remain unsold, LaFontaine, a 1984 Olympian, may play for the 1992 United States Olympic hockey team and then test the free-agent market when his Islander contract expires. Buffalo, Boston, Hartford and St. Louis are among the clubs interested in LaFontaine's services, but no team, said Torrey, has come up with the right deal yet. The Islanders have been for sale since March, with LaFontaine's status a lingering complication. "With the team in the state that it's in, hopefully moving toward the final stages of a sale, you have to focus on asset values," Torrey said. "And any player who is sitting out is not an asset value to us. But at the moment, I'm not about to do such a drastic thing." We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
