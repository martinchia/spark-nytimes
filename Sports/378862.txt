Advertisement  JIMMY CONNORS, ousted by WALLY MASUR in the second round of the Volvo/San Francisco tournament on Thursday night, says that at 39 he isn't ready to retire to the 35-and-over circuit yet. "I came here in good shape," he said, "and I'm leaving in good shape, although bordering on exhausted." He said he intended to play a full schedule this year: 14 tournaments plus the three remaining Grand Slam events.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
