ARLINGTON, Tex. â Friday was the first time the Detroit Tigers didnât bother to show up for the A.L.C.S. Manager Jim Leyland and Max Scherzer, Detroitâs Game 6 starter, offered their thoughts via conference call, but with only one ballclub present, the scene at the Ballpark here was akin to a debate with an empty chair, given the taut contests in this series that Texas leads, three games to two.

Leyland called it a chance for the wounded Tigers to heal for Saturday nightâs game. (Amazingly, no rain is in the forecast.) Topping the list of injured body parts he would like to heal would be the oblique muscles belonging to Delmon Young and Victor Martinez. âUnless they trip on the plane or something,â Leyland said he assumed all his players would be all right. âI havenât gotten any negative feedback from our trainers,â he added. âI assume all systems are a go.â Most of the Rangers took the field for an optional workout, but they are a banged-up bunch, too. Josh Hamilton, who has been bothered by a groin-muscle injury, was among the Rangers not participating, and Manager Ron Washington was in no mood to reveal how badly his center fielder was hurt. âHamilton had some discomfort,â Washington said. âItâs an issue that we have to deal with. But he will show up and he will be in the lineup and he will play. We are all dealing with some nagging injuries, but we can play through it.â Third baseman Adrian Beltre, his knee having been battered by foul balls this series, took Friday off, too. âWe called a workout,â Washington said. âIt was optional. And they chose the option not to come.â That sounded taut.
