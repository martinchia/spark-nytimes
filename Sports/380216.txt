Advertisement  D. J. Dozier, a former all-America running back for Penn State, reported to the Mets' Instructional League camp in Florida yesterday to continue his new baseball career although he is still under contract to the Minnesota Vikings. The Mets said that Dozier, who has not played for Minnesota this season after gaining 207 yards last season, would stay until Nov. 1, putting the finishing touches on a summer of baseball spent playing left field in their minor-league system. He resumed baseball this season after a seven-year lapse, hit .297 with 13 home runs for Port St. Lucie in the Florida State League, then hit .324 with Jackson of the Texas League.
