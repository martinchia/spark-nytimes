There is a delightful scent of autumn in the air. Not too hot, not too cold — you can feel that late October snap and the extra burst of brightness and color and energy that comes with it. In other words, it is the perfect time to bunker yourself indoors and watch a bunch of soccer on TV. Here are seven intriguing games featuring Americans playing in foreign leagues. (All times Eastern.) Saturday 10 a.m. Sometimes numbers speak for themselves. In this case, they shout: Five games, two goals, one win. Since Jurgen Klinsmann took over the United States team in July, the Yanksâ offense has been borderline incompetent. Jozy Altidore looks dangerous for his club team, AZ in the Netherlands, but cannot put it together for his country. Brek Shea seems on the verge of breaking out, but he botched a sitter against Honduras and has yet to tally for his new coach. Given this, might Robbie Findley be worth a look for next monthâs friendlies at France and at Slovenia? Check him out and decide for yourself when Nottingham Forest plays Blackpool (foxsoccer.tv). 12:30 p.m. If you are 100 percent convinced that Carlos Bocanegra and Oguchi Onyewu are the solution in central defense for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, then you need not bother watching Norwich City take on Liverpool (Fox Soccer, Fox Deportes). If some small part of you wonders if there might be a better option in front of Tim Howard, however, you might want to tune to see if Zak Whitbread has sufficiently healed from his early-season hamstring injury. The 6-foot-2, 27-year-old is an intriguing player who has endured a seemingly endless string of bad luck. Liverpool will pose a huge challenge. Can he handle the pressure? 6 p.m. Herculez Gomez will never be confused with Gonzalo HiguaÃ­n, but with five goals in 12 Mexican Primera Division games this season, Gomez is showing once again he has a goal-scorerâs touch. Gomez has to know that the U.S. attack is struggling, and some strong performances in the next few weeks could catapult him back onto the national team roster. The Estudiantes Tecos-Santos Laguna match (Galavision) becomes much more interesting when viewed through the lens of Gomezâs opportunity. 10 p.m. Should he stay or should he go? That is the dilemma Tijuana midfielder Joe Corona is currently confronting. Back in August ESPN.comâs Jeff Carlisle expertly framed the 21-year-old Mexican-Americanâs background and thinking. And then Corona was called into a Mexican under-22 team, which seemed to seal the deal for El Tri. Now, apparently, the Los Angeles native and San Diego County high school product is reconsidering his decision and would welcome a U.S. invite. Coronaâs current state of indecision –not to mention his impressive talent — makes Tijuanaâs match against Atlante (Telefutura) one worth watching. Sunday 8:30 a.m. No, we are not going to suggest that you choose the Fulham-Everton match (foxsoccer.tv) over the English Premier League game of the season (so far) — Manchester United versus Manchester City (Fox Soccer, Fox Deportes). But you definitely earn our respect if you fire up the laptop/iPad and keep tabs on Clint Dempsey and Tim Howard while the big boys do their derby thing. 9 a.m. Michael Bradley looked rock-solid last week for Chievo Verona against Juventus, taking corner kicks and holding his own against some technically gifted players. Can he replicate — or perhaps even improve upon — that effort this week against Internazionale (ESPN3.com; tape delay at 5 p.m. on Fox Soccer)? Given the lackluster options in the center of the U.S. midfield — at least until Stuart Holden recovers, that is — U.S. fans have got to hope that Bradley continues his return to form. 11:30 a.m. When we last saw Steve Cherundolo against Ecuador, he was getting spun around like a top by Real Betisâ speedy wing Jefferson Montero. Was that merely a particularly tricky matchup that made the 32-year-old right back look, well, old? Or are the years starting to catch up with the veteran right back? Dolo will get a great chance to redeem himself in Hannover 96’s match against Bayern Munich (GolTV), a terrific team on a terrifying run. What will you be watching this weekend?
