Dane Richards did score a goal on a header after all. The day after the Red Bulls defeated Philadelphia, 1-0, at Red Bull Arena in Harrison, N.J., Major League Soccer’s poobahs went to the videotape and let Union goalkeeper Faryd Mondragon off the hook. The goal comes at about the seven-minute mark in the video below:  It turned out to be the seventh goal of the season for the 5-foot-7 Richards. And after the game some of his teammates had a bit of fun with it. (On the play, Jan Gunnar Solli earned his seventh assist and Dax McCarty got his sixth assist of the season.) “An early goal for any team helps, but one off Dane’s head is ridiculous in its own right,” defender Tim Ream said. While the Red Bulls’ victory puts them in the playoffs as one of four wild-card teams, their final playoff position and first-round opponent is impossible to determine until the completion of this weekend’s games. And that includes Sunday’s late afternoon match between Houston and Los Angeles at the Home Depot Center. There are myriad possibilities, so why not just sit back and save some brainpower until it all plays out. The Red Bulls will be back on the practice field at Montclair State University on Sunday morning and are likely to open the playoffs on Wednesday. The only certainty: the match will be on the road and the club’s only chance to play one more home game this season will come with a win in the first round. U.S. Names Men’s Youth National Team Coaches Caleb Porter, 36, has been named the coach of the United States under-23 men’s national team that will attempt to qualify for next summer’s London Olympics in March. In addition to the Olympic team announcement late Thursday, the federation also picked Tab Ramos as the coach of the under-20 national team. (Also, the U.S. announced it would play an international friendly against Slovenia in Ljubljana on Nov. 15.) Porter, the coach of the defending N.C.A.A. Division I champion University of Akron, will continue as the Zips’ coach. He took over at Akron in 2006 and has a 90-13-10 record over five seasons. âWe are excited to have Caleb join our national team program,â Sunil Gulati, the president of U.S. Soccer, said in a statement. âStill early in his career, Caleb has been extremely successful and has demonstrated the ability to mentor and develop young players. A proven winner, we believe he will do a great job of leading our under-23 menâs national team as they look to qualify for the Olympic Games next summer.â During his tenure Akron has had 12  players drafted by M.L.S. clubs, including the 2009 No. 1 overall pick Steve Zakuani (Seattle), No. 4 pick Teal Bunbury (Kansas City) in 2010 and No. 2 pick Darlington Nagbe (Portland) in 2011. Ramos, 45, moved from Uruguay to New Jersey when he was 11 and was a star at North Carolina State. He played for the United States in the 1990, ’94 and ’98 World Cups. And is remembered most vividly for an incident in a second-round match against Brazil when he was elbowed in the face by Leonardo, who was expelled from the match.  Cities for 2014 World Cup FIFA has announced that the opening match of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil will be played at the ItaquerÃ£o Stadium in SÃ£o Paulo and the final at the MaracanÃ£ Stadium in Rio de Janeiro. The semifinal matches will be held in Belo Horizonte and SÃ£o Paulo, and the third-place match in BrasÃ­lia. In addition, FIFA’s executive committee, which was meeting in Zurich, said  the opening match for the 2013 Confederations Cup would be held in BrasÃ­lia, the final match in Rio, and the semifinals in Belo Horizonte and Fortaleza.
