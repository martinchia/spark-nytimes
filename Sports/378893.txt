From last seasonâs Super Bowl to the off-season lockout, from the whirlwind free-agency period to Tebowmania, this has been an N.F.L. year like any other, only more so. Here is a look back at the year that almost wasnât. JAN. 15 The Jets defeat the Patriots in what Rex Ryan probably convinced himself was the Super Bowl. JAN. 23 Maurice Jones-Drew, Darnell Dockett and other players attack Bears quarterback Jay Cutler on Twitter for missing the second half of the N.F.C. championship game with a less-than-devastating injury. Cutler also becomes the mayor of the Bearsâ sideline on Foursquare. FEB. 6 By winning the Super Bowl, the Packers rekindle the thrill of watching outstanding performers achieve excellence in the international spotlight that the Black Eyed Peas did everything possible to extinguish at halftime. MARCH 1 A judge rules that N.F.L. owners will not get $4 billion in television money if games are canceled by the lockout. The judge also explains to owners that money is usually acquired in exchange for providing goods or services, not shoveled into their bank accounts by magical pixies with diamond-tipped wands.  MARCH 11 The N.F.L. Players Association decertifies as a labor union and recertifies as a treehouse social club with a top-secret password of âgirls have cooties.â APRIL 28 Fans boo Commissioner Roger Goodell at the N.F.L. draft. A confused Goodell tries to explain that the Eagles are not on the clock for at least two hours. APRIL 29 The lockout is lifted for a matter of hours before an ownership-requested stay of a judgeâs ruling snaps it back into place. Several players who tried to go to work during the brief window of opportunity become trapped inside padlocked practice facilities. They are not found until late July, when they emerge wearing nothing but shoulder pads and speaking an unintelligible language based on labor rhetoric and playbook jargon. JUNE 3 After hearing arguments from both sides, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit says it will make its decision in âdue course,â which is legalese for âat the worst possible moment, when it has the greatest chance to derail productive negotiations.â EARLY SUMMER Tensions between the league and the players cool. Roger Goodell and DeMaurice Smith begin dining together, sitting together on flights, and writing each otherâs names in poufy letters all over their composition books. JULY 14 Both sides agree to a rookie wage scale because nothing unifies millionaires like the opportunity to deny someone else. JULY 18 Jerry Jones says that the labor deal is so close that the two sides are âdown to circumcising the mosquitoes.â The agreement is reported to be a 10-year deal that ends with what Jones calls a mosquito mitzvah. LATE JULY In anticipation of a resolution to the lockout, NFL Network switches to all-day coverage outside the negotiation headquarters on afternoons in which temperatures top 90 degrees. After several days, the reporter Albert Breer melts into a BlackBerry-scented puddle but reconstitutes and shouts âHappy Birthday!â when his fellow reporter Jason La Canfora places a silk hat on his head. JULY 21 Owners unilaterally vote to approve the framework of the labor agreement. Everyone cheers. Players take to Twitter to explain that there is no agreement and that the owners are trying to railroad the process. Everyone groans. Despite a six-hour national anxiety attack, everything returns to status quo the next morning. Instantaneous communication is a real frolic on the beach, isnât it? JULY 25 The lockout ends for real. Sports business analysts are allowed a shower, two beers and a phone call to loved ones before beginning their N.B.A. coverage. LATE JULY/EARLY AUGUST Front offices around the league try to cram five months of roster transactions into five days as fans, reporters and the Giants watch. JULY 30 The Colts sign Peyton Manning to a contract worth a reported $90 million over five years, which has worked out to infinity dollars per game played. AUG. 2 The Eagles sign their 10th high-profile free agent and get their card stamped so that the 11th one will be free. AUG. 4 Players vote to ratify the final language of the labor agreement. In the days between the end of the lockout and the final tallying of votes, newly acquired free agents were allowed to neither practice nor disappoint. SEPT. 8 In the season opener, the Packers and the Saints combine to score 45 points in the first half of what will be a 42-34 Green Bay victory. Itâs a touchdown apology, the football equivalent of seeking forgiveness for chewing up the newspaper by making sad puppy eyes. And it totally works. OCT. 8 Al Davis dies just days after Steve Jobs. Those were the last two Americans with vision, folks. The rest of us can now just hunker down and wait for our way of life to slowly disintegrate. OCT. 23 Tim Tebow starts his first game for the Broncos. Historians will call this date Tebowary 1. NOV. 1 Ndamukong Suh meets with Roger Goodell to discuss the leagueâs policies on unnecessary roughness. The meeting is so successful that it inspires Suh to discover an all new, even less necessary form of roughness. NOV. 29 Wayne Weaver announces the sale of the Jacksonville Jaguars to the Illinois automotive repair tycoon Shahid Khan, setting in motion the series of events that lead to another âStar Trekâ movie. DEC. 13-14 Coach firing season is in full swing, as Todd Haley of the Chiefs and Tony Sparano of the Dolphins join Jack Del Rio of the Jaguars on the unemployment line. Eric Mangini begins his campaign to return to the sideline by stealing Bill Cowherâs cellphone. DEC. 14 The N.F.L. announces a nine-year extension of its television contracts. To clarify, this does not mean that pregame shows will be nine years long. DEC. 18 Tim Tebowâs Broncos lose to the Patriots, stunning fans who were convinced Denver was never going to lose a game again, ever. DEC. 24 Giants versus Jets at MetLife Stadium on Christmas Eve afternoon. The 3-hour-35-minute game features 47 incomplete passes, 18 punts, 15 penalties, 12 three-and-out drives and 3 endless replay challenges that threaten to take the game straight into midnight Mass. Fox switches to the Yule log midway through the fourth quarter just to keep viewers interested. DEC. 31 Jason Garrett ices his own Champagne. Happy New Year! The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
