It seems ever clearer that Peyton Manning will not play for the Colts next season. So where will he play if he decides not to retire? Jason La Canfora said on the NFL Network on Tuesday that he had been working on the Manning story for months. In an article on NFL.com, he looked at the likeliest options: We’ve reported in the past that other general managers and executives identified Arizona and Seattle as places that Manning would be interested in. Both teams could obviously use an upgrade at the quarterback position, and both have rising young defenses, along with run games that made strides this season. The Cardinals have a game-breaking receiver in Larry Fitzgerald, and Sidney Rice can be a weapon in Seattle if he can just stay healthy. La Canfora is skeptical that the Redskins, the Dolphins or the Jets could land Manning. Regarding the Jets, âskepticalâ is an understatement. The Jets? Don’t get me started. With all the dysfunction in that locker room, Rex Ryan’s bluster, an overwhelming media glare and the constant hysteria of two Mannings in New York… No way I see Peyton walking into that cauldron. Not his scene. Extra point Where do you think Manning will wind up next season? Or do you think âRob Lowe will end up being right, after allâ? The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
