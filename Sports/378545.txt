Ball caps travel far and wide. They do far more than keep the sun out of your eyes or the cold off your head. Ball caps are a statement. My collection of ball caps is eclectic. Last year I was given caps with NYPD and FDNY by two separate officers on two successive days. I wear them proudly on the occasion. Today I am wearing a Hofstra lacrosse cap, not because I ever played that grand sport but because it was a gift from John Danowski, when he was coaching at my alma mater. The word from Libya is that a young man wearing a Yankee ball cap may have been one of those who shot Col. Muammar El-Qaddafi on Thursday. Another Yankee cap was seen on a young man in the celebratory crowd. I cannot say I am surprised. Yankee caps pop up all over the world, not as a statement of loyalty to that team, but as a symbol of, what? Winning 27 so-called World Series? Much of the world doesnât even play that sport.
 In 1996, a week after the Yankeesâ first championship since 1978, I saw a Yankee cap in the crowd waiting outside the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. A few days later I saw a couple in London. Some of the NYY caps Iâve seen in Europe were worn by young men of color. The rapper Jay-Z helped make them a popular urban accessory here by wearing one on album cover photos and on videos. In New York, they’ve also been worn by an alarming number of criminals.  The best result Iâve ever had from a ball cap came when I was wearing a World Cup 1990 cap while accompanying my wife on a child-care mission outside Hanoi in 1991. A young worker at an orphanage saw it and said, âMaradonaâ and we then held a 15-minute conversation â- in German. (He had worked in the East Berlin subways; I did not know I spoke any German, but turned out I did.) The cap was a year old, and grimy, but I gave it to him when we left. Just guessing, but a lot of you probably have ball-cap stories to tell. What encounters have you had because of your choice of head gear? And what incongruous spottings have you made?
