A late-game scoring burst enabled LeBron James to vanquish the Celtics and silence those detractors who had said he couldnât close. Now that he has finally beaten the Big 3 â Kevin Garnett, Ray Allen and Paul Pierce â in a playoff series, James will turn his attention to the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference finals. When he glances at the Chicago sideline, he will see an old nemesis, Coach Tom Thibodeau. As a Celtics assistant, Thibodeau designed defenses that ended Jamesâs seasons two of the past four years. When Chicago hired Thibodeau last summer, many speculated that it would help the Bulls land James. James usually discusses the link between defenses and championships, and Thibodeau is signed to Creative Artists Agency, with which James is also affiliated. Instead, James is starring with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, and Thibodeau built his team around a budding superstar, Derrick Rose, and made the Bullsâ defense the top-rated one in the N.B.A. The primary defensive responsibilities of guarding James will fall to Luol Deng, an underrated but dependable small forward. âHeâs had a great year,â Thibodeau said. âHe stood up to everything that has been thrown at him. The small forward position in this league is a tough position to play because almost every night, defensively, youâre going up against somebody whoâs really, really good and can score and who is going to make you work at it.â That description fits James quite snugly. Against James and other elite wing players like Kobe Bryant, Thibodeau usually floods the strong side with defenders and makes the star earn his points. James had superb performances when Thibodeau was in Boston, including a 45-point game in Game 7 of the 2008 conference semifinals. But that came in a loss. When James was with Cleveland, the flooding option was a no-brainer. Against Miami, with James and Wade able to adapt over what many expect to be a long series, the defense could be stretched and picked apart. The Heat dropped all three games to Chicago in the regular season, by a combined 8 points. James missed one game with an ankle injury, but averaged 27.5 points and 9 rebounds in the other two. Miami averaged a pedestrian 90.3 points in those games, below their season average of 94.7 points.
