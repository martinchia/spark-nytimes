If a delicate balance exists in the chemistry that makes TNTâs âInside the NBAâ a successful and amusing studio program, will a huge new ingredient named Shaquille OâNeal alter it? The camaraderie that binds Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith and Ernie Johnson as a team is difficult to imitate â as ESPN has shown â so why try to change the chemical balance? The answer: because Shaq exists. OâNeal can be charming and funny, but whether he will equal Barkleyâs outrageousness is unknown. OâNeal is also surprisingly soft-spoken for a man of his dimensions. Barkleyâs voice matches his size. âWeâre going to make it very fun,â OâNeal said on a conference call Thursday. âWeâre going to make it more exciting for the fans to watch.â He said he religiously watched âInsideâ as a player, which probably gave TNT an edge over ESPNâs bid, as did the fact that he owns a house near  Atlanta, where TNT is based. OâNeal had one meeting with ESPN, where the network laid out its plans and salary for him. But Turner won. A week later, OâNeal called John Skipper, ESPNâs executive vice president of content, to say (according to Skipper), âI respect you guys too much to put you through a long process.â The deal with Turner to be a full-time analyst also includes a development deal with its entertainment and animation networks. With aspirations to work in law enforcement, OâNeal could turn up on TNTâs âSouthlandâ or âMemphis Beatâ series, or star in a cartoon series. But he will not revive his title character in the 1996 film âKazaamâ in a cartoon series. âKazaamâs back in the bottle,â he said. âNo Kazaam jokes.â Smith has already dubbed OâNeal the Big Analytical, which lacks the intellectual heft or grandeur of the Big Aristotle, the Big Cactus, Shaq Fu and Shaq Daddy. And with that sort of nickname, you might expect big and brilliant analyses. His first shot at analyzing month-old  news â the Dallas Mavericksâ defeat of the Miami Heat in the N.B.A. finals â was mediocre. The Heat âjust came up against a team, and it was their turn,â he said, adding that the Mavericksâ Dirk Nowitzki âplayed unbelievably.â His assessment of the current state of the center in the N.B.A. â without himself and the newly retired Yao Ming â was more insightful. âThe beasts are now gone,â he said. âThe Goliaths are now gone. That leaves Dwight Howard out there by himself. If he doesnât get two or three championships, Iâm disappointed because he has no competition out there anymore. None. Zero.â
