It doesn’t seem as if Vince Lombardi has left. There’s the play. There’s the newÂ HBO documentary, which will be shownÂ Saturday at 8 p.m. Eastern and Pacific. There are the Miami Dolphins, who arrived in the  New York area early this week to watch the Broadway show before facing the Jets. The Dolphins’ owner, Stephen Ross, wanted it to be an inspirational event for his team. Jeff Darlington, The Miami Herald: It was a nice night — one that Ross began planning for more than a month ago in the city where he is respected as a real estate mogul. “Most of these guys never heard of Vince Lombardi,” said Ross, who was inspired by the play when he saw it a few months back. “They weren’t alive when he died, and they’re all playing for the Lombardi Trophy. It’s part of the NFL.” It was hard to hide an N.F.L. team in Midtown Manhattan.  According to the article, one Jets fan said, “Get their playbook!”
 Here is The Times review of the HBO documentary, from Ginia Bellafante. Among the interviews in the film are an emotional reflection by Frank Gifford, who played for Lombardi when he was an offensive coach for the New York Giants, and talks with his two children, Susan and Vince Jr., who speak candidly about the consequences of Lombardiâs domestic rigidity. Not everything that works on the gridiron works in life. The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season. You can also find links to coverage from around the league, tips for your fantasy football team and discussion with other football fans.
