From The Montreal Gazette’s Habs Inside/Out blog, this post discusses two newspaper surveys on whether fans and corporations would pay higher costs for N.H.L. hockey and the plight of the Ottawa Senators.  Two of the concerns regarding the N.H.L returning to Winnipeg center on whether fans are willing to pay high ticket prices and if there is enough corporate support to make the team successful. A pair of stories in The Winnipeg Sun suggest both could be non-issues. Peter Friesen reports today that the paper contacted about one-third of the luxury suite holders at MTS Centre, and “17 of the 25 executives we reached said they would renew their suites at our predicted NHL price, which is triple the current rate. “Three more said theyâd reduce their portion of their suites but stay involved, while three said they werenât sure. Just two of the 25 said the high price tag would force them out of the game.” Friesen says the yearly cost of leasing a suite is expected to rise from an average of around $60,000 to $180,000.

In another story, Friesen reported that in an online survey by the paper, 72 percent of the 410 respondents who answered the question said they are willing to pay at least $50 to see a single game, with most saying theyâd spend between $50 and $100. The average price for a ticket in Edmonton is $50 and Friesen says the average projected price in Winnipeg would be between $50 and $60. However, Rexall Place in Edmonton seats 16,839. The MTS Centre seats 15,015. The fate of the Phoenix Coyotes is expected to include a return to Winnipeg if the complicated business arrangements to keep the team in Arizona, don’t work out favorably for the City of Glendale. The Winnipeg Free Press has a special online section that regularly tracks developments with the City, the NHL and the Coyotes. Read the entire post at Habs Inside/Out.
