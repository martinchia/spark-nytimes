SAN DIEGO — Tiger Woods was asked in December why he was bypassing this weekâs PGA Tour stop at Torrey Pines despite having won here 6 times in 12 appearances. It is also the site of his last major victory, the 2008 United States Open. Woods instead committed to play in a concurrent European Tour event in Abu Dhabi with less than half the total purse — $2.7 million to $6 million here.  At the time, he explained the decision as if he was crossing off an item on his travel bucket list.  âWhy not?â Woods said. âI had never been to Abu Dhabi, and this is the first time, so decided to mix it up a little bit.â  But everybody in the room knew Woods, like other top golfers, was following the money. Unlike the PGA Tour, the European circuit allows tournaments to use appearance fees to lure golfers to its events. Woods reportedly is receiving $1.5 million to play in Abu Dhabi, $500,000 more than heâd pocket for winning for the seventh time at Torrey Pines.  When Tim Finchem, the PGA Tour commissioner, asked all the players â foremost Woods â to add new events to their schedules, he probably wasnât talking about the Abu Dhabi Championship.   On Tuesday, Woods came clean. When pressed, he acknowledged that his schedule revolves as much around appearance fees as it does anything, including his parenting time with his two children.  âIâd have to say yes, it certainly does,â Woods said in an article on the BBC Web site. He added, âThatâs one of the reasons why a lot of the guys who play in Europe do play in Europe. The only place we donât get it is the U.S.â   Tournament officials on the PGA Tour are left to bait the big fish with free spa treatments and creamy milkshakes, free luxury rental cars and personal concierges. The organizers got the fields they paid for this week: Led by No. 1 Luke Donald, the top four players in the world and 11 of the top 25 are playing in Abu Dhabi. The top-ranked player in the Farmers Insurance Open is No. 9 Dustin Johnson, and heâs coming off a week in which he was forced to withdraw mid-event because of the residual effects of off-season knee surgery.
