After scouring the globe in a long and often frustrating search, the Red Bulls on Thursday removed the interim tag and named the New York native Mike Petke as the team’s new head coach. Sixty-seven days after parting ways with Hans Backe, the Major League Soccer club made Petke, 36, the 14th coach in the teamâs 18-year history. He is the fourth-youngest coach in the league, after Ryan Nelsen (Toronto), Ben Olsen (D.C. United) and Jay Heaps (New England). Although he has never held a head coaching job on any level, Petke said he is âmore than capable,â during a telephone conference call Thursday from the team’s preseason training base in Bradenton, Fla.  âIâve been around the team, I know the players,â Petke said. Asked about his relationship with the teamâs captain and star player, Thierry Henry, Petke said: âWe have a good relationship. Before he came here I didnât think anyone was as passionate about the game as I was. Whatever it is, Ping Pong, cards, whatever, he wants to win. I put him in the same category as guys like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant in that respect. Nothing has changed. No one will be coddled. They are human beings and men and I will treat them like men.â  The team had first been interested in Gary McAllister then Paulo Sousa and most recently Paul Lambert, according to reports, while also conducting interviews with the former United States internationals Claudio Reyna, Eric Wynalda and Tony Meola. But with the start of the 2013 M.L.S.season a little more than a month away, the Red Bulls decided to end the charade and give Petke his first full-time job as a head coach. The club did not announce the terms of Petke’s deal or the length of his contract, nor did it name any assistants. “Mike has been in on selection process since the first few week,” Andy Roxburgh, the club’s sporting director, said. “I worked with him when the players were training [in December] and was really impressed. He’s charismatic, well organized and has the respect of the players. And what’s very important is that he’s very experienced in terms of M.L.S. If we had brought in a coach in from Europe, he would have been experienced in Europe, but not in M.L.S. It’s an enormous advantage, he knows everyone and knows the league. He’s absolutely passionate about the club. Mike is an appropriate choice for us. It’s going to be an interesting adventure for us all.” Though Roxburgh said that the team’s European brain trust, led by the founder of Red Bull Dietrich Mateschitz and the team’s head of global soccer Gerard Houllier, were fully behind the decision to hire Petke, it has been a poorly kept secret that their opinion of American soccer and the coaching talent pool was less than thrilling. In the past three years, under General Manager Erik Soler and Backe, both Scandinavians, the club recruited middling players predominantly from northern Europe. Now, with Roxburgh in charge, that focus seems to have shifted. In the off-season, the Red Bulls signed Juninho (Brazil), Fabian Espindola (Argentina) and Jamison Olave (Colombia). And there has been a recognition that the Red Bulls need to do a better job developing and promoting American players. “One of the things felt when came here is that we canât be a satellite club for Europe,” Roxburgh said.. “We’re based in New York and New Jersey and the club needs to have its own roots.The aim is to make sure the heart and soul is American-based people who know the sport here, who know the league. It’s another element to this jigsaw puzzle.” Petke last year completed his second season as a Red Bulls assistant coach. He had a 13-year career in the league that included two stints with the club from 1998-2002 and 2008-10. Petke holds the current club record for games played, with 169 (196 in all competitions), games started (158 regular season) and minutes played (14,060 regular season). He was drafted by the MetroStars in 1998, No. 8 over all. He was traded to D.C. United before the 2003 season and won his only M.L.S. Cup title in 2004 with that club. He was then traded to Colorado during their 2005 season, helping the Rapids to reach the Western Conference finals.  The Red Bulls signed Petke again at the end of 2008 and he played 35 more matches for the team until retiring after the 2010 season Asked if, on the sideline, he would be a track-suit or a sports-jacket wearing coach, Petke said, laughing: “First and foremost, I’m going to have to ask my wife. She dresses me.” He hopes to be dressing for success. Follow Jack Bell on Twitter.
