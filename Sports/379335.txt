Major League Soccer will play its 2011 all-star game, against an opponent to be determined, at Red Bull Arena in Harrison, N.J., on July 27. It will be the third time the league has played its midsummer match in New Jersey. The league’s first two all-star games, in 1996 and 1997, were played in Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, which was demolished last year after a new stadium was built for the Giants and the Jets of the N.F.L. (Strange because the first major event in the stadium was a soccer match.) Although the league did not announce an opponent for the league’s stars, it did say that M.L.S. again plans to play a high-profile international club. Last year, Houston’s Reliant Stadium was sold out when England’s Manchester United played against the best from M.L.S. But with a capacity of nearly 26,000 at Red Bull Arena, it is more likely the league will end up playing a second tier team from Europe, or perhaps a club from South America because it simply could not recoup the cost of a top team in a stadium with a limited seating capacity. M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber recently spent time in Argentina, meeting with officials from Boca Juniors and other clubs. A possibility? Who knows. âThe combination of one of the most spectacular stadiums of its size in the world with the passionate soccer supporters in the metropolitan New York area will provide a terrific showcase for our All-Star Game,â Garber said in a statement. âRed Bull Arena will be a tremendous venue for this marquee event and we are pleased to bring the All-Star Game to an area with a rich soccer tradition.â  Since 2003, the M.L.S. all-stars have faced primarily opponents from Britain: Manchester United, Everton, West Ham United, Glasgow Celtic, Chelsea, Fulham, and Chivas Guadalajara of Mexico in 2003. Perhaps this is the year the league taps a club from Germany, or maybe Brazil (do you think the name Ronaldinho would draw a few folks to RBA?). Who would you like to see the M.L.S. stars play against? Or, would using the pickup game format used last year by Women’s Professional Soccer or more recently by the N.H.L. be interesting?
