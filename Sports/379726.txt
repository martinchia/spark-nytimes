A lawyer for Mets closer Francisco Rodriguez and the Queens district attorneyâs office are negotiating a plea agreement that could spare Rodriguez prison time, both sides said Thursday after a court hearing. The plea agreement must include an anger-management program that would be more stringent than the one Rodriguez had already agreed to as the result  of his suspension by the Mets in August, prosecutors said. That program was arranged through an agreement between Major League Baseball and the players union. The prosecutors said that the program they want could take up to a year and that Rodriguez would have to prove he had learned to control his temper.  Rodriguez, 28, is scheduled to appear in court Nov. 10, and the prosecutors and his lawyer hope to have an agreement by then. âOne of my concerns is to make sure the children are taken care of and they get the support they need,â District Attorney Richard A. Brown said when asked about a possible plea agreement. He was referring to the two children Rodriguez has with his estranged girlfriend, Daian Pena. When asked about a possible prison sentence as part of a plea deal, Brown said, âI donât know.â Rodriguez was arrested on Aug. 11 after an altercation with Penaâs father outside the family lounge at Citi Field after a Mets loss. The Mets, after learning that he had torn a ligament in the thumb of his pitching hand during the altercation, converted his contract to a nonguaranteed one and withheld his pay for the rest of the season. The players union is contesting those actions. In previous court hearings, prosecutors have argued that Rodriguez has a dangerous temper, citing a 2005 Venezuelan order of protection in a domestic violence incident that hospitalized Pena. Scott Kessler, an assistant district attorney, has also singled out text messages that Rodriguez sent to Pena since his arrest, in violation of an order of protection. As a result of those messages, additional charges were filed against Rodriguez. After a quick court appearance that consolidated the assault and contempt charges, Judge Robert Raciti reminded Rodriguez, âThe order of protection is still in effect and thatâs until March.â Rodriguez said nothing to the judge or to the reporters waiting outside.
