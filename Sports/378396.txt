Rafael Nadal has continued his remarkable year on hardcourts with an emphatic second title at the United States Open, completing his run with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 win over top-seeded Novak Djokovic. Nadal, who improved his record on hardcourts this year to 22-0 with his victory, ultimately ran away with the match after breaking Djokovic at 4-4 in the third set, winning eight of the last nine games.  The title is Nadal’s 13th Grand Slam victory overall, putting him just four behind Roger Federer’s 17.  To see how it happened, continue reading below, and share your thoughts in the comments. 


8:46 P.M.Trophy Ceremony


“Obviously I want to congratulate Rafa and his team,” Djokovic said as he received his runner-up plate. :He was too good, and he definitely deserved to win this match and this trophy.”
Nadal, who missed last year’s United States Open and seven months of play overall citing knee pain, focused on the emotional side of the win. 
“Very, very emotional,” he said. “Only my team knows how much the match of today means.”
Like Serena Williams yesterday, Nadal wins a record total of $3.6 million in prize money for winning the tournament, because he also won the U.S. Open Series. 
The two posed with their trophies briefly, and then Nadal posed alone, biting the handle of the trophy in signature style.

Ben Solomon for The New York Times Nadal fell to the court after winning in 3 hours and 21 minutes.
Rafael Nadal needed only one chance to close out his second title in Flushing Meadows, claiming victory on his first championship point when a slappy Djokovic forehand hit the net. Nadal leapt in the air in joy and then fell onto his back, eventually rolling over onto his stomach in celebration before jogging to the net to shake Djokovic’s hand.
“You deserve it,” Djokovic said as the two embraced.
Nadal then collapsed to his stomach again, and ran to his box to greet his family, friends, and staff.

Nadal has established a seemingly insurmountable lead in this fourth set, and will now serve for the title up 5-1 in the fourth set. Djokovic appeared en route to keeping himself within touching distance in the fourth, but after going up 30-0 at 1-4 he sprayed four consecutive unforced errors to give Nadal the break.
Nadal will now try to serve for the title up 5-1; if he fails, he would get another chance at 5-3.




8:26 P.M.Nadal Two Games From Victory

Shortly after the match crossed the three-hour mark, Djokovic got himself on the board in the fourth set, holding for 1-3 in the fourth. 
Nadal responded in kind, delivering a routine hold of his own to put himself up 4-1, just two games from the title.
Djokovic has hit far more unforced errors of the two, hitting 49 unforced errors to just 20 for Nadal. But one surprising category in which he trails significantly is grunting. While normally matches between the two produce a sort of call-and-response of guttural utterances, Djokovic has rarely made a peep, leaving Nadal’s vocals as a solo track.

Nadal then held for 3-0, this time knocking a backhand winner into the open court to seal the game, his fifth straight.  Rafael Nadal is one set from his second United States Open title, taking the third set of the final 6-4 over Novak Djokovi Djokovic missed an easy short forehand into the net to give Nadal the set point opportunity, and Djokovic converted by drawing a forehand error from Djokovic on the 18th shot of the following rally. As the ball sailed long, Nadal celebrated by crouching to the ground and pumping his fist in lawn mower-esque fashion. Nadal internal dialogue: Vamos. Vamos. Vamos. Vamos. Vamos. Vamos. Vamos.
Djoko internal dialogue: !@#%&@!#@#%
#usopen â Christopher Clarey (@christophclarey) 9 Sep 13 After holding to level the third at 4-4, Djokovic scored an early knockdown in the next game, as Nadal slipped on the baseline and awkwardly stumbled backward, giving Djokovic triple break point.  But Nadal would save all three, including the third on his first ace of the match, and eventually held with a cathartic  overhead smash that he sent into the stands. Djokovic will now serve to stay in the third set, down 4-5.  Biggest surprise about that rare Nadal fall is that he still did not manage to get the strings on the ball #usopen â Christopher Clarey (@christophclarey) 9 Sep 13 After trailing 1-3 Nadal leveled the third set at 3-3, benefiting from two unforced errors by Djokovic (the second a wild backhand miss).  Djokovic, who seemed to have all the momentum in the match having won five of six games, has lost two straight, and has again begun to mutter at his box in Serbian.  Nadal then dropped just one point en route to holding for a 4-3 lead in the third, benefiting from a continued spate of Djokovic errors. A few statistical updates as this match reaches what may be its midway point:  Djokovic has had a fairly easy time getting back the Nadal serve, making an impressive 84 percent of his returns. He also has five aces to zero by Nadal. Djokovic has won the majority of rallies that last zero to four shots, but Nadal has had a slight advantage once a rally reaches its fifth shot. Both men have an even winner-to-unforced error ratio, but Djokovic has twice as many in each category (32) as Nadal (16). Both men are also 3-for-6 on break points. Djokovic consolidated his early break with a hold in the second game of the set, finishing with his fifth ace of the match to go up 2-0. He then threatened to go up a double break after smacking a forehand return winner, but Nadal escaped the break point after Djokovic hit a backhand unforced error on the 13th shot of the rally.  Nadal would earn game point with a drop shot, and converted it on another Djokovic backhand error to hold for 1-2.  The two then exchanged routine holds in the next game, with Djokovic staying in front by one break, 3-2.  Picking up where he left off in the second set, Djokovic emphatically broke Nadal at love to open the third set, hitting a forehand return winner on the second point and forcing Nadal errors on the other three. The lead is the first for Djokovic since 1-0 in the first set.  Djokovic earned his second break of the match in the longest game of the match thus far, taking a 5-3 lead in the second set after five deuces. Djokovic finished with a 28-shot rally, far shorter than the 54-shot rally he needed to break the first time, but still the second-longest point of the match. Djokovic then held in the next game to seal the set, smacking a powerful backhand down-the-line that landed on the outside of the line to claim the set and level the match. Nadal will now serve to open the third set, with the final essentially having been reduced to a best-of-three. Djokovic’s break advantage lasted mere minutes, as Nadal quickly gained control in the next game by racing out to a 0-40 lead on the Serb’s serve.  Djokovic saved the first two break points but not the third, and so Nadal will now serve at 3-4, the second set having been brought back on serve. Nadal breaks back and am not sure a chair is going to do it for Djokovic on this changeover. Think he needs a couch
#usopen â Christopher Clarey (@christophclarey) 9 Sep 13 Djokovic earned his third break point opportunity of the match in the sixth game of the second set, and Rafael Nadal was not going to let it go easily.  After previously hitting a near-perfect lob winner and a backhand volley winner to set up the break point, Djokovic needed a 54-shot rally to win break point, running side-to-side before eventually forcing a backhand error from Nadal into the net to claim a 4-2 lead.  Djokovic raised his arms in well-earned exultation after the point was won, a gesture which also gave him ample time to catch his breath.  The conclusion in the press box is that the last point of that game was animated. We are waiting for live play to resume #usopen â Christopher Clarey (@christophclarey) 9 Sep 13 What’s the big deal? I play 54 shot rallies all the time :) â John Isner (@JohnIsner) 9 Sep 13 Nadal first held to level the second set at 2-2, a game highlighted by a wicked backhand winner that abruptly ended a 23-shot rally.  Djokovic then followed suit with a routine hold of his own, dropping just one point and finishing with his third ace of the match, a 98 m.p.h. serve past Nadal’s backhand which relied on precision rather than power. Nadal, who has only been broken once in the entire tournament, has held serve without the benefit of many aces, averaging just three per match. He has yet to hit one so far in this final.  After dropping the first set in disappointingly lopsided fashion, Djokovic delivered a convincing start to the second, holding with a 19-shot rally and then taking a 15-40 lead on Nadal’s serve. Nadal would save break points, the first he had faced in the match, finishing with an especially crushing backhand passing shot on the second.  Nadal then held on his second game point, and Djokovic followed with an easy hold of his own to increase his lead to 2-1 on serve, already showing himself to have gained a sturdier foothold in this second set than he had at any point in the first. Rafael Nadal closed out the first set 6-2 in just 42 minutes, a far faster pace than these two are normally accustomed.  The telling statistic from the first set was likely unforced errors:  Nadal only had 4, while Djokovic had 14.  Djokovic, who has yet to earn a break point on Nadal’s serve, will begin the second set serving.  After Djokovic efficiently hold to pull within 2-3, Nadal sat down on the changeover. After he stood up, he won the next eight straight points, holding at love and then breaking Djokovic at love to build his first set lead to 5-2.  Nadal needed a challenge on the last point to complete the sweep, but was proven correct as Hawk-Eye showed Djokovic’s forehand to have landed just long. Nadal will now serve for the first set, with an insurance break in hand if he needs it.  Nadal up two breaks on Djokovic who will now need a time machine to 2011 to win this set #usopen â Christopher Clarey (@christophclarey) 9 Sep 13 Djokovic made early headway toward breaking Nadal right back, going up 0-30 on the Spaniard’s serve. But three unforced errors off Djokovic’s forehand swung the game back to Nadal, and after winning the longest rally of the match thus far (27 shots), he would hold for a 3-1 lead. Djokovic then responded with the most routine service hold of the match so far, dropping just one point en route to holding his own serve to narrow Nadal’s lead to 3-2. What Djokovic knows but obviously can’t help is that every display of negative energy he makes is like extra oxygen for Nadal #usopen â Christopher Clarey (@christophclarey) 9 Sep 13 After Djokovic held to open the match Nadal did as well,initially taking a 40-15 lead with a 17-shot rally. He slipped to deuce, but closed out the game with two strong first serves. Nadal then immediately put Djokovic under pressure in the next game, earning the first break point of the match by forcing a backhand error. Djokovic would save that one, but Nadal would earn a second shortly after, finishing a 12-shot rally with an inside-out forehand winner, a clenched fist, and a 2-1 lead. First break to Nadal and Djokovic would surely be in favor of banning the Nadal forehand #usopen â Christopher Clarey (@christophclarey) 9 Sep 13 Making all six of his first serves, Djokovic held to open the first set.  As if to warn viewers to get comfortable, Djokovic and Nadal wasted little time in introducing elongated rallies, going for 17 shots on the third point and 14 shots on the fourth. In something of a surprise, the players walked on court one minute earlier than planned, at 4:59 p.m. In their pre-match interviews, Nadal said he was going to “try my best,” and Djokovic said that he had to “expect a difficult match.” The coin toss, which was officiated by Australian great Rod Laver, initially landed in the net. The second attempt came up heads and was won by Djokovic, who elected to serve first.   General feeling is that there is such a thing as Djokovic-Nadal time. One set equals one hour. We’ll see #usopen â Christopher Clarey (@christophclarey) 9 Sep 13 The rivals Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have played 36 times over all, with Nadal winning 21. Nadal is only 27 and Djokovic is 26, but those 37 meetings are already a record on the men’s side during the Open era for the most between any two players. The last time they played for a Grand Slam title on a hard court, at the 2012 Australian Open, the match lasted almost six hours, so buckle up. It could be a long ride.  Nadal has been an unstoppable force on hard courts this year, unbeaten in 21 matches on the surface. He won titles in Montreal and Cincinnati in the lead-up to the Open,  and he has dropped only one set in this tournament.  In particular, Nadal has served exceptionally well. He has faced only 12 break points in 19 sets at the Open and has been broken only once. Djokovic may be the best returner in the game, and he was generated 86 break points in his 21 sets in New York, converting 44 percent of them. But he was 4 for 19 on break-point chances in his semifinal against Stanislas Wawrinka on Saturday. He’ll be lucky if he gets that many opportunities on Nadal’s serve.  Nadal is the fresher player. His semifinal against Richard Gasquet was over in straight sets and 2 hours 21 minutes, while Djokovic needed five sets and more than four hours to put away Wawrinka. Djokovic also started slowly, seeming out of sorts until the middle of the second set. If that happens again, Nadal may pounce.  — NAILA-JEAN MEYERS Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court.
