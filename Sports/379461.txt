WASHINGTON â It was a classic case of under-promise and over-deliver, but the Nationals did not plan it this way. Ideally, this would have been Stephen Strasburgâs 29th start of the season, and the weather would have been gorgeous on Tuesday at Nationals Park. But it was Strasburgâs first start, a year and three days removed from Tommy John surgery, and it rained all day. 	So at 4 p.m., Manager Davey Johnson talked about the dreary weather forecast and the cautious pitching forecast. There seemed to be no window in which the Nationals and the Dodgers could play. And even if they did, Johnson said, Strasburg would probably not work many innings. 	âI was thinking four would be great, especially with all the rain in the area,â Johnson said afterward. âShoot, he just made it look easy.â 	The Nationals lost, 7-3. The elements and the calendar — the first day of school for lots of kids — kept many people from buying tickets, and many ticket holders from coming. Just 29,092 people paid for tickets, fewer than two of the crowds last weekend against the Mets. 	But those who were here could say they saw the beginning of the next phase of Strasburgâs ascendant career. He breezed through five crisp innings in just 56 pitches (40 strikes) and showed off his tantalizing tricks: the 99-mile-an-hour fastball, the wipeout changeup, the killer curveball. He struck out four, allowing two hits and no runs or walks, without seeming very impressed. 	âItâs good,â Strasburg said of his stuff. âItâs not where it was just yet. Iâve come to realize I donât need to throw 100 every time to try to get guys out.â  	Strasburg said he has not changed his mechanics, but he worked out vigorously during his rehabilitation, because throwing was strictly limited. He is stronger, he believes — âupper and lower body, core, you name it,â he said — and better able to handle a major league workload. 	âItâs not like I was waiting 368 days for this time, you know?â Strasburg said. âIâm still on a mission here. I wanted to get stronger, mentally and physically, through this process. I had something new I wanted to work on every single day here. I didnât waste a minute waiting for this day to come, because I knew it was going to come sooner or later.â 	Johnson praised every aspect of Strasburgâs performance â his efficiency, the fluidity of his delivery, the location of his fastball, the preposterous notion of his 90-mile-an-hour changeup. Even in losing, it was a very good day for the Nationals. 	âHe was special,â Johnson said. âIt was nice seeing him back.â The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
