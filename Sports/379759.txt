Zach Hillesland, a former forward for Notre Dame who contributes to the Quad, provided analysis as the field was selected for the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament. 5:34 p.m. | Updated With less than 30 minutes to go before Selection Sunday, teams all over the country are gathering in locker rooms, arenas and coaches’ homes awaiting their N.C.A.A. tournament fates. For some teams, that will mean watching the N.C.A.A. selection show on C.B.S. and not hearing your teamâs name called.  In the event that that unfortunate scenario takes place, youâll then have to switch over to ESPNU -â if your digital cable package allows it — and be forced to watch the Not In Tournament Selection Show (otherwise known as the notorious N.I.T.). With the expansion of the tournament to 68 teams, the reality slap that is the bubble bursting shouldnât quite sting as much as it used to, but that doesnât mean that teams, coaches and taking heads all over the country wonât debate and rationalize till they fall asleep midsentence. “The Social Network” getting snubbed in the Oscars this year serves as a terrible omen for Harvard getting an at-large bid.  If the director David Fincher, the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and the Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg canât get the nod over a stuttering king, what makes you think that Harvard and Coach Tommy Amaker will be plucked from hopeful fringe? The good news for Harvard players is that none of them are seniors and should theoretically be able to bounce back and compete for a tournament bid next year should tonight not go their way. That is, unless, half the team leaves for Palo Alto to work on the next big Y Combinator project. Other interesting things to watch: How high will UConn climb after its amazing Big East tournament run? Will the Big East get two No. 1 seeds? Which 5-12 matchup is ripe for the picking? Weâre getting close.  They always announce the teams faster than you think, so sit down, tune in, and brace yourself for whatever is about to happen. 



7:14 P.M. Joe Duffy’s Vanderbilt
 Quad blogger Joe Duffy was thinking his Vandy would end up a 4 or 6 seed. He wanted a 6 (good for Vandy karma). They got the 5. Time to make new memories. In recent years, he has posted his computer-generated picks here://www2.isye.gatech.edu/people/faculty/Joel_Sokol/profspicks/ I really want to see Jimmer play St. John’s in round 2. Two teams missing key players. I think St. John’s has the advantage in this one. When picking teams, remember that R.P.I., while it’s important to the selection committee, omits a rather important statistic, margin of victory. Joel Sokol, an associate professor at Georgia Tech, explained why in 2008: “A close win and a close loss are really very similar; the difference between them could be a single shot dropping in or rimming out. Just ask Christian Laettner. On the other hand, the difference between a tight victory and a blowout is much bigger. Changing the outcome of a 20-point victory may require two 3-point shots, a couple of layups, four midrange jumpers and two free throws to bounce the other way.” Apparently he’s shooting “Goodfellas 2: We’re Still Good” after the show. It already seems like they were a month ago. Winning a conference tournament is really just an insurance policy for disappointment in the N.C.A.A. Â Well, except for the Big East. But still… What have you done for me lately today? C.B.S. panel high on Kansas. Can’t say I disagree with them. Surprised Chuck didn’t just say Allen Iverson. Let’s start a movement to get sports announcers out of suits and into sweats. I need my announcers ready to spring into action at any moment. Suits don’t allow that. If you’re in a big pool, the statistics say, go against the grain. Just ask Bradley P. Carlin, who won so the NCAA pool so much it was shut down. There are two opportunities for all Big East second round match-ups: #11 Marquette vs #3 Syracuse and #6 Cincinnati vs. #3 UConn. When tournament time comes, you like to root for your conference. Hard to do so when you face them so quickly. Embattled No. 9 Tennessee draws the formerly embattled No. 8 Michigan. And No. 2 Notre Dame draws No. 15 Akron. Let’s get ready to rumble!  There’s just no rationale for making Florida a #2 seed but Kentucky a #4 seed. Did committee not watch today’s game?Sun Mar 13 22:46:08  via webNate Silverfivethirtyeight  Pitt is going to be too big and too physical for everyone in their bracket. I think they have the best chance out of the Big East teams to win it all. Quite an achievement for those individual teams and the league as a whole. Â But did they beat each other up too much during the regular season? For everything R.P.I., Jerry Palm is your guy …collegerpi.com … and on Twitter..Â https://www.twitter.com/#!/jppalm. His latest tweet, for all you, er, non-USC fans: “USC got in. Someone much more deserving got left out.” You can follow Nate Silver on Twitter —Â https://www.twitter.com/fivethirtyeight — where he raises a warning flag for the Blue Devils — “Not a great draw for Duke”.  SUPER nice draw for Michigan State. Florida is a very weak #2, UCLA a very weak #7, BYU a highly vulnerable #3. Great draw.Sun Mar 13 22:37:53  via webNate Silverfivethirtyeight  I’m thinking of throwing down my entire life’s savings on this tournament. I have a 50-50 shot…right? Nate Silver, at his blogÂ fivethirtyeight.com, has an essay about the records of teams that are forced to travel during the tournament. It’s not pretty: “Teams travelling at least 1,000 miles to play their game are 121-174, having won just 41 percent of the time.” It’s good news for Texas, which had a late-season fade and which plays the first round at Tulsa. But it’s bad news for Washington, which heads to Charlotte. Looks like Louisville has a pretty good shot for the Sweet 16. This selection show has more plugs than George Castanza’s head should have. The commercials aren’t enough to force me to buy things I don’t want? Please, stop. Is Charles not wearing a tie because he’s going Sunday casual, or do you think his clip-on broke? Regardless, he’s making my fantasy dinner foursome. This Selection Show is like the public school lottery documentary “Waiting for Superman,” except as of now, I’m not crying.  Michigan WAY overseeded at #8. But committee didn’t do them any favors since they’ll face Duke in Charlotte.Sun Mar 13 22:19:47  via webNate Silverfivethirtyeight  Michigan-Duke seemed like a interesting second round match-up, but Michigan has to go through Tennessee first. These 8/9 games are really messing with my emotions. I think Greg has lego hair. It looks like you could just pop it all right off his head. Maquette vs. Xavier is going to be a gritty, gritty first round game. This is why the tournament is fabulous. Marquette is better than an eleven seed and Xavier knows it. If I’m Xavier, I’m not clapping right now. I’m heading directly to the gym and into the film room — because that’s what Coach Buzz Williams is doing. Another Ivy vs. Kentucky matchup. Can Princeton avenge Cornell’s loss last year? I grew up just forty-five minutes away from Jon and our high school teams would scrimmage during the summer. He was a gym-rat then and is a gym-rat now. Can’t believe he’s a senior all ready. Will Buford was a freshman in high school when I was a senior is Toledo’s City League. He was a stud then. Not surprising to see him as a huge piece of this Ohio St. team. I wonder how much their loss against Louisville hurt their number one chances. It’s hard for me to be impartial on this one. ND has 11 top 50 RPI wins. Hard to ignore that. The committee did. Kansas, Pittsburgh, and Duke other three number ones. Ohio St. overall number one seed. Shocking. Having Chuck Barkley and Kenny “the Jet” Smith was a tremendous idea for C.B.S. A couple weeks ago during N.B.A. All-Star Weekend, Chuck participated in an all-time starting five NBA fantasy draft. Â With his first pick, he selected Allen Iverson, which is the funniest thing I have ever heard in my life. If Barkley says something along the lines of Auburn deserving a number one seed, I’m going to smash my computer out of pure joy and go live in the mountains because it’s not going to get any better than that. After spending all week in New York City, there’s something about returning to the midwest that makes you eat and behave like a pregnant woman. Within five minutes of landing, I housed one and a half cuban sandwiches and feel like sleeping. Whichever teams get assigned to play in the midwest, they’ll have to deal with that very same diet phenomenon. I once went to a Cracker Barrel and asked the waitress about the vegetable of the day. She said macaroni and cheese. I didn’t argue. So if your team is heading to the midwest, be sure to send them some flash frozen veggies to keep their diets balanced. And if anyone has a quick guide for turning jeans into stretch pants, please let me know. Time is a factor. Which teams should be most worried right now? How about all of them. Bad match-ups, bad locations, bad play times… I could just be super paranoid, but I always feel like the committee is going to leave out a team that was going to be a one seed. I honestly wouldn’t blame them. Oops, Kansas, we forgot. Sorry. Obviously that won’t happen, but when I was on teams that were a “lock,” I still had the feeling that we weren’t going to hear our name called.
