PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. â Jason Isringhausen was given his first Mets uniform in a dozen years and a locker across from his familiar old one in the Metsâ facility Wednesday, a day after signing a minor league contract with the team. âItâs weird to be back in here,â he said. âItâs very weird.â Now 38, Isringhausen will be given a chance to pitch in the Metsâ first spring training game, against the Braves on Feb. 26, as he attempts to make it back to the big leagues for the first time since he had Tommy John surgery in June 2009. But when he does pitch, it will be wearing jersey No. 45, one digit higher than the only number he has ever worn in the big leagues. Isringhausen wore No. 44 with the Mets, Athletics, Cardinals and Rays. But on the Mets. Jason Bay has that number â¦ for now. Bay never wore No. 44 until he joined the Red Sox in 2008, and now with the Mets. So Isringhausen thinks there is room to negotiate. âLetâs see if I make the team first,â he said with a smile. âWeâll talk about it then.â The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
