Nineteen-year-old American hopeful Ryan Harrison fell in his opening match at the 2011 U.S. Open, losing to No. 27 seed Marin Cilic 6-2, 7-5, 7-6(6).  Harrison, who upset No. 15 seed Ivan Ljubicic in the first round of the 2010 tournament, was unable to repeat that success Monday on Louis Armstrong Stadium, falling in straight sets despite having opportunities to serve for both the second and third sets. Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
