 On Saturday, Joe Gyau was on the bench for Hoffenheim in its 3-1 loss to Borussia Dortmund, but did not play. One of Hoffenheim’s other American players, Fabian Johnson, scored his team’s only goal. As one of the top young American prospects in Europe, Joe Gyau has emerged from the Bundesliga winter break to be part of Hoffenheimâs push to qualify for European play. Gyau, 19, began taking the initial steps last summer when he was invited to train with Hoffenheimâs first team during its preseason. While Gyau did play in some friendlies for the club, he was not part of the teamâs plans for the first half of the season. During the fall he played extensively with Hoffenheimâs under-23 team but during the winter break he received a call that he would resume training with the first team in preparations for the start of the second half of the year. âI was called into the first team during the preseason last summer,â Gyau said of his progress. âI did well and the coaching staff kind of knew me from then on. They were tracking me with my games for the reserve team. Come the winter time, they called me and told me they wanted me to train with them. I came back and I showed well again.â  The hard work paid off in the week leading up to Hoffenheimâs first game after the break when Coach Holger Stanislawski posted the 18-man match day roster and Gyauâs name was included. Stanislawski had told Gyau earlier in the week that he was impressed with the young Americanâs training sessions recently. But when Gyau saw his name on the lineup, he was still surprised. âWhen I first found out that I made the 18-man roster it was right after training and they put the list up,â Gyau said. âSome of the team regulars were looking at it like it was no big deal for them. I looked at the list and saw my name there and I tried not to react too hard. But inside I was really excited. Going to the game with the packed stadium was just great.â In an interesting turn of events, Gyau should have made his debut in the game against Hannover. With the score tied, 0-0, in the 89th minute, Stanislawski went over to Gyau and told him that he was going to enter the game as the teamâs final substitution. Gyau sprinted over to the fourth official to report but unfortunately there was a problem getting Gyauâs number onto the display board. As soon as they fixed the problem, the final whistle had been blown. âI was standing there for two minutes but the guy with the monitor had a hard time getting my number up on the board,â Gyau said. âFinally once he got it up, my name came up on the big screen and then the ref blew the whistle. I wasnât too disappointed because it was still a great opportunity. Iâm still just looking forward to the next time.â Gyauâs next opportunity may come Saturday when Hoffenheim visits defending champions Borussia Dortmund. Gyau is going to travel with the team and could play. Gyau was nervous leading up to the match against Hannover and will likely be nervous again in Dortmund where 80,000 people are expected to attend. âItâs a feeling you canât really explain,â Gyau said of being with the first team. âYou have butterflies when youâre rolling up to the stadium. But then once you get on the field and youâre warming up with the ball, then you kind of calm down because this is the moment youâve been training for. Thereâs no need to be nervous. When I was getting ready to come on, I was just really excited to show what Americans can do in Germany.â Gyauâs promotion to the first team at Hoffenheim is significant in that it means he is now the third American on the Bundesliga club. He joins the German-born Americans Fabian Johnson and Danny Williams who both made their U.S. national team debuts in the fall under Coach Jurgen Klinsmann. It is a unique situation for a club in one of the top leagues in Europe to have three Americans on the roster at one time. The only top tier clubs in recent times to have that number of Americans are Fulham and Everton (who faced each other Friday in an F.A. Cup fourth round match). Gyau does indeed feel there is a camaraderie among the three and he looks up to the other two who have been established with the club since the start of the season. âThree Americans on one Bundesliga team is unlikely,â Gyau said. âThose two guys are really nice and they are very open to me. They know Iâm American and weâre always talking. Iâm always asking how they like playing with Klinsmann because I havenât had that chance yet. But theyâre always giving me advice.â Gyauâs goals for the rest of the season revolve around earning increased minutes for the club and eventually become a starting option. Known for being an extremely quick wing with the ability to take defenders on with the dribble, Gyau wants to help Hoffenheim with its goal of earning a spot in European competition next year. The club currently is in eighth place with 23 points and trails sixth place Bayer Leverkusen by six points for the final Europa League spot. Gyau joined Hoffenheim along with fellow American Charles Renken before the start of the 2010 season when he left the Vancouver Whitecaps academy. Hoffenheim has earned a great reputation in recent years for its ability to develop young players. Gyau was impressed with Hoffenheim ever since he first toured the facilities of the club. âIf you ever come here, itâs like a paradise for a soccer player,â Gyau said. âAt the training place weâre at, there are six full fields that are all heated with lights. Inside you have whirlpools, gyms, massage tables — everything you can use to become a better player. The coaching staff is great and they help each of the players individually. They have videographers for each team and they make clips for every single player. Itâs amazing.â Hoffenheim has clearly worked hard on Gyau the past 18 months to improve his overall game and begin transforming his raw talent into a player who can become explosive on one of the highest levels. He plays mostly on the right wing for Hoffenheim but is in a position where he can shift to left wing during the course of a game. For Gyau, the biggest areas of improvement have come in his tactical awareness and his ability to read the game. âMy discipline has improved a lot tactically-wise — knowing when to make a run and knowing when to anticipate the situation to stay back,â Gyau said. âAs you move to a higher level, the tactics get more complicated and strenuous because you have to see what the other team is doing. We have to adjust our tactics to theirs.â On the international arena, Gyau is widely considered to be one of the cornerstones of the U.S. U-23 team that will attempt to qualify and push for a medal in the 2012 Olympic Games in London.  Gyauâs rise at Hoffenheim puts into question whether or not he will take part in Olympic qualifying in March since clubs are not required to release players for the CONCACAF qualifying tournament. Despite that, Gyau wants to play for the United States in qualifying and one of his driving sources of motivation was last yearâs failure of the U-20 team to qualify for its World Cup. After an undefeated run in group play, the U.S. teamâs tournament came to an abrupt and unsuccessful end in a stunning 2-1 loss to host Guatemala. Gyau played hurt that day but the loss of the game is something that still has left a bitter taste in his mouth. For Gyau and his teammates, qualifying for the Olympics would go a long way toward healing those wounds. âI still talk with Sebastian Lletget about it sometimes,â Gyau revealed. âWhen we were at the [U23] camp last month, we were talking about how much it hurt when the ref blew that final whistle and it was over for us. But weâre coming back extra hard right now. When qualifying rolls around, weâre not going to let anything go. Weâre going to leave it all on the field.â It is also possible that if Gyau makes his Bundesliga debut, a call-up to the senior national team may not be far behind. Gyau is emotional about the thought of finally realizing his dream of making it to the national team. He even admits that a call-up to the U.S. team may mean more to him than making the senior team at Hoffenheim. It would also mean that he has followed in the footsteps of his father and mentor, Philip Gyau, as one of the rare father-son combinations that have played for the U.S. national team. âItâs great to follow in my fatherâs footsteps and play on the national team,â Gyau said. âHe has taught me everything I know – from juggling the ball to dribbling to passing.â Brian Sciaretta, a native of Bernardsville, N.J., and a graduate of Georgetown University, writes about U.S. national teams and youth national teams for the Web site yanks-abroad.com.
