The Kentucky Derby winner Animal Kingdom was made the 2-1  morning-line favorite to become the 12th horse to win both the Kentucky  Derby and the Belmont Stakes on Saturday in the 143rd running of the  Triple Crownâs oldest and longest leg. He will break from the No.  9 post, and his trainer, Graham Motion, expects jockey John Velazquez  to keep Animal Kingdom much closer to the front of the pack in the  mile-and-a-half race than he was in the Preakness Stakes. In that  race, Animal Kingdom dropped far back after not liking the dirt kicked  in his face, and Â had to work harder in the stretch drive, ending with a half-length defeat to Shackleford. âI  think Johnny and Animal Kingdom were surprised how much dirt came  back,â Motion said. âBoth have learned since then, and he wonât be out  of touch. I think heâs going to have to be close in a mile-and-a-half  race.â Shackleford, at 9-2, will start from the No. 12 post, the  farthest outside, leaving jockey Jesus Castanon little choice but to gun  his colt early to clear the field and establish position on the rail. âIt  doesnât really matter because he likes to run from the front anyway,â  his trainer, Dale Romans, said of Shackleford, who led in the Derby  before finishing fourth and in the Preakness hit the homestretch in  first place. âWeâre comfortable setting the pace. Heâs fast enough that  heâll be able to break and clear everyone anyway.â  Belmontâs oddsmaker, Eric Donovan, apparently believes the public will be betting that a fresh horse is going to disrupt the rubber match between Animal Kingdom and Shackleford: Nehro is the morning-lineâs second choice at 4-1. Nehro, a son of Mineshaft, finished second in the Derby, then skipped the Preakness. He has only one victory in six starts, with runner-up finishes in the Louisiana and the Arkansas Derbys. âWeâve got three seconds in the last three Derbys,â said Brad Weisbord, the racing manager for Nehroâs owner, Zayat Stables. âWe hope to shed the bridesmaidâs tag and get the win. Nehro is very versatile, so he really can be anywhere.â It will be just the 22nd time in the Triple Crown that the Derby and the Preakness winners will have met in the Belmont, and the first since Afleet Alex defeated Giacomo in 2005 to sweep the second and third legs of the Triple Crown. Motion and Romans each captured Triple Crown races for the first time this year and have good-naturedly stoked a rivalry between the colts. They clearly have had fun over the past five weeks. âThe biggest part of racing is the Triple Crown,â Romans said. âThe Belmont is a grueling test, and you have to have a great horse to do it. My colt has been training super, and I think heâs going to prove tough out there.â Animal Kingdom has a chance to complete the first Derby-Belmont sweep since Thunder Gulch did so in 1995. For the first time, the field includes the first seven finishers in the Kentucky Derby. Motion knows his colt needs to best 11 challengers to pass the Test of the Champion, as the Belmont is known. He also makes no secret of his desire to see Animal Kingdom and Shackleford neck and neck in the stretch drive. âItâs going to be a tactical race, no doubt about it,â he said. âI think these two horses coming down the stretch would be the ultimate. It would validate the other two races.â The Rail, with Joe Drape, The New York Times's horse racing reporter, and others from the racing community, gives readers a look at the race for the Triple Crown.
