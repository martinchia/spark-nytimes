Not all teams are created equal, nor are they created equally. Though franchises look to emulate successful models or mimic particular elements of other teamsâ strategies they find to be palatable, the construction of each and every roster in the N.B.A. is a unique process. So few team centerpieces fit into a convenient mold, which makes building around them a challenge specific to their strengths, weaknesses, and tendencies. So the effects of removing such a centerpiece -â whether due to injury, suspension, or some other misfortune -â differ greatly depending on the particulars of the teamâs construction. Take Kobe Bryant out of the lineup for a night, for example, and the Lakers may still be competent due to the empowerment of the triangle offense. Certain systems are more accommodating to personnel losses than others, and the players surrounding a  superstar differ in their ability to carry on during times of star-less turmoil. Typically, teams that fail without one of their top players suffer from a lack of diversification in a particular skill. When one player is required to dominate a certain dimension of the teamâs play, they become far more valuable than merely the extent of their abilities. Dwight Howard is Orlandoâs only competent rebounder/interior defender, Steve Nash is Phoenixâs only truly productive, playmaker, and as was made painfully apparent last night, Dirk Nowitzki is Dallasâ one true source of shot creation.

Nowitzki has enjoyed impeccable health during his N.B.A. career, but he sat out Tuesday nightâs game against the Raptors to rest a strained knee he suffered on Monday. The Dallas offense promptly imploded. Without Nowitzki, a mishmash of role players were left to fend for themselves. The discrepancy in talent between Dirk and his teammates is notable, but the Mavsâ embarrassing loss to a short-handed Raptors team was as attributable to skill set as it was to actual skill. No one on the Mavs can produce at Nowitzkiâs level, but they also canât even occupy the spaces he normally fills on the floor, create quality shots in a half-court setting, or run the two-man game as a legitimate threat.  Dallas has many useful players, but the dirty little secret of the Mavsâ offense is that almost all of their shot creation is reliant on Nowitzki. Dallas is 13.77 points per 100 possessions better than their opponents with Nowitzki on the floor, and a horrid 13.27 points per 100 possessions worse than their opponents when heâs on the bench. Thatâs the biggest on/off discrepancy in the entire league, and it obviously isnât because of Nowitzkiâs scoring alone.  Caron Butler and Jason Terry can do a little off the dribble, but when they canât benefit from the spacing Dirk provides, their efficiency drops. Jason Kidd is a complementary playmaker at this stage in his career. He doesnât run an offense like Chris Paul or Deron Williams, but feeds teammates who thrive off the attention that Nowitzki demands. Tyson Chandler and Shawn Marion can contribute points here and there, but most of their baskets come off assists from Kidd or Terry, neither of which is a first-rate creator without Nowitzki on the court. Someone needs to generate shots for the Mavs offense. Even when Nowitzki is balancing the floor from the weak side, he facilitates the shot-creation of others, and without him, the Mavs transform into a crew of isolation scorers and strangely fitting parts.  This is where Nowitzkiâs incredible impact becomes a bit of a curse. The teamâs offense is built to maximize his talents in such a particular way that if Nowitzki were to ever be sidelined by a serious injury, the offense would collapse in Cavalier-like fashion both due to the structure of the system and the personnel Donnie Nelson and Mark Cuban have assembled around Nowitzki. Other teams can find some level of success without their star, but Nowitzkiâs absence eradicates any hope for offensive efficiency in Dallas.
