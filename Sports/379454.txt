Advertisement By FRANK LITSKY Two weeks ago, Harry Carson said he had no plans to retire from pro football. Thursday night, on an HBO program titled ''Inside the N.F.L.,'' he said he would retire after this season. Yesterday, Carson explained the contradiction. He said he had decided before the season that this would be his last year in pro football. Carson is earning $550,000 this year as an inside linebacker and the Giants' defensive captain. He will be 35 years old in two weeks. This is his 13th season in the National Football League, and he has played in nine Pro Bowls, tying the record.

Everybody has to go through this in professional sports. I would rather go out on my terms than someone else's terms.'' Advertisement Carson said he has no plans for his career after football. ''I'm going to enjoy myself,'' he said. ''Some people have linked me with a television network, but no offers have been made. I'm exploring various avenues, and the way I have managed my career I am in no rush to get into anything. I don't have to do anything for a long time. I'm happy.''
