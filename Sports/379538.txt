PASADENA, Calif. â There was a moment, in the waning moments of the third quarter of what may have been his last game as an Oregon Duck, that perfectly encapsulated the spirit of LaMichael James.  After a game-changing interception by linebacker Kiko Alonso on the other side of the ball, James took his second carry of the drive for 15 yards to the Wisconsin 22-yard line. He was running with a purpose, perhaps still angry about Wisconsin fans starting âThe Waveâ while injured Oregon guard Carson York was motionless on the ground earlier in the quarter. After James was finally brought down, he jogged a few extra yards and pointed toward the Oregon corner of the stadium. The fans erupted as James returned to the huddle, invigorated by his gesture as Oregon began to mount its comeback.  It was just a moment, a flash of emotion in a game filled with far bigger and more important plays. But it was still significant, and served as a reminder of the connection between James and the fans as he prepares to make a final decision about throwing his name in the N.F.L. draft.  After a scintillating 25-carry, 159-yard outing in Oregonâs breakthrough 45-38 Rose Bowl victory over Wisconsin, James has little left to prove at the collegiate level. Yet in the gameâs aftermath, he remained noncommittal about his decision.  âI really donât know,â James told The Eugene Register-Guard. âThis is the happiest Iâve ever been in my life, and I canât put money in front of my happiness.â A bit deeper into the locker room, senior wide receiver Lavasier Tuinei held court one last time with a group of reporters. In what was guaranteed to be his last game, Tuinei also went out in style, finishing with a career-high eight catches for 158 yards and two touchdowns. It was enough to earn him Offensive Player of the Game honors, and in quarterback Darron Thomasâ eyes, the award was well-deserved.  âLT been working hard all year,â Thomas said. âItâs destined to happen for him; that guy has been working hard ever since the jump. He was one of the guys that was working through injury all year, itâs destined to happen for that guy â it just pays off.â Tuineiâs second touchdown early in the fourth quarter gave Oregon the lead for good, and he also came up with a key fourth down conversion on the Ducksâ penultimate drive of the game.  âI think everyone had a chip on their shoulder for those last two (BCS) games I guess,â Tuinei said. âEveryone stepped up with game.â Looking Forward to 2012 Though the status of James remains up in the air, Oregon should be well-equipped to continue its Pac-12 dominance with or without the star running back.  Both junior running back Kenjon Barner and true freshman DeâAnthony Thomas are expected to return, as is quarterback Darron Thomas. Offensive linemen Nick Cody, Hroniss Grasu and Carson York will also be back, as will defensive stalwarts Michael Clay, John Boyett and Dion Jordan.  Though a loaded U.S.C. squad looms after Matt Barkley decided to return for his senior year, Oregon appears to be poised for more success next season â especially with yet another burgeoning superstar in Thomas, who broke a Rose Bowl record on Monday with 314 all-purpose yards and still has plenty of room to improve.  âI feel like I’ve got to work on everything,â Thomas said. âJust when the season comes, we’ll just start all over and work harder just like I did this summer. Just be a leader again for my team. Just excel with the freshman class that’s coming up next year, and it’s going to be great to watch.â If Thomas can improve upon a season that saw him gain 2,235 all-purpose yards, and the rest of the team remains mostly intact and healthy, 2012 could bring even better things for the newly minted Rose Bowl champions.
