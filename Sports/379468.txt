JOHNS CREEK, Ga. â Ryo Ishikawa made quite a splash Thursday at the P.G.A. Championship. In fact, he made a half-dozen of them. Ishikawa, a 19-year-old from Japan, took to the seemingly ubiquitous water at Atlanta Athletic Club like a duck â and left like a wounded one. Six shots found their resting place at the bottom of ponds, inflating his score to 85. Some players took more swings but, because of the assessed penalties, Isihikawa, the fieldâs second-youngest player, was headed to the dayâs ugliest round. Speaking through a translator, Ishikawa seemed uncertain whether to pin his erratic play on physical discomfort, lack of execution or nerves.  âI felt a little stiffer than yesterday,â he said, tracing the sensation to the first drenching on his second hole. Since the United States Open, Ishikawa has been altering his swing on the fly. âI had a pretty flat kind of swing,â he said, having decided to inject more arc. Results were encouraging last weekend, with fourth-place finish at the W.G.C.-Bridgestone Open. Two practice rounds at the A.A.C. revealed no backsliding. âMy technique, that was the culprit,â he said. At the same time, Ishikawa acknowledged the magnitude of this week. âMajor tournaments, usually I feel a little more tense,â he said. In last yearâs majors, Ishikawa missed two cuts and closed out another with an 80. This year signaled an upgrade. He countered a quick exit from the British Open by tying for 20th and 30th in the other two before Thursdayâs surfing safari. âThis is the first time Iâve hit so many waters,â he said. Exactly how many times, Ishikawa lost track. Staggered by a stretch on the front nine by three double-bogeys and one triple, he had drawn a bead on the tournament record for futility â a 94 by Gary Campbell 34 years ago â but steadied himself with pars on the five incoming holes. âI definitely feel for him,â said his playing partner Adam Scott, who kept count of the amphibious landings. âIâve been in that position.â No tour player has held his exalted position of generosity: pledging his entire season earnings, now $490,964, to earthquake relief in his homeland. Ishikawa dismissed the notion that his promise to hand over all winnings has added a layer of pressure this week. âThe tournaments I donate from are throughout the whole season,â he said. âSo, as long as I can make some contributions, I feel fine.â
