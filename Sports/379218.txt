Advertisement  The International Boxing Federation has ordered a rematch between middleweight champion JAMES TONEY and DAVE TIBERI after Toney's split-decision victory over Tiberi on Saturday in Atlantic City. "Under ordinary circumstances we don't encourage rematches," said BOB LEE, the I.B.F.'s president. "But we felt someone was short-changed here because of the wide disparity in scoring on the part of the judges." One judge gave Tiberi a 117-111 margin in the 12-round fight while the other two gave the decision to Toney, 115-112 and 115-113. Lee said the rematch would be staged within 90 days.
