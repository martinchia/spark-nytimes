The Giantsâ 21-17 win over the New England Patriots on NBC Sunday in Super Bowl XLVI was the most watched ever, with 111.3 million viewers, narrowly edging out the 111 million for last year’s game. A record has been set in three successive years. When Super Bowl XLIV generated 106.5 million viewers two years ago, it broke the United States prime-time TV record set by the 1983 finale of “M*A*S*H.” Then, it leaped by 4.5 million viewers last year to 111 million for Green Bay’s victory. On Sunday, viewership grew steadily in each half-hour, starting with 99.2 million from 6:31-7 p.m., Eastern. It then peaked at 117.7 million from 9:30 to 9:58, when the Giants were driving to their game-winning touchdown. While its 47.0 rating is only the sixth-best in Super Bowl history, it is the highest in 26 years. And among adults 18 to 49, the 40.5 rating is the highest since Super Bowl XXX in 1996. The Giants have now been in five Super Bowls. Their first, in 1987, had 87.2 million viewers, a figure that dipped four years later to 79.5 million — nearly 40 million fewer than on Sunday. For Super Bowl XXXV against Baltimore in 2001, an average of 84.3 million watched. And four years ago, 97.4 million watched when the Giants also  beat New England. If the Super Bowl audience is, in any way, a referendum on the popularity of its half-time performer, Madonna was a winner. Her performance between 8 and 8:30 had 114 million viewers, nearly four million more than for the Black Eyed Peas last year, and the most dating back to 1991.  Boston led all the markets with a 56.7 rating,the best ever for a National Football League game. And the New York rating of a 49.7 was that market’s second best for an N.F.L. game, behind Super Bowl XXI, the Giants’ first Super Bowl victory, against Denver.
