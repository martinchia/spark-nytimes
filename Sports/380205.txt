Alabama linebackers versus L.S.U.âs Jordan Jefferson
Jefferson took over as the Tigersâ starting quarterback after his performance against Alabama in the teamsâ first game, a 9-6 overtime victory by L.S.U. The Tigers struggled offensively in that game. Some of their best offensive plays in the second half were option rushes by Jefferson. Alabama linebackers Dontâa Hightower and Courtney Upshaw are expected to be chosen in the first two rounds of the N.F.L. draft and will be the key to slowing Jefferson on the ground. Number to Watch
One.
The number of interceptions thrown by Alabamaâs A J McCarron in the first meeting. (Receiver Marquis Maze threw another.) Morris Claiborneâs interception of McCarron and his ensuing 33-yard return set up the game-tying field goal. Expect whichever team throws fewer interceptions to win because neither quarterback will dominate the game. Quotation of the Week
“Iâd expect it to be big-boy football.”
â L.S.U. Coach Les Miles
The L.S.U. assistant John Chavis called the last meeting the most physical game he had seen in coaching in the Southeastern Conference for more than two decades.
