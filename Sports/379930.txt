Howard Beck, who covers the N.B.A. for The Times, answers questions from readers. Ultimately under the new C.B.A., the cap is still a “soft” one, right? It seems like there will always be owners with near-unlimited funds/zeal/big-market revenue willing to overspend on their teams despite the luxury tax. Given that our own Knicks’ Dolan has always been one of those owners, and that parsimonious Walsh is now out of the picture, isn’t it inevitable that the Knicks will go over the cap again soon? Why does everyone say it’s impossible to add a third star, when all it takes is boatloads of money that we already know Dolan is willing to spend?–Lecram, Staten Island, N.Y. Yes, the N.B.A. is keeping the âsoftâ cap, but it will be much more restrictive. Teams that pay the luxury tax will lose full the midlevel exception, limiting their ability to compete for free agents. Starting in Year 3, taxpayers will be banned from acquiring players in sign-and-trade deals â which, really, is the only way for capped-out teams to add established stars. On top of that, the luxury tax is becoming much more punitive, so even the richest teams will have to rein themselves in. Itâs important to note that, even with a âsoftâ cap, N.B.A. teams cannot just go out and bid on any free agent, as teams in Major League Baseball do. If youâre over the cap, all you have is cap âexceptionsâ â the midlevel, the biannual, the veteranâs minimum, etc. As an over-the-cap team, the Knicks cannot, for instance, bid on Tyson Chandler right now, because he will surely command at least $12 million in a starting salary. The Knicks are limited to using the midlevel, worth about $5 million. (Taxpaying teams can only use the new âminiâ midlevel, worth $3 million.) The Knicks could have about $13 million in cap room next summer, but even that would not be enough to sign a âmaxâ player such as Dwight Howard or Chris Paul, who could command more than $17 million. In the N.B.A., the only way to stockpile superstars is either to draft them (as Oklahoma City has) or tear down your roster and start over (as the Knicks and Heat did). From the left coast: Assuming the Golden State Warriors can clear cap space by amnestying Biedrins and moving Monta Ellis for a full-sized SG who plays defense, what two moves do you think they should make to become a credible playoff team?–Mikeyz, Albany, Calif. I like both of your ideas, Mikeyz from Albany. The Warriors eventually have to break up that undersized backcourt, and as electrifying as Ellis is, heâs undersized and defensively challenged. They need a tough, defensive-minded center next to David Lee. They are pursuing Tyson Chandler, which is the right move. But to clear enough cap room, they will probably need to use the amnesty clause on Biedrins (as you suggest), rather than on Charlie Bell (which they are currently discussing). As you know, the Warriors are also in the hunt for Chris Paul, although it would probably cost them Stephen Curry. It would be a bold move, but thatâs what it takes to be a contender in the N.B.A. There are only a dozen true difference-makers (or less) in this league. Paul is one of them. Can the amnesty clause be used on players acquired via trade AFTER this new C.B.A. is ratified, but whose contracts were inked before the new C.B.A.?–The Borg, Florida Iâm a little intimidated by answering questions from the Borg. But as I understand it, resistance is futile, so here goes: No, teams cannot use the amnesty clause on players acquired in a trade. A team can only use the provision on a player currently on its roster (as of the end of the lockout) and on contracts that were signed before July 1, 2011. Every team will be able to use the provision once during this collective bargaining agreement. Should the Knicks be brave enough to trade Amare and Carmelo (total salaries: 36 mil) to Orlando before the season begins to obtain Howard, Nelson and Anderson (tot: 25 mil) and any draft picks that they can wrangle–they would still have money left over for either Paul or Williams next year. Also with Billups’ contract expiring in 2012 that would open up another 14 million–perhaps that would be enough for both Paul & Williams.  I know its a far-fetched, fantasy trade but a New York team consisting of Howard and Anderson up front with Paul and Williams in the back would be quite formidable–don’t you agree? Also, depending on how much they offer in long-term contracts to their stars–there might be a few dollars left over to pursue players to round out the team. Do you think this is doable?–Simon Eng, New York City The key word in your question was âfantasy.â No team needs both Paul and Williams. Either one would suffice. The Knicksâ goal at this point is to surround Stoudemire and Anthony with the right mix of talent, not to trade them away and start over yet again. That said, Iâd argue that they should be willing to trade one of them if it could get them Howard or Paul. (Iâll rule out Williams, since the Nets are not about to send him across the river.) No team wins a championship without solid defense, and Howard is the fiercest interior defender in the league. Paul is a stout defender at point guard and is a gifted playmaker. The Knicks have a ton of scoring, but Stoudemire and Anthony are indifferent as defenders and playmakers.  As it stands, the Knicks probably will not have the cap room to add a third max player next summer (see above). Even if they did, Iâm not sure itâs a wise move to add Paul to Stoudemire and Anthony. Those three would be making about $57 million under a cap of about $58-60 million, leaving the Knicks with no room to add anyone else. The Heat can get away with that approach, because LeBron James and Dwyane Wade are elite two-way players and fantastic passers who make everyone around them better. You canât say the same for Stoudemire and Anthony, as great as they are. The Knicksâ roster would be terribly weak after those three. Is there a team besides the Knicks with two max contract players and a similar salary cap quandary moving forward?–Benjamin, New York  GIven the parameters of the new C.B.A., how might the Knicks (or anyone in a similar situation) best fill out a team around their superstars if they can’t compete for further upper echelon players? When Chauncey and Amare both came up injured in the Celtics series, Marv Albert memorably called the assembled team “Carmelo Anthony and a bunch of guys.” And he wasn’t too far off. Put another way, is a team that signs two players at max now relegated to being top-heavy and shallow? A team with two max (or near-max) players has ample flexibility. Stoudemire and Anthony, for instance, are making about $37 million this season, with the cap around $58 million. The trouble starts when you add a third high-end player, as the Knicks currently have with Chauncey Billups making $14.2 million. The Knicks will have cap room next summer, when Billupsâ contract expires. But as I outlined in a previous response, adding a third max player essentially takes the Knicks out of free agency, making it tough to fill out the roster. But then, that is the whole point of a salary-cap system: to prevent teams from hoarding elite players. What about Dwight Howard for Amare? Why does no one talk about this seriously? Since the league owned Hornets will almost definitely not send Paul to New York for nothing, why not trade for the second best player in the league? I understand the potential PR backlash, but Melo and Dwight is a championship contender almost immediately and then they can finally start using their money. And, by the way, Amare is from Orlando. –Adam L, Los Angeles As I mentioned above I believe the Knicks should at least consider trading Stoudemire or Anthony, if it would bring Howard — the leagueâs best center by far — or an elite point guard such as Paul. I think the Stoudemire-Anthony tandem is unwieldy. As we saw last season, both players were most effective when the other was on the bench. Their chemistry should improve with a training camp and a (semi-)full season, but they are both scoring-minded forwards who do not pass or defend much. The Knicks need more balance in the lineup. Obviously, the Knicks front office has other ideas. They seem determined to have a three-star lineup, no matter the cost. Itâs a great way to sell tickets, but Iâm not sure it will get the Knicks to the finals.  Some teams have players under contract in China, who will not be released to play in the N.B.A. until March. How will this affect their N.B.A. teams’ cap space? Will the value of their contracts be prorated for the season, or can the teams get cap relief for these salaries through March?–Ken Somolinos, Denver The players in China â including Denverâs J.R. Smith, Wilson Chandler and Kenyon Martin â are all free agents. But they remain on the payroll as âcap holdsâ unless the Nuggets renounce their Bird rights. In short, Denver has to make a decision now about whether they want to retain the Bird rights to re-sign any of those players in March (after the season ends in China) or cut them loose now to create cap room. My best guess is the Nuggets will renounce the rights to Martin and Smith but retain the rights to Chandler if possible. Any player returning in March will sign a pro-rated contract for the balance of the N.B.A. season. Howard, great work during the lockout; I greatly appreciated it. The Hornets (i.e. the N.B.A.) hold all the chips in the Paul situation. Why do people keep saying that Billups and other expiring contracts from the Knicks are valuable pieces to be offered in a trade? Isn’t that totally wrong? If I’m the hornets I do not want expiring contracts because if I let Paul go that in its self clears cap space. Isn’t this where the new C.B.A. pays big benefits to owners such as the Hornets, who can say to Paul, “Fine, leave and lose $20 million in guaranteed cash?” If I’m the Hornets looking for valuable assets who can play.–Phil, New York A large, expiring contract such as Billupsâ ($14.2 million) is only valuable to a team that is looking to dump salary (in the form of a long-term contract). The Hornets donât need cap relief; they need great young talent and draft picks to rebuild. I donât see Billups having any value in a Chris Paul deal, unless it involves a third team. Please tell me the Knicks have a backup plan in the likely event they are unable to get Dwight Howard, Chris Paul, or Deron Williams. Assuming these three guys are not going to give up $15-20 million to play here, what targets should/will they go after both this year and next?–Frank, New York At the moment, it appears to be three-max-players-or-bust. I donât get the sense that the Knicks have a Plan B. But they could use that $13 million of cap room next summer in a lot of other ways. Do the Knicks have a chance of solving any of their major problems — defense, rebounding, depth — this season, or do we have to wait until 2012-13? Also, why should the Knicks limit themselves to signing only one-year deals? I know they want to keep salary cap space available for next year’s crop of free agents (Chris Paul, Dwight Howard, Deron Williams, etc.), but they’ll need other players on their team then as well. If the price is right, why not sign a longer-term contract now?–Adam, New York It appears that the Knicks are absolutely determined to protect their 2012 cap room, for better or worse. If they stick to that approach, I canât see them making any major upgrades for this season. They have to hope that Ronny Turiaf stays healthy, that Jared Jeffries can play major minutes at center and that Iman Shumpert, their rookie guard, is as great a defender as advertised. The Knicks have no trade assets. Can the idea of CP3 going to NY be dismissed, or do I actually have to get my hopes up?–Andrew, New York Short answer: Donât get your hopes up. Long answer: The Knicksâ only advantage in the Chris Paul sweepstakes is that Chris Paul wants to be in New York. That is not an insignificant factor, of course. Paul can refuse to sign an extension with any team that acquires him and can become a free agent next summer. But whichever team holds Paulâs rights next summer can pay him $26 million more than the Knicks can. If the Knicks cannot clear more cap room, the gap will be even greater.  For now, the Hornets will do whatever is best for them. That means trading Paul for the best package they can get. And there are a few teams who are willing to acquire Paul without long-term assurances (including Houston and Dallas). The Knicks do not have the trade assets to compete, so they can only hope that other suitors are scared off by Paulâs threats to leave as a free agent.
