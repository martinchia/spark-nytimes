PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. â There were 37 golfers who putted better than Tiger Woods at the Abu Dhabi Championship last month, but a belly or long putter is apparently not the prescription for what ails him on the greens.  Describing himself as a traditionalist, Woods said he was opposed to putters that can be anchored against the body. Implicit in the art of putting is âcontrolling the body and club and swinging the pendulum motion,â Woods explained Tuesday during a news conference for this weekâs Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. âI believe thatâs how it should be played.â  A growing number of players have experimented with the belly putter. They include Phil Mickelson, who returned to the blade putter he used growing up after a brief flirtation with an Odyssey belly putter made to mirror the one Keegan Bradley used to win last yearâs P.G.A. Championship.  The long putter is legal, although the United States Golf Association is studying its effect on scoring and may rule on it in the future.  âMy idea was to have it so that the putter would be equal to or less than the shortest club in your bag,â Woods said. âAnd I think with that weâd be able to get away from any type of belly anchoring.â  Woods said he had discussed his views on the subject with Peter Dawson, the leader of the Royal and Ancient, golfâs governing body outside the United States and Mexico.  âPeterâs looked into it for a number of years, trying to get it to work,â Woods said, âand you actually measure everybodyâs sand wedge and putter before you go out and play. Thatâs another thing.â
