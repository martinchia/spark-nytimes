Advertisement By AL HARVIN Winning. While Don Shula has perfected a formula for it, averaging more than 10 victories a season with two different National Football League teams, Bruce Coslet is still trying to get the knack of it. Shula, who coached the Colts before he moved on to Miami, was the youngest coach to win 100 games in the league, and the youngest to win 200. Last Sunday, the Dolphins presented him with a 16-13 victory over Green Bay making him 2-2 this year and only the second coach in pro football history to win 300 games (his record is 300-139-6). George Halas had a coaching record of 325-151-31 in 36 years. Shula, by comparison, is in his 29th year. Coslet's record as coach of the Jets after one full season and the first part of this one is 7-13. The Jets are 1-3 in 1991 after losing three straight games. "The thing that impresses me about Don Shula is his ability to adjust," said Coslet, who has been to one Super Bowl as offensive coordinator of the Cincinnati Bengals. Shula has been to six Super Bowls, winning two, and is the only coach to win all of his games in one year, 17 in 1972.

Advertisement People have been asking Coslet all week if, and how, his Jets are going to be able to bounce back from two disappointing losses -- 23-20 to the Buffalo Bills two weeks ago and and 19-13 in overtime Monday night to the Chicago Bears -- to beat Miami today at Giants Stadium. And they have been asking Shula what he thought about victory No. 300 and if he is thinking about victory No. 326 -- probably a couple of years away -- which would break Halas's mark. "The players presented me with a plaque and I got lots of telegrams, phone calls and letters and I'm sure I'm going to look back on that and enjoy it someday, but right now the important thing is this week and next week," said the 61-year-old Shula, who succeeded Weeb Ewbank as Baltimore's coach in 1963. "No. 326?" said Shula. "Again, you know it's out there and if I can be productive and stay healthy and someday hold that record it'll be very meaningful. But it's going to have to be something that happens naturally, the way 100 and 200 and 300 happened." A Little More Conservative? On Sept. 15, 1963, when Shula, then 33 years old, made his N.F.L. coaching debut with a 37-28 loss to the Giants, Marino was celebrating his second birthday. Although Marino, Miami's No. 1 draft choice out of Pittsburgh in 1983, is still the Dolphins' quarterback at age 30, his team seems to be in a bit of a transition of styles. Some people have said Shula and Marino have gone conservative in their old age. Marino has never gone three games without throwing a touchdown pass. Now, for only the second time in his career, he has gone two games without throwing for a touchdown. Last year, he was sacked 15 times, the fewest of any starting quarterback in the N.F.L. This season, he has already been sacked nine times in four games. Has he lost a step?  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

"Dan never had a step," said Jets defensive tackle Dennis Byrd, who was the team's leading sacker last season with 13. "Don't make that sound bad. It's because he's had such a phenomenal offensive line that he's never had to run. I don't see any of his pass protection breaking down. I see a lot of good individual effort against him on defense, and if anything, Dan is holding the ball maybe a second longer. Getting hit doesn't seem to bother him as much as it used to. He's taking punches a little bit better." Advertisement "We've been struggling along the whole offensive line because of injuries, people reporting late, not working together," said Marino. "Richmond Webb was out of camp, hurt, and we haven't really got to the point the offensive line was at last year. It was really playing well and coming around." Some Memorable Matchups Last year, the Dolphins won both of their games against the Jets, rallying from a 13-0 halftime deficit in Week 5 to win on a pair of Marino passes to Mark Duper, then holding the Jets without a touchdown in a 17-3 triumph at Giants Stadium. But everybody remembers the Jets' 51-45 victory in 1986, in an overtime thriller, when Ken O'Brien hit 29 of 43 passes for 479 yards and 4 touchdowns. Marino was 30 for 50 for 448 yards and 6 touchdowns in that same game. In September 1988, Marino was 35 for 60 for a career-high 521 yards against the Jets, but he was intercepted 5 times and the Dolphins lost, 44-30. But he still has a 9-5 record against New York. While the Dolphins have sacked O'Brien 33 times over all, the Jets have managed to get to Marino just 14 times and only twice since 1986. Mark Clayton, Miami's leading receiver in yards this season with 241 on 15 catches, is questionable for today's game with a groin injury. His counterpart, Duper, has caught 14 passes for 210 yards. Running back Sammie Smith, who suffered a knee injury in the preseason, is eligible to be reactivated and just might be, but Mark Higgs has been rushing well for Miami with 371 yards on 94 carries and 2 touchdowns. "The biggest difference I've noticed -- I mean the only difference I've noticed -- in Marino is that he's been getting sacked more than in the last three years," said Jets free safety Erik McMillan, who had 3 of the 5 Jets interceptions in that 1988 Jets victory but has since been demoted to substituting and playing on special teams. "Other than that, that's still Dan Marino and he can still throw for 500 yards on you, on anybody. Hopefully, he doesn't have one of those 500-yard games against us."
