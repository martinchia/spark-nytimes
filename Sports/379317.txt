A brief recap of an afternoon spent bingeing on Super Bowl coverage: NFL Network, 12:40 Eastern Time: Kara Armstrong, Brian Baldinger and Rod Woodson stand alone in the middle of an indoor practice field discussing the best way to tackle Ben Roethlisberger. Football experts have reached consensus that Roethlisberger simply cannot be sacked, overlooking the fact that it has been done 221 times in the last five years. Baldinger grabs a football and invites Woodson to demonstrate his tackling technique. The two men size each other up briefly, then think better of it. Armstrong throws the broadcast over to Deion Sanders and Emmitt Smith, who talk about essentially nothing. Smith talks about coaching his sonâs youth football team; âWhat kind of father are you?â asks Sanders, channeling his inner Oprah. Smith wears a heavy overcoat and a thick scarf, Sanders looks comfortable in a double-breasted pinstripe suit. The pinstripes may actually be defrosters, like the ones on your rear window.

The Fan, 93.7 FM Pittsburgh, 1:05 Eastern Time: Itâs the Vinny and Cook Show, but Vinnie Richichi is by himself in the studio, with Ron Cook reporting from Texas. The previous hour of the show featured numerous guests. âI feel like Allen Ludden from Password,â Richichi says, a feeling all of us experience at some time or another. Richichi airs a long segment from Mike Tomlinâs news conference. A reporter asks about helmet safety; Tomlin admits that he doesnât know the science behind equipment issues and defers to the experts. âI take a minimalistic approach to those things,â he says. Tomlin says, âEt cetera, et cetera, et cetera,â a few times during the interview. When he retires, the minimalist Tomlin can star in a Dogma 95 remake of “The King and I.” Richichi receives a picture of Maurkice Pouncey with no cast on his leg, then launches on a Pouncey soliloquy: the Packers may have to prepare for two different centers, the Packers may want to pack up and go home if a healthy Pouncey walks onto the field, offensive line coach Sean Kugler may upset the balance on the offensive line if he starts a not-quite-healthy Pouncey over Doug Legursky. âDoes it even affect the dynamic of the offensive line?â Richichi asks callers. Answer carefully: the fate of the free world rests on a rookie center most football fans could not even name before the Jets game. ESPN2, 1:20 Eastern Time: On “First Take,” Skip Bayless and Rob Parker debate how many passing yards Aaron Rodgers and Roethlisberger will throw for on Sunday. Bayless is typically animated and histrionic. He calls Packers safety Sam Shields a âgodsend,â claims Ben Roethlisberger is the âmost underrated passer in the National Football League.â He criticizes Steelers safety Ryan Clark mercilessly for his inadequacies in deep coverage, a problem both Bill Cowher and Mike Tomlin somehow failed to notice. Occasionally, Parker speaks.  My television malfunctions after two minutes, and I welcome the static. ESPNU, 1:30 Eastern Time: Today is National Signing Day, the official day for prep football prospects to sign college commitment letters. Both ESPNU and the CBS College Sports network provided morning-long coverage of 17- and 18-year-olds announcing where they will play football, and conceivably take courses, next year. CBS gave up early in the day, but ESPNU is still going strong, with a five-expert panel discussing the quality of Auburnâs recruiting class in the wake of the Cam Newton controversy. A crawl lists top prospects along the bottom of the screen, a team-by-team breakdown of recruits occupies the right of the screen. The Ohio State recruit Curtis Grant appears via satellite from his high school. The host asks Grant what separates the Ohio State recruiting class from the others entering the Big Ten. What a remarkable question to ask a teenager taking a break from history class to make a media appearance. âHey kid, did you break down the Northwestern recruiting class at all? You did what instead? Passed your driving test and worked a shift at Burger King so you could afford prom tickets? Get your act together!â Get ready, Grant: in five years, you may be on a Super Bowl podium answering questions about a teammateâs Twitter account. NFL Network, 1:57 Eastern Time: Rich Eisen, Steve Mariucci and Jamie Dukes discuss Roethlisbergerâs legacy. Then, Armstrong, Woodson and Baldinger discuss Roethlisbergerâs legacy. On Nickelodeon, SpongeBob and Patrick debate Roethlisbergerâs legacy. Patrick calls Sam Shields a âgodsend.â Syndicated radio, 2:05 Eastern Time. Jim Rome interviews the Packers great Jerry Kramer, asking for advice for dealing with the cold weather. âPretend like you got Deacon Jones chasing you,â Kramer suggests. Rome says that will make him scared, not warm. âGet you some down. Get you some boots to keep your feet warm,â Kramer says. Kramer then talks about Vince Lombardiâs philosophy, the coaching legendâs knowledge of ancient Greek and Latin, and the lifelong effect Lombardiâs coaching had on his players. The old Packers war stories and discussion of timeless values provide a momentary break from the relentlessly in-the-moment nature of the afternoonâs coverage. It does not last. NFL Network, 2:10 Eastern Time: John Elway is Rich Eisenâs guest. Elway wears a magenta-colored dress shirt with blue stripes, unbuttoned daringly low. Elway coughs a few times during the interview; he needs to get him some down, get him some boots. After 10 minutes of talk about the Broncos, Eisen realizes the broadcast has drifted off-topic. âDoes Roethlisberger remind you of you?â he asks Elway. Elway says he does, listing all of their similarities. âThey canât bring him down, and he makes those big plays.â After two hours, we have learned one thing: you cannot bring Roethlisberger down, except when you do. The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
