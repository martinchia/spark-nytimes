Advertisement  The Nets, who have until 5 P.M. tomorrow to decide whether to match the lucrative Detroit Piston offer to backup power forward Terry Mills are not likely to make a decision much before then, Willis Reed, the team's senior vice president for basketball operations, said yesterday. That delay, Reed said, is partly because Mills's refusal to meet with him in Detroit yesterday has made the decision more difficult and partly because the full Nets ownership will not meet before late today. Reed said that the team's main priority was in keeping its starting five together, including re-signing small forward Chris Morris. Reed would not discuss the alternatives to retaining Mills, a limited free agent who received a five-year, $9.4 million offer. Although he expressed disappointment that Mills would not show him "the common courtesy" of meeting with him yesterday, Reed said he respected the desire of the former Detroit high school standout and University of Michigan star to continue his career in his hometown. In deciding whether to retain Mills, the Nets would not be limited by a lack of money, Reed said. As soon as they received the Pistons' offer sheet two weeks ago, Reed said, the team lined up a sufficient line of credit from a consortium of banks. "The money's there," he said.
