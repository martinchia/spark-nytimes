DALLAS â Curtis Martinâs career with New England and the Jets was much like the man himself: understated, consistent, workmanlike. Only Martin and Barry Sanders topped 1,000 rushing yards in each of their first 10 seasons. Only Emmitt Smith, Walter Payton and Sanders gained more rushing yards than Martinâs 14,101. Yet Martin is no lock to make the Hall of Fame on Saturday. The field includes first-year eligible players in Deion Sanders, Marshall Faulk, Jerome Bettis and Willie Roaf, along with a host of holdovers, all considered for up to five modern-day slots. In fact, Martin said on a conference call this week that he was prepared for either way the decision went. In a text message, he said he had not made plans to come here and would travel to the Super Bowl only if he were inducted.

“Itâs a tremendous honor,â Martin said on the call. âIf I get in, Iâll be elated. If I donât, I donât think thereâs anything wrong with the voting system. The Hall of Fame is special. If it doesnât happen for me this year, hopefully some other year.â Martin never planned to become a football player in the first place, never truly loved the game, despite playing for 11 seasons. He found the sport because his mother forced him to play football to keep him away from the dangers on the Pittsburgh streets. From there, one coach spied Martin in gym class, begged him to turn out and started him in a scrimmage four days later. On his first carry, Martin sprinted for an 80-yard touchdown, âas though it was just like fate,â he said. Martin never cared much for individual awards, but he said a Hall of Fame induction would mean more than he anticipated it would. The nomination dotted his arms with goosebumps. An informal poll of five Hall of Fame voters painted a muddled picture of Martinâs chances. All five said Martinâs career deserved consideration, but none of the five considered his credentials worthy of a slam dunk, and only one believed Martin will be inducted this year.
Two less objective voices believe Martin should be. Bill Parcells, Martinâs former coach, said in an interview a few months back: âI donât know what else you have to do. Heâs separated himself in so many ways. For me, just being the fourth-leading rusher in history is enough.â Woody Johnson, the Jetsâ owner, said: âIâm biased, but I would vote for him. His accomplishments speak for himself. It would mean everything for him to get in.â The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
