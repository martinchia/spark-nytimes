CLEVELAND â Reverse the letters on the back of Johnny Damonâs jersey, and they spell nomad. That is what Damon has become as he bounces around the American League, from the Yankees in 2009 to the Detroit Tigers last season to the Tampa Bay Rays now. Damon, 37, is one of those modern stars who will be an alumnus of many teams, mostly because of short-term free-agent contracts. Rickey Henderson played for nine teams, Gary Sheffield eight, Roberto Alomar seven. Damon has played for six, but he will always be identified mostly with the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, his teams for four years apiece. If he makes the Hall of Fame, the cap on his plaque should have a hologram alternating between the interlocking NY and the Red Sox B. Damon, a Hall of Famer? His hitting coach for the Rays, Derek Shelton, believes that he should be. âI do, 100 percent,â Shelton said. âAnd I think the thing that gets kind of lost is he played on some really good teams, and everybody talked about everybody else while he just continued having good year after good year. You look at the end body of work, and youâre seeing a guy thatâs going to be a Hall of Famer.â Damon has never won a batting title, and his weak arm kept him from being much of a fielder. But he has a good chance to amass 3,000 hits, and every eligible player to reach that milestone has a spot in Cooperstown, except for Rafael Palmeiro, who failed a steroids test.  Only four other players can match Damonâs career totals for hits, runs, home runs and stolen bases: Barry Bonds, Paul Molitor, Craig Biggio and Henderson. Biggio and Damon have nearly identical combined on-base and slugging percentages: .796 for Biggio, .790 for Damon, through Friday. Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez, Damonâs former Yankees teammates, are almost certain to reach 3,000 hits. The only other active players with more hits than Damon are part-timers, Ivan Rodriguez and Omar Vizquel, who seem unlikely to get there. Damon, who reached 2,600 on May 5, believes he can. The sudden retirement of Manny Ramirez in April shifted Damon to the designated hitter role, which he said kept him stronger. âBefore it was always like, well, I canât play too hard,â Damon said, referring to playing with his children away from the field. âBut now, as a D.H., I can swim and actually keep my body in shape a lot better now. I wake up, and I lift. I swim a lot. It almost feels like itâs my off-season, but I play baseball.â Damon, who had 146 hits last season, did the math at his locker before a game against the Cleveland Indians last week. If he gets 150 hits this season, he would have 2,721. Two more years of 140 hits each would then put him at 3,001. âWeâve never talked about it, but I think it means a lot to him,â Shelton said. âHe has great pride in the people that he passes on the hit list as he goes along, and he has a lot of respect for what theyâve done in the game, and itâs special. I hope he does it in a Ray uniform.â Damon said he did not miss wearing the uniform of the Yankees or the Red Sox. He won a World Series with each team, and has helped the Rays stay close to the Yankees in the American League East this season. When he sees his former teams play on national television, as they will again Sunday, Damon said he was content. âIâm just glad that when I did play there, I accomplished a lot of cool things,â Damon said. âBeing in Detroit last year kind of made you sit back and say, âWow, baseball could be actually pretty fun and enjoyable.â âI mean, I commend people who can play in those markets their entire career. I guess thatâs why thereâs never been a 3,000-hit guy for the Yankees. The city adds a couple of years on them. Even though itâs the best city in the world, thereâs that grind. When you leave for the ballpark, youâre like, âO.K., itâs time to be on.â âBeing in Tampa, I can leave the house at 3:30 after spending a couple of hours by the pool playing with the kids, so I feel like I have a life that I can enjoy, and then I go play a kidâs game for a couple of hours. At this point in my career, itâs the best thing.â The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
