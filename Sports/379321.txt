CLEVELAND — Syracuse guard Scoop Jardine, who finished Fridayâs 77-60 victory over Indiana State on the bench with ice on his left wrist after a second-half tumble, said it would not keep him from facing Marquette on Sunday. âIâm fine,â he said Saturday. âI was fine yesterday. Like I said, if we play today, Iâd be playing.â  Practices on Saturday were closed to the news media, and Jardine spoke before Syracuse took the floor at Quicken Loans Arena. Jardine, who shoots with his right hand, originally hurt the wrist several weeks ago. Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim shrugged off a question about facing another Big East opponent so early in the tournament. The game between Cincinnati and Connecticut on Saturday in Washington was the first time teams from the same conference played in the Round of 32. Of course, with 11 Big East teams in the tournament, it might have been tricky to avoid.

On Friday, though, Boeheim said; âI think itâs a bad thing. Iâm sure thereâs some reason for it, that both us and Connecticut and Cincinnati and Marquette are playing. I guess itâs something that probably had to be, I guess, although when you look at things, you see where it wouldnât necessarily have to be that way. But it is.  âI like to play other teams when we get to the N.C.A.A., to tell you the truth. But it is what it is. Weâve got to get ready to play.â Marquette Coach Buzz Williams, who has a fanatical interest in numbers and statistics, said he was not sure the selection committee could have kept Big East teams apart until the Round of 16.  âI think the committee has probably taken some undeserving shots,â he said.  Marquette, which joined the Big East in 2005, had never beaten Syracuse in Big East play until a 76-70 victory in Milwaukee on Jan. 29. However, after losing to Louisville in the Big East Tournament at Madison Square Garden, Williams said he told an assistant he was thankful to not be playing a conference team until next Christmas.  âAnd so on Sunday,â he said, âweâre doing the Selection Show, and they show Xavier first, theyâre the higher seed. Then they show us. Everybodyâs like, rah, rah, rah. And then the next team that pops up is Syracuse.â
