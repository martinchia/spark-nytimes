Mark Herzlich went with an age-old remedy for nerves Saturday as the Giants were cutting their roster to the league-mandated 53 players: food. Herzlich, Tyler Sash, Spencer Paysinger and Henry Hynoski ate out Saturday morning at an IHOP, where they âtried to get our minds off of it by gorging ourselves with pancakes.â Herzlich, a cancer survivor who played at Boston College, said he then went to a Chiliâs restaurant, where he spent the afternoon alone, watching his alma mater play on television. âI couldnât find it on TV anywhere else,â he said.
As the 6 p.m. deadline for cuts approached, he found himself continually checking his cellphone, hoping it would stay quiet. Once 6 p.m. passed, the backup linebacker could relax. âIt was the most anticlimactic happy ending that you could think of: âAll right, my phone didnât ring, letâs go celebrateâ type of thing,â he said. As it turned out, all of Herzlichâs morning companions made the team as well.  The Giantsâ situation at tight end has been murky since Kevin Boss signed with the Oakland Raiders, though it appears Jake Ballard is set to slide into the starting role, as Travis Beckum has struggled with the traditional blocking duties. Ballard, a second-year player out of Ohio State, âgot betterâ both at blocking and moving upfield in training camp, Coach Tom Coughlin said, and it is likely that he will move to the first position on the depth chart. Beckum, at 6 feet 3 inches tall and 234 pounds, is more likely to be used as a situational pass-catcher who is shifted around the offense. âI think it plays right into my hands and I did a lot of that in college,â Beckum said. âA lot of times when you move a tight end, you can see what coverage it is and obviously if you have man presnap, it is a big clue. Hopefully I can cure that and make mismatches against the defense.â * Over the past few weeks, Giants Coach Tom Coughlin had hedged on whether defensive end Osi Umenyiora would play in the Week 1 game against the Washington Redskins, but on Monday Coughlin finally ruled him out. Asked if Umenyiora, who has been recovering from an arthroscopic procedure on his right knee, had a chance to face the Redskins, Coughlin said: âI donât think so. Itâs a little early.â It is possible Umenyiora will also miss the Week 2 game against the St. Louis Rams, though that will not be determined until next week.
