Advertisement  Since the 1992 Summer Olymics began, Montjuic has been the Games' esthetic center. Yesterday, television viewers again thrilled to platform divers seemingly soaring above Barcelona as they plunged into a pool that sits atop the mountain. Now track and field has taken hold on the mountain in the 65,000-seat Olympic Stadium, which has also become the focus of some misplaced controversy. Montjuic actually means Mountain of the Jews. The stadium was built in an area that Jews had inhabited in Roman times for more than 600 years. The Inquisition led to their expulsion and escape from Spain 500 years ago. "They were a very important community, a significant weight in Spain," CAMILA GONZALEZ, a curator at Barcelona's Municipal History Museum, said of the Spanish Jews. "They used to say the king's lions were fed by Jewish taxes." Because so much attention has been focused this year on Montjuic, the Inquisition and a Jewish cemetery near the stadium, the Spanish Tourist Board in New York has been sensititve to reports that the Olympic Stadium was built on the cemetery site. So, Americans coming to the Games are provided with a letter written by Rabbi M. MITCHELL SERELS of Yeshiva University. It explains that there has been no desecration of a cemetery. In this case, at least, no Olympic problem. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
