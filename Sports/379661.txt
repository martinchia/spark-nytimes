A pair of Western Conference clubs improved their lineups for playoff runs this week by acquiring veteransÂ for future assets. Continuing a trend from a year ago, when the Devils acquired Ilya Kovalchuk and the Maple Leafs dealt for Dion Phaneuf, the Nashville Predators and Anaheim Ducks did not wait until the Feb. 28 trade deadline to make their moves. The Predators brought Mike Fisher (and his wife, the singer Carrie Underwood) to Nashville on Thursday by trading a 2011 first-round pick and a conditional draft choice to the Ottawa Senators. If the Predators are victorious in the first round of the playoffs, the pick is a second-rounder in 2012. If they lose, Ottawa will receive a third-round selection. Nashviille has qualified for the postseason five times in its 11 years in the N.H.L., but has yet to win a playoff round.  “Mike’s playoff experience will be invaluable to our team, and he makes us deeper and stronger,” Predators General Manager David Poile said of Fisher, who is under contract at a salary cap hit of $4.2 million for this season and two more. The Ducks reunited with defenseman Francois Beauchemin by acquiring him on Wednesday from the Maple Leafs for wing Joffrey Lupul, the defense prospect Jake Gardiner and a conditional fourth-round pick. Beauchemin, 30, was a member of the Ducks team that won the Stanley Cup in 2007. “He’s looking forward to coming back into Anaheim,” Ducks Coach Randy Carlyle told Monte Stewart of FanHouse. “He knows the way we run things, what our expectations are of him as a player, how we like to play, and he thinks he can make a contribution. We agree with that.” In the uneviable position as sellers looking to retool their rosters for next season and beyond, the Senators and the Maple Leafs received excellent value for their veterans. Even in a draft that does not have scouts giddy, Ottawa General Manager Bryan Murray’s acquisition of a 2011 first-round pick for Fisher was a mild surprise. Fisher, 30, has been a steady center in his 11-year career, helping the Senators reach the Stanley Cup finals in 2007, but he has topped 50 points only once. This season he had 14 goals and 24 points in 55 games with Ottawa. The key to the Beauchemin deal was Toronto General Manager Brian Burke’s insistence on the inclusion of Gardiner, a defenseman with offensive flair who was drafted by Anaheim 20th over all in the 2008 draft. A junior at the University of Wisconsin, the 6-foot-2, 185-pound Gardiner has 7 goals and 30 points in 30 games this season with the Badgers. Burke explained his reasons not to wait until the trade deadline to acquire Phaneuf last season and move Beauchemin this week. âIn my history I always try to beat the trade deadline,” Burke told Kevin McGran of The Toronto Star. “When you get to the trade deadline, itâs like a stampede. Thereâs lots of milling around, and lots of confusion, and I think itâs much more difficult to act with clarity and purpose at the deadline. Itâs almost like a party with a piÃ±ata; everyone is going for one player. Everyone is swinging at it. Itâs hard to focus.” By trading early, he said, “you can set your price — if you donât get your price, you can always wait.â In the case of the Fisher and Beauchemin trades, there was no need to wait. Murray got a pair of high draft picks, Burke priedÂ the A-level prospect he demanded. All four teams can declare they won their trades because they got what they wanted.
