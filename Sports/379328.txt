Not getting a single game in a match is called a âbicicletaâ in Spain, and a âdouble bagelâ in English-speaking countries. Whatever you want to call it, Dinara Safinaâs 44-minute loss to Kim Clijsters was another sad chapter in her decline. Her brother Marat (they are the first brother and sister to be ranked No. 1 in the world) also failed to live up to his potential.   In the spring 2009, Safina was the dominant woman on tour, and seemed poised to win her first Grand Slam at Roland Garros that year. She melted down that day against a calmer, steadier Svetlana Kuznetsova, and sheâs been in free fall ever since. In her match with Kim Clijsters (and, to be fair, thatâs a pretty rough draw), Safina showed little fight. She won only 16 points, while the razor-sharp Clijsters won 51 points. Safinaâs forehand looked especially loose, as she missed routine shots both long and wide.  What made the spectacle difficult to watch was the feeling that weâve seen this from Safina before. We read about a new coach, a new training regimen and a renewed sense of commitment to ascend the WTA rankings.  Safinaâs new coach, the Argentinian Gaston Etlis, looked irritated and beleaguered when she began glancing his way. Her pleading, plaintive looks to her box are the first tell at the beginning of a meltdown.  Etlis sat with his arms crossed, sighing heavily as Clijsters began running away with the match. For Safina, a disaster like this is a kind of double defeat. Because she put up little or no fight, and failed to compete against Clijsters, she has little to learn from this match. No risk, no reward. But she did make history, albeit ignominiously- she is the only former world No. 1 to lose 6-0, 6-0. If she is to regain the splendid form of two years ago, Safina will need to compete again. She must heed the words of the American writer James Baldwin: “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.â Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
