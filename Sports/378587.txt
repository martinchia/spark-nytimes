Advertisement  A new course at Duke offers fans an inside look at the sport that has made the Research Triangle area famous: college basketball. The course, offered in Duke's continuing education curriculum, is called Insights Into College Basketball. It offers no credits or grades but is already filled and has a waiting list of 100. The five-week course will be taught by PETER GAUDET, a member of Duke Coach MIKE KRZYZEWSKI's national championship staff. Gaudet will emphasize the technical points of the game, but he will also include plenty of anecdotal and historical tidbits. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
