TORONTO â After watching the Yankees’ offense go down meekly in 2 hours 25 minutes Tuesday night, one had to wonder if Andy Pettitte was the only member of the team still trying to make the playoffs.  That is likely not the case, but there is no doubt Pettitte gave everything he could to the cause Tuesday while the rest of the team lacked energy, as Alfonso Soriano put it.  Really? With only 12 games remaining and after a day off, the Yankees could not muster the energy to play what was  virtually a must-win game?  Maybe the rest of the team knows something Pettitte does not, or that he is refusing to acknowledge. Manager Joe Girardi, calm and almost dispassionate after Tuesdayâs game, certainly seemed resigned, and he said the team was âdarn closeâ to playing must-win games. So, as the only participating member of the 1990s dynasty Yankees in the game, Pettitte was a good person to ask if the team had the appropriate sense of urgency. âI hope so,â he said. âObviously, when you get shut out I guess maybe it doesnât look like it. If thereâs not with some of these guys, they are playing the wrong sport and definitely in the wrong organization. I’m sure there is, but we’ve got to find a way to win.â Pettitte could have started his response by saying the last part, âIâm sure there isâ urgency. But he didnât.  From the press box it looks as if Pettitte (10-10), pitching with every last drop of energy in his 41-year-old body, was shaming his teammates into competing harder. He threw a marvelous game, allowing only one mistake — a home run to Colby Rasmus in the fourth inning â to blemish his pitching line, and of course he beat himself up about it afterward. Pettitte, 41 or not, can still pitch. In his last eight starts he is 3-1 with a 2.02 earned run average. He attributes his recent success to rediscovering the proper arm slot, something that had been difficult during his previous eight starts, when he was 2-4 with a 5.56 E.R.A. And who knows what nagging injury he was hiding and pitching through. Pettitte has not given any indication he will come back to pitch in 2014, and people seem to think this will be it for him. That would be a shame. The Yankees need his example. He has not been great, but he has been one of the team’s better pitchers when it has mattered most. And he is definitely not in the wrong organization.
