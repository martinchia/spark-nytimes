MONTREAL â Has American menâs tennis now fallen behind Canada? Here at the Rogers Cup, the host country has begun to feel like the bully on the North American block. That new sense of self only intensified on Thursday when unseeded Vasek Pospisil of Vernon, British Columbia â Popsicle to the American broadcaster and the nickname artist Brad Gilbert â pulled off his third straight upset of the tournament. Thursdayâs 7-5, 2-6, 7-6 (5) victory over sixth-ranked Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic was the biggest career victory for Pospisil, 23, who began the week ranked No. 71. If thatâs not saying much, Canada also has the worldâs 13th-ranked player in the rising star Milos Raonic, whose 7-5, 6-4 victory Thursday night over Juan MartÃ­n del Potro was the most anticipated match of the tournament. Canada will look to place a player into the semifinals of its own tournament on Friday for the first time since 1969.  The United States, a long-dominant menâs tennis power now fallen on hard times, lost its remaining top 20 player Tuesday (for next weekâs rankings) when John Isner became Pospisilâs first victim here in three sets. He backed that up with a straight-sets elimination of No. 51 Radek Stepanek, also of the Czech Republic. Any thought that Pospisil might be in over his head against Berdych disappeared when he took the first set on the National Bank court, which is adjacent to the bigger center stadium court. By the time Pospisil coughed up a 4-3 lead and was broken in the third set, the courtâs stands were jammed, with spectators packed into the walkways as well. With each Pospisil winner or Berdych error, the crowd erupted â perhaps the sound of an upstart tennis nation announcing itself. âI think if the children here in Canada can see the Canadian players having good results, it can only be positive for tennis in Canada,â said Pospisil, who turned pro in 2007. âI really hope this will continue, and that tennis will be able to become a major sport in Canada in the future.â Thursdayâs Globe and Mail of Toronto ran an editorial about Canadaâs improving tennis fortunes, citing the countryâs Davis Cup team, which will meet the powerhouse Serbian squad in a September semifinal. If Pospisil, who plays second singles behind Raonic, continues his climb, Canada could eventually have two players for sliding American to look up to. Somewhere, John McEnroe is shaking his head and saying, âYou cannot be serious!â Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
