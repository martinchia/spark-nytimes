 Brendan Steele took a one-stroke lead in the Travelers Championship in Cromwell, Conn., by shooting an eight-under-par 62, two shy of the course record. Steele started his round with an eagle, holing out from 129 yards in the rain. He went on to birdie six of the next 12 holes. Bud Cauley and Ryan Moore shot 63, and five players followed at 64. ■ Mikko Ilonen of Finland carded a course-record seven-under 64 while Rory McIlroy finished 10 shots behind in the first round of the Irish Open in Cork.
