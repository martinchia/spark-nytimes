Advertisement  AP Pittsburgh lost its season-high fourth game in a row as Atlanta rallied late tonight behind the hitting of Terry Pendleton and won, 10-3. The first-place Pirates were coasting at 3-0 behind Paul Miller, making his major league debut, when the right-hander lost his control in the sixth inning, loading the bases with no one out. Otis Nixon opened the inning for the Braves, who had swept a doubleheader with the Pirates Monday, with a walk. Jeff Treadway got an infield single and Pendleton also walked, loading the bases and bringing on reliever Bill Landrum. Landrum (1-2) walked Ron Gant to score Nixon, and Lonnie Smith followed with a run-scoring single. Jeff Blauser then hit a sacrifice fly before Brian Hunter singled for the fourth run of the inning. The Braves then blew the game open in the seventh off Landrum, getting six hits and scoring six runs. The hits included a bunt single by Nixon, who extended his hitting streak to 19 games. Advertisement Smith and Hunter each had run-scoring hits in the two big innings; Pendleton had a walk, a run-scoring single and scored twice. Nixon stole his National League-leading 58th base of the season in the seventh, breaking the Braves' franchise record of 57 set by Ralph Myers in 1913.
