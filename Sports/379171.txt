 Quarterback Vince Young, who has not played in the N.F.L. since 2011, told NFL.com that he had retired. Young, the No. 3 overall pick in 2006 by the Tennessee Titans, was released in 2011 after a falling-out with Jeff Fisher, then the Titans’ coach. Young participated in the Cleveland Browns’ minicamp before signing with the team May 1, but the team cut him four days after drafting Johnny Manziel. A version of this brief appears in print on June 15, 2014, on Page SP2 of the New York edition with the headline: Young, Former Titans Quarterback, Retires.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
