It was hard to ignore Mark McGwire during the baseball post-season. His position at the near end of the dugout made him seem larger than life on the television. Iâm going to admit it: after seeing McGwire in uniform, working as batting coach for the soon-to-be champions, I felt a positive vibration. McGwire has admitted to using steroids during his playing career, which most of us had finally figured out. His statement that he took them only for healing but not for power was ridiculous. But for all that, I was glad to see that baseball has not found a way to ban him, retroactively, from a time when there was no testing and no penalties. Nobody has criticized McGwire more than I have, particularly for his ludicrous appearance in front of Congress in 2005. But I felt nearly as good seeing him as I did when Floyd Layne of City College of New York and Alex Groza of Kentucky came back to coach after being involved in the game-fixing basketball scandals at mid-century. That doesnât mean I would vote for McGwire (or some other bulked-up sluggers of the past generation) for the Baseball Hall of Fame, even if I did vote for awards like that. Maybe Iâm getting soft-hearted or soft-headed, but I found myself glad to see him in uniform. How did you react at seeing McGwire in the World Series?
