Advertisement By WILLIAM N. WALLACE In the blizzard of commercials throughout yesterday's television coverage of the Super Bowl, we were more or less introduced to two fellows named simply Dan and Dave by Reebok, the athletic-shoe company. In case you failed to count, there were four 15-seconds commericals and one of 30 seconds, all surrounding the third quarter of the game. These kicked off a seven-month, $30 million pre-Olympic television advertising campaign by Reebok and in case your interest was piqued, here is the proper identification: DAVE JOHNSON, from Missoula, Mont., and DAN O'BRIEN from Moscow, Idaho, are two world-class decathalon athletes whose targets are medals at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. Meanwhile, they will be the only subjects of this ad campaign. Reebok wants to make their names familiar before the Olympics, and thus has underwritten their training efforts, and of course their high-tech footgear. The United States trials in the event do not come until June and so the whole enterprise is chancy. A hamstring pull? A sprained something? But an Olympics decathlon gold-medal winner is a somebody. Either Dan or Dave might turn out to be 1992's JIM THORPE, BOB MATHIAS, BILL TOOMEY, RAFER JOHNSON or BRUCE JENNER. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
