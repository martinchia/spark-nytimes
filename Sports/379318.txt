Russiaâs remarkable gold medal at the world junior championships in Buffalo this week â three straight comeback victories, including five unanswered third-period goals to beat Canada, 5-3, before more than 18,000 fans at HSBC Arena in the tournament final Wednesday â again put the lie to all the stereotypes that are trotted out at international hockey events. Stereotypes like the notion that Canadians are hard-working players who more than make up for lack of talent with big hearts and an indomitable will to win. Or that the Russians supposedly have endless talent but are petulant, enigmatic and undependable when it matters. But in the third period of the gold-medal game, the Canadians crumbled despite the presence of a huge contingent of fans who occupied Buffalo for the tournamentâs 11 days. Instead, it was the Russians who showed indomitable heart.  They rallied late to beat Finland in the quarterfinals and Sweden in the semifinals. Each victory involved goals in which Russian players dived on their bellies during goal-mouth scrambles to shove the puck into the net. âWe simply believed in ourselves,â said Artemi Panarin, who had two goals against Canada. âThatâs why we won today, and two days ago, and three days ago.â  Russia Coach Valeri Bragin blasted his players at the first intermission after they fell behind by 2-0 to the Canadians.  âIt was a very emotional speech of our coach,â forward Maxim Kitsyn said. âHe even broke the blackboard.â
The Russians did not sulk, they responded â including Kitsyn, who scored a goal during the rally. The Russian victory party extended long after the final horn. Early the next morning, some in the delegation were so unruly that airline employees barred them from their flight at Buffaloâs airport.  Going into the tournament, Canada Coach Dave Cameron said he had a âlunch bucket,â âblue-collarâ team, prompting expressions of disbelief from those who pointed out that he had 15 first-round N.H.L. draft picks on the roster.  Late in the tournament, Canadian players pointed with pride to their refusal to look happy or sing along when their national anthem was played after victories. âItâs almost a Canadian thing,â defenseman Erik Gudbranson said before the final. âWeâve been letting it build up. We are all mumbling âO Canadaâ under our breath. Weâre staring at the crowd, staring at the flag. Weâre letting it all build up for the gold medal game. Itâs very important to keep our eye on the prize.â The Canadians seemingly lost that vision in the final.
