LUCIE, Fla. — It is a more or less unwritten rule of spring training: Established veterans are not asked to make too many two-hour bus rides across Florida to play in spring training games. There will be plenty of travel once the regular season begins.  But this weekend, instead of busing around Florida, the Mets will fly to Las Vegas to play two games against the Chicago Cubs as part of the annual Big League Weekend there. Four of the Mets’ leading figures will be on the trip: General Manager Sandy Alderson, Manager Terry Collins, third baseman David Wright and outfielder Curtis Granderson. And the trip will take a lot longer than one of those unwanted bus rides. It is, in a sense, a good-will excursion meant to strengthen the Mets’ relationship with their Class AAA affiliate, the Las Vegas 51s. The Mets hope to stir up some local excitement — which might not be easy in a city dominated by casinos — by having Wright and Granderson play some innings and enabling Alderson and Collins to shake some hands.  Alderson said the Mets “haven’t had to twist any arms” to get players to agree to go.  Collins had held Wright, and Daniel Murphy, out of the initial spring training games in an effort to keep them healthy and rested. Wright appreciated the opportunity to apply himself fully to the batting cage, workout sessions and infield drills without worrying about games.  The trip to Las Vegas will disrupt his routine somewhat, but Wright said he was looking forward to a diversion. He also wanted to see the Class AAA facilities in Las Vegas, where many of the Mets’ best young prospects — in particular, Noah Syndergaard and Rafael Montero — are expected to to start the season.  “They told me to go, so I’m gonna go,” Wright said, smiling.
