Advertisement  AP The National Collegiate Athletic Association, over objections from its top enforcement officers, has changed a long-standing policy and directed that all investigators move to tape their interviews. Witnesses will be given access to the tapes but are not allowed to make their own recordings. They can decline to be taped. The infractions committee, which oversees the N.C.A.A.'s enforcement staff in Overland Park and decides cases, decreed last April that taping, which insures accuracy, should be tried on an experimental basis. The enforcement division had argued that the recordings would compromise confidentiality. "We didn't suggest that they start taping their interviews with witnesses," said Alan Williams, chairman of the infractions committee. "We directed it." A special committee that includes former Chief Justice Warren Burger will begin examining the N.C.A.A.'s enforcement policies at hearings next month and could sponsor new enforcement legislation that member schools would vote on next January.
