Advertisement  The Jets waived veteran place-kicker Raul Allegre yesterday, giving the starting job to Jason Staurovsky, a Plan B free agent who was with the New England Patriots for te previous four seasons. In the 1992 preseason, Allegre, recognized as one of the best clutch field-goal kickers in the National Football League, made 2 of 5 attempts. He missed a 47-yarder against the Eagles in the Jets' final exhibition game on Thursday night in Philadelphia. Staurovsky, who at 29 is 4 years younger than Allegre, made 5 of 5 preseason attempts. Frank Ramos, a Jets spokesman, said Allegre spoke with General Manager Dick Steinberg, then left camp for Austin, Tex., where he lives. Allegre, who reached the N.F.L. with the Baltimore Colts in 1983 and played parts of six seasons with theGiants before joining the Jets late last season, said last week that he would probably give his pro career if he were cut and continue work on a master's degree in business administration at the University of Texas. "It was a close call and a tough decision, but we decided to go with Jason," Steinberg said in a written statement. "He did everything we asked of hime during training camp and in the preseason games." Pat Leahy, an 18-year veteran who retired before the start of training camp, cleared the way for the competition between Allegre and Staurovsky. Last December, Allegre joined the Jets forthe team's final 1991 game, after Leahy was striken with sciatica. In the playoff clinching victory over Miami, Allegre kicked a 44-yard field goal to send the game into overtime and kicked a 30-yarder that won it.
