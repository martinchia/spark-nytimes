Dave Rock takes down Animal Kingdomâs bridle and wets a blue tongue tie in a red bucket. Two stalls down in the Preakness Barn, Graham Motion talks to Shared Account. Matias Ramirez puts on a tie. Bob Baffert comes by with a good luck. Security officers mobilize, and check their mutuel tickets. An NBC producer makes a â5 minutes!â announcement.
