Advertisement Supported by By The New York Times Carmelo Anthony and Jeremy Lin never exactly clicked as teammates on the Knicks. When Linsanity erupted out of nowhere in early 2012, with Lin repeatedly leading the Knicks to victories, Anthony was on the sideline, injured and not looking especially pleased to see someone else becoming the focal point of New York basketball. When Anthony returned to action, he and Lin did not necessarily work in tandem on the court. Lin then departed in the summer of 2012 for a three-year, $25 million free-agent deal with the Houston Rockets, and Anthony was quoted as saying the contract was “ridiculous.” All of this loomed in the background on Wednesday when Anthony visited the Rockets as part of a free-agency tour that has already taken him to Chicago to check in with the Bulls. It is also expected to include stops in Dallas, where Anthony will be wooed by the Mavericks, and Los Angeles, where the Lakers are suitors.  To welcome Anthony, the Rockets posted images on a marquee outside Toyota Center, their arena, that showed him wearing Houston jerseys bearing No. 7, his number in New York. The problem is that it is also Lin’s number with the Rockets.  It should be noted that Houston would almost certainly have to deal Lin, now a backup, to make room for Anthony’s contract, so it is unlikely they would ever be fellow Rockets. Lin reacted to the video image by citing a biblical verse about turning the other cheek.     Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
