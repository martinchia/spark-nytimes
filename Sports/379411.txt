Brazil won the FIFA Under-20 World Cup for the fifth time on Saturday night, beating Portugal, 3-2, in extra time in Bogota, Colombia. Oscar, 19-year-old midfielder who plays for Internacional in Brazil (for now), scored a hat trick in the final. His winner came in the 111th minute, on a lobbed shot from the right wing that went in over the fingertips of Portugal’s goalkeeper, Mika. Oscar’s three goals were the only ones Portugal allowed in the tournament, but the winner and Oscar’s first, a 40-yard straight-on free kick that appeared to glance in off the head of a Portuguese defender in the fifth minute, will be especially hard for the losing side to stomach.

Saturday’s game was a rematch of the 1991 final won by Portugal, though only a handful of the players from Brazil and Portugal who appeared in this year’s tournament had been born then. That year’s Portuguese squad included the core of what came to be known as that country’s Golden Generation, though its achievements on the senior level never matched its age-group successes.  That said, the under-20 tournament has traditionally been a better predictor of future success than the under-17 event; recent Golden Ball winners include Manchester City’s Sergio AgÃ¼ero (2007) and Barcelona’s Lionel Messi (2005). Going back a decade to the 2001 event in Argentina, the rosters read like a who’s who: Ghana’s Michael Essien, Argentina’s Javier Saviola, Brazil’s KakÃ¡, Arjen Robben of the Netherlands and a promising American, Landon Donovan. Mexico is one team hoping that its play this year portends a bright future. The Mexicans, knocked into this year’s third-place game by the Brazilians on Wednesday, got a small bit of consolation by beating France, 3-1. Mexico’s showing capped a strong summer for its federation, which earlier saw its senior team win the Gold Cup and its under-17 team capture that world title. Mexico’s next goal will be to qualify for next summer’s London Olympics; that tournament, for under-23 teams, will be held in the United States (the site, or sites, are still T.B.A.) in March. The three automatic qualifiers — Mexico, the United States and Canada — will be joined by five other qualifiers to compete for Concacaf’s two spots in the Olympic tournament.
