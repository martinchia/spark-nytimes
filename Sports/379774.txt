The Kentucky Derby continues to vex the Hall of Fame trainer Bill Mott, whose To Honor and Serve has a strained a suspensory ligament in his left foreleg and is off the Derby trail. “It is called a proximal suspensory lesion,” Mott wrote in an e-mail. “Very small area at the attachment on top. Generally heal well in a short period of time. Can often be kept in light training after a two- or three-week rest.” The son of Bernardini, To Honor and Serve captured the Remsen Stakes last year at a mile and an eighth, raising Mottâs expectations that he finally had a colt bred for the classic Triple Crown distances.  To Honor and Serve was coming off a pair of third-place finishes, most recently in the Florida Derby. Earlier this week, however, Mott noticed the colt was off in his stride. Ultrasound confirmed the strain, and To Honor and Serve will be taken out of training. Mott has entered only seven horses in the Derby since 1984, and Favorite Trickâs eighth-place finish in 1998 is his best finish.
