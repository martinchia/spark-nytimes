Tampa Bay forward Martin St. Louis missed what would have been his 500th consecutive regular-season game Thursday, a streak that ended after he took a puck to the eye and sustained facial and nasal fractures during the morning skate at Madison Square Garden. St. Louis, 36, is considered one of hockeyâs best players and one of its most durable, despite being only 5 feet 7 inches. He was crossing behind the net when he was struck by a wayward backhand shot from his teammate Dominic Moore. The Lightning announced via Twitter just before the game that St. Louis is out indefinitely and would return to Florida for further examination by the Lightningâs team physicians when the swelling subsides. St. Louis will be held overnight at New York University Medical Center, according to team officials, but General Manager Steve Yzerman said there was no damage to St. Louis’s eye. “We don’t believe any surgery is necessary,” Yzerman said. “It could have been worse.” St. Louis is the 12th leading scorer among active N.H.L. players. His 800th career point came in his last game, Tuesdayâs 5-1 loss to the Islanders. He won the Hart Trophy and the Conn Smythe Trophy in 2004, when the Lightning, coached by John Tortorella, won the Stanley Cup. St. Louisâs streak â third among active players behind Calgaryâs Jay Bouwmeester (531) and Vancouverâs Henrik Sedin (526) â would have been even longer if not for a broken finger that cost him two games in the 2005-6 season. Until Thursday, St. Louis appeared in 749 of 751 regular-season and playoff games since the 2001-2 season, playing through injuries as gruesome as a gash between the eyes from a skate blade, a big toe that needed to be drained of excess blood and a serious case of food poisoning. Thursday night, St. Louis was absent from a pregame skate for the first time since Nov. 15, 2005. But the equipment manager Ray Thill put St. Louis’s sticks in the rack at the Lightning bench anyway.
