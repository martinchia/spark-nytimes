CLEVELAND â Derek Jeter and Joe Girardi spoke sometime around 11:30 p.m. Tuesday in the visiting managerâs office at Progressive Field, and their conversation spilled over into a series of late-night text messages. Jeter tried to change his mind, lobbying Girardi to play Wednesday night against the Indians, convincing him that he did not need a rest. Having determined that Jeter would receive one of the next five games off before the All-Star break, Girardi wanted time to think. He spoke to the head trainer Gene Monahan, who assured Girardi that Jeter was healthy, then told Jeter that he would sleep on the decision. A few hours later, he awoke with a different perspective. âI got a sense that heâs thinking about it and he wants to get this done with so he can go on and be Derek Jeter,â Girardi said. âNot Derek Jeter pursuing 3,000 hits.â At 2,996 after going 2 for 6 Tuesday, Jeter started and batted leadoff Wednesday, something he will do every game until he reaches the milestone, however long it takes. It occurred to Girardi that sitting Jeter on Wednesday would increase the pressure on him to get the four remaining hits this weekend at Yankee Stadium, where the Yankees open a four-game series Thursday against Tampa Bay. After the All-Star break, they embark on an eight-game trip, and Girardi wanted to give Jeter every opportunity to notch No. 3,000 as soon as possible. âI would love to see it get done over this weekend, and if thatâs what we have to do, thatâs what we have to do,â said Girardi, who solicited input from General Manager Brian Cashman. âThe one thing in thinking about this overnight and this morning, what I realized is none of us know what itâs like to be close to 3,000 hits, we donât know whatâs going through his mind. I just started thinking, you know, maybe itâs a lot worse, in a sense, if youâre sitting around thinking about it.â
 To borrow a phrase from Jeter, it is not as if he sits around thinking about it. But it is very much a part of him now, as more members of the national news media have arrived every day, asking him dozens of questions about the chase. He accommodates them all, looking reporters in the eye, but during a seven-and-a-half-minute interview Wednesday, he came across as detached. âI always want to play,â Jeter said. âThat doesnât change. Thatâs always been the case. When you miss that much time, you want to play games and get back into a routine.â He added, âIf I had 500, hits, Iâd still be wanting to play.â Jeter has recorded at least four hits in a game 37 previous times, and has had success against Clevelandâs starter Wednesday, the right-hander Justin Masterson, going 5 for 12 off him. He betrayed no signs of the pursuit weighing on him, though Girardi sprinkled his thoughtful responses with phrases like âget this out of the wayâ or âget over withâ and âget through it,â as if it has become a burden instead of a celebration of a superb career. When asked whether he would rather hit No. 3,000 at home or on the road, Jeter played coy. âWhen I said I wanted to do it at home, thatâs when we were at home,â Jeter said. âIf I say that I want to do it at home now, is that saying I donât want to get a hit every time up, you know what I mean? Really. I take it at-bat to at-bat and try to do your job every at-bat, and that doesnât change.â The Yankees would prefer it happens at Yankee Stadium, and they might have some control over the situation. Girardi said he would have to consider pulling Jeter if he had three hits Wednesday night and the Yankees were winning. âIâm going to manage to win the game, thatâs the bottom line,â Girardi said. âI would love for him to be 3 for 3 and we have a big lead. But I donât know what I would do. I hope I would get in that situation, that heâs 3 for 3 and we have a big lead. That would be nice.â INSIDE PITCH Mariano Rivera said that âit wouldnât be the worstâ to sit out a third consecutive game Wednesday with a sore right triceps, but that he would âdefinitelyâ be available to pitch Thursday night against the Rays.
