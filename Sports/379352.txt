SANDWICH, ENGLAND â An amateur who shoots a 65 in his first British Open round, makes the cut with ease and draws praise from none other than Tom Watson should be a lock for the silver medal awarded to the tournamentâs leading amateur. Not so fast. Tom Lewis, the 20-year-old Englishman in question, followed up that 65 with a 74 and a 76, and he is now just two shots in front of the American Peter Uihlein, the only other amateur still in the tournament. Lewis is at five-over par with one round to play; Uihlein, the reigning United States amateur champion, is at seven over after following two 71s with a third-round 75 to sit tied for 41st.  Uihlein, like Lewis, has strong family connections to golf. Lewisâs father is a golf professional. Uihleinâs father, Wally, is the chairman and chief executive of the Acushnet Company, which includes the golf brands Titleist and FootJoy. âWell, Peter is a great player, so no matter what happens tomorrow, hopefully I can play well, and if I donât win, then I donât win,â Lewis said. âHe deserves whatever he gets. Hopefully I can win some bigger trophies in my career.â

Uihlein, a 21-year-old all-American golfer from Oklahoma State, missed the cut at the Masters and the United States Open this year, but he is playing on the weekend at this major.  The conversation has shifted quickly here at Royal St. Georgeâs. On Thursday, it seemed like the early results were confirmation of Europeâs increased domination of the game and Lewisâs glittering 65 a big hint that the good times would keep right on rolling. But the Americans have struck back and now have 10 players in the top 16 heading into Sunday, and Uihlein now has a chance to snatch the silver medal for the United States, too.
