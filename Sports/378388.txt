After nearly a decade of uninterrupted winning, it was time for a new challenge for Esther Vergeer. Vergeer, a Dutch wheelchair tennis champion who had won 470 consecutive matches, announced her retirement from competition in February. The announcement, at the ATP tournament in Rotterdam, coincided with the release of her autobiography. Seven months into her retirement, Vergeer is still gaining steadiness in her new role, as an ambassador of sorts for wheelchair tennis off the court rather than the sport’s ruthless ruler on it. In New York for the United States Open, Vergeer met with representatives of the International Tennis Federation and the Grand Slams to discuss better integration and promotion of the wheelchair game, including larger draws and more prize money.  At the United States Open, the wheelchair draws consisted of only eight players, compared with 128 in the main draws. Aside from concerns at the top levels of the sport, Vergeer was also interested in promoting the game in developing countries. “How can we get more people involved in wheelchair tennis?” she said. “Doing clinics, is that the right way? Is it media we have to work on? There’s a lot of things we’re having good discussions on.” She added: “Hopefully more tournaments will see the added value of wheelchair tennis if they have that at their tournaments. So that will be good. The level will still grow, and if you get that attention from a lot of people, spectators, it will be good for the game.” Vergeer said she was feeling more comfortable in Flushing Meadows than at the first tournament she visited after retirement, the French Open. “That was my first tournament, so that was really weird,” she said. “And here it’s not that weird because I found myself a better position of who I am, what role I’m in. And also the players and organization know better what role I have. So it’s a little less uncomfortable, but still a little awkward, of course.” Vergeer says her return to the locker room in New York drew some confusion from the legion of players she spent years keeping from the top of the podium. “One player, the first question she asked, ‘What are you doing here?’ ” Vergeer recalled. “I’m not playing anymore, what would I do here? I don’t have anything to do in this tournament, why would I spend the money to come to New York, to watch tennis â wheelchair tennis? So now I’m explaining more, and they see what I’m trying to do in the other part of wheelchair tennis. They kind of understand better.” Vergeer believes the other players are happy to see her name no longer listed in competitions, since it means the outcome of tournaments is now more in doubt. “I think the players really like it that the competition between the No. 1, 2, 3 and 4, maybe 5 and 6 as well, is so much harder,” she said. “So now every time they come to a tournament, it’s not sure who is going to win, and who is going to be in the final, and who is competing against each other. And that’s good, that’s what sport is about. So you see that they really enjoy that part.” While other players are likely happy to see her on the sideline, Vergeer admits that transitioning to a role as an advocate was not initially easy for her. “I wouldn’t say it’s natural,” she said. “Especially because I was a player before, that suits me the best, that role. So I have to learn, and I have to adjust, and I have to find a way to still feel comfortable, but also to have a little bit of an influence with my experience in the game. So it’s not natural. I mean, I like it. I like to learn the more politics side of the game, yeah.” While she said she does not believe she would make a good coach at the professional level, she is focused on introducing more young disabled people to sports. “What I really enjoy is to have kids with talent â or just kids in general with disabilities â getting involved with sports,” she said. “So with my foundation, I’m getting the grass roots, the really recreational kids involved in sports. But I’m also thinking about the role that I really would like is kids, young adults, 12-, 13-, 14-year-olds that are maybe going to go to the Paralympics, but still need that adjustment in their heads to help them develop as a person, and as an athlete.” Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
