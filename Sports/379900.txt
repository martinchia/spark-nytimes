 Daniel Brooks made par on the first playoff hole Sunday to win the fog-shortened Madeira Islands Open, which was overshadowed by the death of a caddie earlier in the day. Some European Tour members said the tournament should have been stopped after Ian MacGregor, the 52-year-old Zimbabwe-born caddie to Scotland’s Alastair Forsyth, collapsed and died, apparently of a heart attack, on the ninth fairway, Forsyth’s final hole. The event, which had already been shortened to 36 holes because of fog delays, was halted again after the delay but restarted following a minute’s silence. “Can’t believe they are going to keep playing in Madeira,” Pablo Larrazabal, who was not in the tournament, wrote on Twitter. However, European Tour officials said they had consulted with players and caddies before deciding to play on. Forsyth said it was the right decision. “I felt that was what Mac would have wanted,” Forsyth said. Brooks shot a five-under-par 67 to sit tied with Scott Henry (68) at nine-under 135 after the second and final round at Santo da Serra. Henry three-putted for bogey on the first playoff hole. A version of this brief appears in print on May 12, 2014, on Page D10 of the New York edition with the headline: Caddie Dies on Fairway.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
