8:35 p.m. | Updated BOSTON â Jesus Montero made his long-awaited major league debut Thursday night, and what better site than Fenway Park, with his parents and girlfriend watching from the stands. It did not take long for Montero, the Yankeesâ designated hitter, to step into the batterâs box and feel the pressure of playing in a Yankees-Red Sox series. A moment to remember, however, did not turn out the way Montero wanted. He struck out with the bases loaded against Jon Lester to end the first inning. âI felt like I am dreaming, like somebody punched me in the face or something like that,â Montero said before the game. âThis is amazing for me, a great night for me tonight. I hope I do everything really good and help them win tonight. Iâm here to have fund and help them win.â Montero, an elite prospect, was the most intriguing of the five call-ups from the minors Thursday. âWeâre hoping he can give us some lightning in a bottle,â Manager Joe Girardi said. Girardi said he wanted to see Montero catch at some point but could not predict when that would happen. Before the game, Montero settled for catching Freddy Garciaâs bullpen session.  Girardi said he recently watched video of Montero catching in the minors, and came away pleased with his progress, although some scouts do not believe he can be a major-league-caliber catcher. Few, though, have ever doubted his skills as a hitter. A career .308 hitter in five minor league seasons, Montero batted .288 for Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre this season. He had 18 home runs and 67 runs batted in 420 at-bats, with an .814 on-base plus slugging percentage. âHe just has a way of getting the barrel to the ball,â Girardi said. âHe has the ability to hit for power and hit for average, to be a run producer. I havenât seen a ton of him, and we didnât really see a great Jesus Montero this spring. Everybody talks about his ability to hit, and itâs really there.â After being invited to spring training, Montero had a chance to win the backup job behind Russell Martin. But he struggled under the pressure, Girardi said, and the Yankees felt it was better for him to continue his development by playing every day in the minors rather than twice a week with the major league club. Montero, a 21-year-old right-handed hitter from Guacara, Venezuela, did not dispute that he was a little overwhelmed in spring training. âI felt a little pressure because I wanted to be with the Yankees,â he acknowledged. Monteroâs arrival means less playing time for Jorge Posada, Eric Chavez and Andruw Jones at designated hitter, which is something Girardi will have to handle delicately. He noted that the remaining at-bats at designated hitter could be further reduced for those players because Alex Rodriguez, Derek Jeter and even Robinson Cano and Mark Teixeira might player there as well. âThatâs something Iâve got to manage,â Girardi said. âItâs part of the job.â In addition to Montero, the Yankees also called up the right-handed pitchers Scott Proctor and Lance Pendleton, the left-handed reliever Raul Valdes, infielder Brandon Laird and outfielder Chris Dickerson. INSIDE PITCH Alex Rodriguez, who is recovering from a sprained left thumb, was due to take batting practice Thursday for the first time since he aggravated the injury on Sunday. He also continued to take infield practice. The Yankees are hopeful that Rodriguez can play Friday against the Toronto Blue Jays at Yankee Stadium. … As of Thursday afternoon, the Yankees had not announced the starting pitchers for games after Saturday. C. C. Sabathia, who threw 128 pitches on Tuesday, might benefit from an extra day off. If so, he would pitch Monday and Freddy Garcia would pitch Sunday against Toronto. If Sabathia does not require an extra day, they would flip days.
