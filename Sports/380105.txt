Pioline, seeded third, was playing his second match since losing to Pete Sampras four days ago in the final at Flushing Meadows. "I still am living in another time zone; for me, it's morning now," Pioline said after losing to the 20-year-old Italian. "Besides, Gaudenzi is a very good clay player, and I last played on clay three months ago."
