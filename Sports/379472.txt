Coco Vandeweghe, the promising 19-year-old American who chose tennis over basketball, said she prefers to progress in a consistent rather than streaky manner. After losing in her second-round match against the steadier and more experienced Samantha Stosur, she will have to wait another year to try to reach the third round. During Wednesday’s afternoon match in Louis Armstrong stadium, Vandeweghe showed at times why many consider her an heir-apparent to the Williams sisters. At one point, Vandeweghe had a 10 to nothing ace advantage over last yearâs French Open finalist. But, as many young players discover, it isnât the flashy shots or one big weapon that wins matches at the championship level.  Despite the aces, Vandeweghe, the granddaughter of the former New York Knick Ernie Vandeweghe, struggled to hold her serves, and didnât make much of a dent in the ninth-seeded Stosurâs service games â a dynamic she knows she has to flip against the gameâs better players.  Vandeweghe, who was born in New York City and now lives in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., said she was happy to reach the second round at the U.S. Open for the first time, but added, âI still have miles to go in every area.â âI have my goals and when I reach those goals, Iâll be elated,â she said. Currently ranked 112 in the world, she hopes to break the top 70 by the end of the year. When the baseline rallies werenât going her way, Vandeweghe pushed forward, only to watch helplessly as Stosur slapped the ball past her.  For the match, Vandeweghe was just 7 of 17 at the net. Stosur, a former doubles No. 1, was 7 of 9 at the net. Vandeweghe’s best point point of the match ended with a forehand passing shot that tunneled between Stosurâs body and her racket (not an easy thing to do against a championship doubles player). With that, she broke back in the second set to even it at 3-3. Vandeweghe played with great confidence in the next game, hitting a big serve out wide, followed by forehand crosscourt winner. She held for a temporary second set lead, 4-3. But Stosur, 27, held easily. During the most critical service game in the second set, Vandeweghe hit an ace only to double fault on the next point. A big second serve pushed her to 40-30 but a mishandled backhand evened it at deuce. On game point, she tried move forward but Stosur ripped a crosscourt passer on the run. On break point, Vandeweghe fired a gutsy ace up the T. But, after several deuces, Stosurâs steady play prevailed, and she broke for an opportunity to serve for the match. In the final game, Vandeweghe battled to deuce but Stosur crouched for a beautiful backhand winner down the line and won it, 6-3, 6-4. âI fought my heart out out there,â Vandeweghe said, âand thatâs all I can ask for.â Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court.
