The New York Times covered the Winter Olympics opening ceremony from inside of Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi — live as it happened, not on tape delay. The parade of nations, the athletes’ oath, some less-than-electrifying speeches by dignitaries, we had it all — right up through the lighting of the Olympic caldron by the figure skater Irina Rodnina and the hockey player Vladislav Tretiak. 



2:12 P.M. Torchbearer
 What a night! We have seen some ballet, heard some opera, learned some things about the Russian alphabet and taken a whirlwind tour of Russian history that included references to Peter the Great, the cosmonauts, âWar and Peaceâ and industrial production. But â understandably, under the circumstances â other things were left out, like the gulag and the way Putinâs rivals tend to get sentenced to prison in Siberia. We have seen three giant animal mascots skating around the arena. We have watched a performance by the erstwhile popular female duo t.A.T.u. (and I hope I never have to type that ridiculously capitalized word ever again) and seen some former Olympic athletes jogging around with the torch. We have heard the I.O.C. president, Thomas Bach, make a plea for tolerance and inclusiveness, but also ask countries to keep politics out of the Games and to resolve their differences through peaceful debate. We have grown progressively more frozen. We have cheered for the Jamaican bobsled team, as we always do, and marveled at just how many clashing images the American delegation managed to cram onto their official team jackets. And now we are winding down for the evening. But our team will be bringing you full coverage for the next 16 days. See you at the luge track! — SARAH LYALL It’s time for what is often the most thrilling moment of the ceremony. The lighting of the Olympic caldron. The first torchbearer to enter the stadium is the tennis star Maria Sharapova. No discrimination against Summer Olympics athletes, then. In Russia, apparently you pronounce it SHA-RA-pava. I always thought it was SHARE-A-POE-va. Either way, she’s here, seems to be doing well. â Sam Dolnick (@samdolnick) 7 Feb 14 She hands the torch to the top pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva.  Next up is one of the most dominant athletes of all time, the great heavyweight Greco-Roman wrestler Aleksandr Karelin. Torch-bearer No. 4 is the rhythmic gymnast Alina Kabaeva, the 2004 all-around gold medalist who is now a member of parliament. Kabaeva has also, well, been long rumored to be Vladimir V. Putin’s girlfriend.  And now the moment has arrived. There will be two final torchbearers. Irina Rodnina, the pairs skater who won gold in 1972, ’76 and ’80, and Vladislav Tretiak, one of the great hockey goalies and another three-time gold medal winner (though the Americans beat his team in 1980).  The caldron is outside, so the two jog out of the stadium, quite some distance. There, they light a mini-caldron, the flame shoots up a huge pillar to the main caldron and it ignites. One of the better Winter Olympic ceremonies: visually striking, creative, not too parochial and the cauldron is in the right spot. â Christopher Clarey (@christophclarey) 7 Feb 14 Let the Games begin! — VICTOR MATHER A promotional image of the Sochi Olympics â ski goggles reflecting palm trees â came alive Friday in downtown Sochi.  A boisterous crowd â a few hundred at first, and then thousands — streamed through the palm-lined streets to an outdoor area for watching the opening on a huge screen, set up beside the city port. People arrived pushing baby carriages and hoisting children onto their shoulders in a buoyant mood, ready for a party, and apparently brushing away worries about terrorism. Gripes of the hassle of all the construction also seemed to have fallen aside for the opening party.  A line of men stood outside a convenience store, waiting for bottles of cognac and beer to toast their cityâs big day in the open air. This being Russia, a ban on smoking in outdoor areas during the Olympics was summarily and cheerily ignored by many.  The city is a climatic outlier in Russia, situated on the countryâs only, tiny sliver of subtropical coast beside mountains.  A motto of the Games is âHot. Cool. Yours.â  This city of about 300,000 people, though, is very nearly only a nominal host of the Games. The distance of the city center to the ski runs is 37 miles.   Through the afternoon, streets were repeatedly blocked, but nobody seemed to mind. One man hoisted his son on his shoulders and stood on the roadside, waiting, he said, to see the presidential motorcade. A clutch of teachers from a city school stood giddy and joking, waiting for the opening ceremony to begin at the outdoor viewing area, called Live Site Sochi, where the games will be streamed live. âThe Olympics are here and I feel it,â Yelena Tunina, a teacher, said. âWe put up with a lot of inconveniences, but now everything is beautiful.â Some in the crowd said they had tickets and were ready to watch some serious sports. Teachers got them free, through work, even to coveted events like pairs figure skating. Others said they would watch at home, or show up at the outdoor viewing area. It was a cool but velvety evening, with a gentle wind in the cypress trees.  Hats came off â though most of the police in the viewing area retained theirs â and Russian flags waved when the countryâs anthem played. Some watched with mesmerized gazes at the opening act, a stylized run through Russian history, a thousand years of hardship in laser beams and light shows. Mostly, it was a night for Russians in Sochi to celebrate. — ANDREW E. KRAMER Now this is strange. For the “Dance of Peace,” we hear Tchaikovsky’s “Swan Lake,” but instead of scenes from the great Russian ballet, we get a bunch of women spinning with long glow-in-the-dark strings attached to their heads so that they look not like swans but like jellyfish. At their center is the great Russian ballerina Diana Vishneva, not doing ballet. The whole thing is taken from one of her one-woman shows, a number choreographed by the tacky American modern dance choreographer Moses Pendleton. It’s a curious international exposure of questionable Russian taste.  — BRIAN SEIBERT The I.O.C. president, Thomas Bach, delivers a sharp but nuanced speech in which he emphasizes that the Olympics are about tolerance, not discrimination â this is clearly a reference to the antigay turn Russia has taken â but also exhorts politicians around the world to âhave the courage to address your disagreements in a peaceful, direct political dialogue and not on the backs of these athletes.â Continuing an evening of admirable restraint, President Putin declares the Games open, but performs no feats of physical strength.  Thomas Bach seems a man of action, eager to make use of his bully pulpit. Could be a very interesting first year in office #sochi â Christopher Clarey (@christophclarey) 7 Feb 14 — SARAH LYALL Russia has arrived at last at the modern age. Kids jitterbug, skyscrapers rise,  cars and motorcycles cruise by, cosmonauts blast into orbit, and the Russian baby boom is depicted with dozens of dancers in wedding outfits followed by red baby carriages. It’s a celebratory climax but segues into a quiet moment when a little girl, who has been seen at various times throughout the show, floats up to the sky beneath a red balloon.   — VICTOR MATHER One of our readers asked for a photo of the LED device that we were all asked to wear. Here it is. Not much clarity because it’s dark in here. It fits in the palm of your hand and is like a medal with a neck strap. An inscription reads: “Participant of 2014 Olympics Winter Games Ceremonies.” It is activated as a wireless device (there is a tiny infrared bulb on the front of it). It flickers red, white, blue and other colors at different moments. It is white plastic on front and grey on back. And the announcer was right: this doesn’t seem likely to decompose for a millennium. — KEN BELSON We were wondering how the people who wrote the history segment would handle the pesky existence of Stalin, and we have our answer: they have disappeared him! He is like one of those out-of-favor leaders they erased from the official photograph. So, we have jumped from the revolution to … midcentury âreconstruction,â a time when âhope and progress permeate a Soviet cityscape,â with workers synchronizing their machines, policemen and âyoung pioneersâ playing the drums and bugles â- it is unclear why -â and cosmonauts are âcarrying a large rocket.â Apparently this represents âa day in the life of a Soviet metropolis.â Perhaps one imagined by Baz Luhrmann, if he had been spending a lot of time in the medical-marijuana section of his local bakery. It is very busy and very, to use everybodyâs favorite word, awesome.  Before we got to the revolution, Brian Seibert, The Times’s dance critic, enjoyed the performance: “Now Russia shows off its ballet with Svetlana Zakharova playing Natasha at the ball in Tolstoy’s “War and Peace.” The cast is enormous and swirling, and Zakharova is lovely, doing not much, being lifted overhead. But Ivan Vasiliev’s extraordinary jumps, the closest that ballet gets to sport, make a quick and powerful impression. Next up, the Russian Revolution!” — SARAH LYALL From Peter the Great to “War and Peace.” It just doesn’t stop. A ballet corps of 100-plus enacts an imperial ball from the novel, and Sarah points out that no one throws acid in anyone’s face. However the war portion of the book is represented by a sudden firing of muskets. Then the ball resumes.  War, peace, war, peace. The cycle goes on and on. The ballet gets a good reception from the audience. How to transition from the high-culture of Russian ballet to the next topic, the, er, Russian Revolution? The music becomes dissonant, the dancers’ moves become more jarring, and … all-purpose Russian metaphor alert … more snow falls! Rather than focus on the, shall we say, more blunt elements of the revolution, we’re seeing some of its more benign byproducts. A huge train flies above the stage, symbolizing the industrial revolution, and colors and shapes signify, we’re told, the avant-garde movement in art.   I mean let’s put it this way, in 1984 in Los Angeles when they performed a big cowboy bit, there wasn’t a whole lot in there about exploitation of Native Americans. — VICTOR MATHER Now I loved the celebration of Russian architecture. The swirly onion domes and the bouncing dancers were gorgeous. But did the the giant arm-waving creatures feel familiar? They’re the guys that wave outside of used car lots, their bodies inflated by the wind. Remember them? They’re everywhere on American highways. Who said Russia and the United States were so different? Our Mr. Segal wonders “if the guy responsible for the Olympic ring that didn’t open has already fled the country. Wouldn’t be a bad idea.” While our other David, Mr. Herzsenhorn, points out that “some of the darkest moments in Soviet/Russian history from the 20th century are now getting a breeze-over with an artistic focus instead on industrialization and avant-garde.”  — SAM DOLNICK The best classical-music moment so far might have been a pretty quiet one: Vanessa-Mae, the glamorous violinist of Thai-Chinese ancestry, walking in with the Thailand delegation. Turns out she was selected to compete in Alpine ski events. Watch those hands, maâam. But the whole ceremony has been classical-heavy. Tchaikovsky kicked if off as part of the alphabetical rundown of Russian culture. (He was gay, by the by.) And the day after the Metropolitan Opera in New York opened a new production of Borodinâs âPrince Igor,â the live action got underway with a chant-heavy arrangement of that operaâs famous “Polovtsian Dances.” The BBC said that there were 500 singers on the ground for the choruses, dressed in white traditional costumes embroidered with gold. This ballroom scene is inspired by the famous scene in War & Peace. Very elegant, even with the faux marble. â Sam Dolnick (@samdolnick) 7 Feb 14 Just after the athletesâ parade was a spectacle Stravinsky would never have imagined his âRite of Springâ chugging away as a troika of 60-meter horses made of light pulled the sun. Which led to a swarming village of onion-dome buildings, of course. Not exactly the balletâs story of a virgin sacrifice, but there you go. — ZACHARY WOOLFE The three mascots of the Games, a polar bear, a hare and a leopard, come on. But they’re not just some teenagers in cheap costumes. They are 50 or so feet tall, move around on skates and snowboards, and wink and gesture convincingly.  A three-minute film collage of Russian history is shown to distract us from the silent arrival of balloon versions of classic Russian-style architectural domes.  It’s time for our history lesson. A glowing white troika, or three-horse carriage, flies in. More ersatz snow is falling, some of it on your correspondent. (Snow is a pretty good all-purpose metaphor for any Russian theme.) The onion domes and costumed performers take the shape of a whale on the floor for some reason. The media notes helpfully inform us that “the audience is seeing an interpretation of the medieval period ruled by the boyars.”  O.K., then.   The domes rise to form the famous outline of St. Basil’s Cathedral. Again I must refer to the notes: “The sleeping giant of Russia is awakened, ready for change and growth.” — VICTOR MATHER We’re now watching a video that seems like a mix of “The Ten Commandments” and “300.”  Oh wait, now it’s a telecom commercial.  Ken Belson notices that “the news media seated at one end of the stadium are directly next to a large swath of fans who appear to cheer for each country with the same enthusiasm, waving their arms and yelling as if they were born there. They do not get nearly as worked up when a country goes the other way around the stadium. One wonders whether their enthusiasm is based on their being in the path of the television cameras.” — DAVID SEGAL Some stray observations about the athletes’ parade: Many of the athletes are taking selfies as they come in. We have heard a lot of repetitive music. And President Putin, in the stands, has somehow managed to keep his shirt on.  OPENING CEREMONY!!!! #GBSelfie //t.co/QQKRIJ0oUj â Nicholas Buckland (@N_Buckland) 7 Feb 14 — SARAH LYALL By tradition, the host country enters last, and as you might expect there is a  rousing response for Russia. Vladimir Putin looks on from the crowd with a kind of stern pride. A word about President Putin: disappointingly, he is still weariing his shirt. â Sarah Lyall  (@sarahlyall) 7 Feb 14 Runners-up for crowd noise were neighbors Belarus and Ukraine, and the impossible-to-dislike Jamaican bobsled team.  David Segal muses about how the Russian team entered to “We Will Rock You” beat. “By Queen. Vocals by Freddy Mercury. Layered with ”They’re Going to Get Us” by t.A.T.u., the girl pop group that pitches itself as a lesbian couple. Go figure.” Russia team enters to thunderous applause — and Queen’s We Will Rock You. I wont tell them about Freddie Mercury if you wont. â Sam Dolnick (@samdolnick) 7 Feb 14 Next up on the program: The history of Russia! — VICTOR MATHER The Russian flag that was raised over the main podium has been waving as if a 20 mile-an-hour wind is blowing. We’re indoors, which means they’ve positioned a fan somewhere in this cavernous stadium to keep it moving. — KEN BELSON Saddest moment of the night. India isn’t allowed to participate in the Olympics because of corruption within its national delegation.  So the three Indian athletes who came here anyway were just introduced under the plain I.O.C. flag. The crowd gave them a hearty “feel better” cheer, but they looked pretty puny compared to some of the rowdier delegations like Germany and Venezuela.  Here’s to seeing India in Brazil in 2016. — SAM DOLNICK As the athletes come out, itâs easy to resort to lazy national stereotyping. The Italians are excitable, especially in big groups! The Cayman Islands is small! (It sent only three athletes.) The Canadians are dressed like Mounties! Kyrgyzstan is located somewhere around here, but it is unclear exactly where. Luxembourg and Liechtenstein are hard to tell apart.  As for Lithuania, which has dressed its athletes in a kind of lurid green and yellow ensemble â it is the nation that fashion forgot. Parade of Nations is more fun this year because of the Russian alphabet. Who’s next?! Zimbabwe was one of first in. â John Branch (@JohnBranchNYT) 7 Feb 14 Ken Belson appreciates the Canadians, saying they’re impressive in their Mountie inspired outfits. “Even more impressive are the dancers dressed like cotton ball polar bears dancing around the rim of the track. They have marched in place and in unison throughout, which no doubt has kept them warm in the chilly stadium.” Sam Dolnick was drawn to the comely women in white who lead each delegation. They’re “wearing … well, it’s hard to tell. It looks to some (me) like a birthday cake wrapped around her torso. Is this a homage to the classic photos of Marilyn Monroe bursting out of a cake? Happy birthday, Mr. Putin? “Apparently not. Our friend @nycjim points us to an explanation for the costume. Turns out they’re “Snow Maiden” costumes, because, of course, the Snow Maiden is a classic figure of Russian folklore here come the delegates from my favorite country: “Independent Olympic Participants.” â Sarah Lyall  (@sarahlyall) 7 Feb 14 David Segal, of course, said the athletes get in the way of a good party. “If you subtracted the athletes and the stands from this production, you’d have the makings of a pretty good rave. Trippy lights. Club music. Silly dancing. This has it all.” — SARAH LYALL Each country selects an athlete to carry the flag in the parade. Among the more interesting:  Germany: the Alpine skiing star Maria Hoefl-Riesch; Dominica: Gary di Silvestri, a 47-year-old cross-country skier from Staten Island; Italy: the ageless luger Armin Zoeggeler, going for his sixth straight medal; Canada: Hayley Wickenheiser, a hockey player who has also played softball in the Summer Games; Mexico, Hubertus Von Hohenlohe, a 55-year-old downhill skiier/pop singer/German prince; and Tonga: Bruno Banani, a luger who changed his name to a brand of underwear.

The American flag is carried by Todd Lodwick, a Nordic combined athlete.
 — VICTOR MATHER We are now in the portion of the evening where the athletes parade in in alphabetical order (in accordance with the Russian alphabet, which is why we just watched a movie about it).  âThis is one of the longest and most boring parts of the ceremony,â we heard at this morningâs news conference, and to combat the anomie this can cause, Russia is having the athletes emerge from an underground ramp, like hockey players coming out for a game. I am not sure why this is less boring than usual. It is going to take 45 minutes, and it is being accompanied by ârhythmic mixes of Russian songs from the last 20 years.â As the athletes come out â we are now on Brazil, though Iâm not sure where that falls in the Russian alphabet â they are greeted by a swarm of Russian (?) people in odd puffy marshmallow-ish windbreakers, with the kind of voluminous hoods that people wear when they work on dairy farms and do not want their hair to contaminate the milk, or when they begin their shifts at the nuclear-power station. Germany has just followed Venezuela! Maybe they should show us the movie again.  We’re about 20 countries in, and I still don’t get why each one is led by a woman in white wearing a birthday cake around her torso. â Sam Dolnick (@samdolnick) 7 Feb 14 As David Segal points out, there are three translations of each team name — one is English, one Russian and the other … if there’s a language called Faintly Lecherous Continental, it probably sounds like this.” And Ken Belson says: “Teams from the former Soviet republics are getting warm welcomes as they arrive. So are some island countries that are better known for yachting and off-shore bank accounts, like Bermuda.” — SARAH LYALL Although it took a while, the seats in this 40,000 stadium have filled in well. Reminder: Sochi’s population is 350,000. It is hard to tell what the breakdown is of locals, those in the corporate seats, dignitaries, tourists and the news media. This arena is significantly smaller than London’s stadium, but the Winter Games feature fewer sports. Last night’s marquee team figure skating event with the Russian star Evgeni Plushenko was notable for its empty seats. To spectators, the parade of athletes may be a bit repetitive and a reminder of one’s stale knowledge of world geography. But when you talk to Olympians about this moment, even decades after they’ve competed, some of the most cynical and muscle-covered get misty recalling their march in the opening ceremony. Personally, I think we should cheer loudest for the wee delegations. Go, Andorra, go!!! — MARY PILON Certain parts of the show, notably the identity of the final torchbearer, are kept secret from the news media even once we are in the arena. For this ceremony, one of those is the appearance of the Olympic rings. In London they were “forged” by dark Satanic mills, for quite an effect. Can Sochi top that? We’re about to find out. As fake snow floats to the stage, five giant lighted snowflakes descend from the ceiling. They then gently open up to form the rings. But disaster! Only four open!  What a glitch at the very top of the program. Luckily next up is the Russian national anthem, which is a clear top 3 world anthem in anyone’s book. It is sung full throatedly by a monastery choir that dates to the 14th century. And they hit it out of the park. Meanwhile, people in red, white and blue glowing suits are forming the Russian flag. A fantastic visual picture that mitigates the embarrassing faux pas of the rings. — VICTOR MATHER âWhatâs going on?â Victor asks, and well he might. Seven different islands representing different landscapes of Russia  are floating in from the ceiling, one of which has a dog on it wagging its tail (he is not a real dog, which is probably lucky for him, considering). Smoke is pouring out from the floor.  My colleague David Segal said, “I haven’t seen this much stage smoke since Blue Oyster Cult whipped out the guitarmy in ’77.” — SARAH LYALL This warm-up act was pretty good. They told us to wear these LED devices that blink different colors. One of the presenters said don’t worry, they’re safe. Then she said they’ll last for 1,000 years because plastic doesn’t decompose.  — KEN BELSON The show has begun! According to the official program, the theme is âDreams of Russia,â and it is âthe most complex and ambitious technical show ever attempted in Olympic history.â Russia has just awarded itself a gold medal! The program promises âa modern take on Russiaâs great composersâ that âprovides a musical experience that captures not only the host nationâs heritage but also the range of human emotion, much like the Olympic experience itself.â Victor, sitting to my right, estimates that the stadium is 89 percent full. He has not yet recovered from the excitement of seeing t.A.T.u. perform live, although from here it looked like their skirts had been fashioned from discarded burlap sacks.  The ceremony has begun! We are seeing a movie about the Russian alphabet. â Sarah Lyall  (@sarahlyall) 7 Feb 14 — SARAH LYALL What those on TV won’t see is one of the unsung heroes of the Olympics: the cameraman on a Segway. The use of the battery-powered electric vehicle for this purpose is nothing short of brilliant. So far, he has canvassed the arena to bring Jumbotron shots of our two hosts as they run around getting the crowd pumped up, an interpretation of “We Are the Champions” in Russian, a choir of guys covering Daft Punk in olive-colored suits and who knows
what else is in store. It’s a high-stakes gig: capturing video seen by millions while trying not to fall over. No medals at stake, no sponsorship opportunities, no fans screaming your name, but plenty of opportunities to fail. Perhaps his presence will be a starting point for Segway polo (yes, it’s real) advocates to lobby for inclusion in the Summer Games? Rock on, Segway camera dude. — MARY PILON And now, t.A.T.u. If you’re not familiar with the phenomenon of t.A.T.u, let’s clue you in. The female duo was formed, or rather manufactured, in the early 2000s, their popularity stoked less by their music than by their dressing as schoolgirls and kissing on stage. They had one worldwide hit, “All the Things She Said,” finished a disappointing third in the Eurovision Song Contest, then mostly faded away after their supposed lesbianism was revealed to be a marketing ploy.  But they are still probably Russia’s best known pop band to non-Russians. And after a couple of breakups and reunions, they are closing the preshow at the Olympic Games opening ceremony. And they aren’t too terrible! Better than the Queen cover group, anyway. It is hard to tell from here, but I believe the t.A.T.u. ladies are wearing gaucho-style skirts made from burlap sacks. â Sarah Lyall (@sarahlyall) 7 Feb 14 The real show starts any moment! — VICTOR MATHER Now the part of the show the viewers at home never get to see. A very enthusiastic couple have come out and are “warming up the crowd,” urging us to be noisy in Russian and English. And now a Russian rock group has emerged to sing “the official fans’ anthem of the Games.” It’s probably not bound for the hit parade. About 40 minutes till showtime, and there are a lot of empty seats. I’ll estimate that only about half the general public seats are taken at this hour. Latecomers are in serious danger of missing t.A.T.u., who are performing only in the preshow, we hear. I’m looking at an empty stadium and someone rolling around what I think is a Segway + loud voices in Russian. Love. #sochi2014 #olympics â Mary Pilon (@marypilon) 7 Feb 14 Six Russian pop singers have taken to the stage to sing a bilingual “We Are the Champions.” Sorry for the lack of IDs, but they weren’t introduced and my knowledge of Russian Queen cover bands is limited. The band that is now performing Daft Punk’s “Get Lucky” has been introduced as “the choir from the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs.” â Sarah Lyall  (@sarahlyall) 7 Feb 14 — VICTOR MATHER Greetings from inside the arena. Security lines are moving quickly and bathrooms seem like they have never been used, which is probably true. When you walk to your seats, you’re greeted with an ocean of gray — the world’s largest stage, entirely empty. Surfaceless. Almost spooky. We eagerly await some action.  The kiosks lining the stadium offer Baltika beer, electric blue energy drinks and cabbage coulibiac, a pastry shell stuffed with all sorts of things. I asked the guy behind me if he liked his fish on a stick. “Nyet.” He offered it to me, but I declined and went with a hot dog for 150 rubles.  Fun fact: 10,000 Russians auditioned for the opening and closing ceremonies. Most popular dance song for the auditions: “Gangnam Style.” — SAM DOLNICK Despite Sochi’s temperate location and the stadium’s roof, it’s quite chilly inside, significantly colder than it was outside. Part of the arena is open to the elements, but that doesn’t seem to fully explain the phenomenon.  The arriving audience members are mostly leaving their winter coats on. Your correspondent has redonned his wool hat and is seriously considering trying to type with gloves. The gent’s lavatory, on the other hand, is quite toasty. Perhaps a spot for a respite during dull moments? Nothing is happening yet, entertainmentwise, although some nondescript techno-type music has been playing. By contrast, at this moment at London 2012, hundreds of actors dressed as rustic peasants were engaged in traditional English pastimes for the amusement of the crowd. — VICTOR MATHER I am very happy to be joining my colleague Victor Mather here in Sochiâs not-so-balmy Olympic Stadium. We are sitting  next to David M. Herszenhorn, who will be writing the final article about this exciting event. As Victor mentioned, we learned a few tidbits about the ceremony Friday morning, including that the planners decided they were ânot going to burden our foreign spectatorsâ with weird references to things of interest only to Russians. (They mentioned Londonâs song-and-dance ode to the National Health Service as an example of an unpleasantly parochial element in the 2012 opening ceremony). We have also been promised an appearance by the irksomely-punctuated, ersatz lesbian pop duo t.A.T.u. And the ceremony will run two and a half hours, max. âIf the ceremony lasts five hours, itâs a very painful experience,â we heard this morning, another little dig at London. — SARAH LYALL Let’s take a look at the stadium, because we won’t get many more chances. It will be used for the closing ceremony, but not for any athletic events at the Games. After the Paralympics ceremonies, it may not reappear on the world stage until the 2018 World Cup. It seats just 40,000, half the capacity of London’s Olympic Stadium, and should provide a more intimate experience for spectators. But those on hand are a lower priority, the director Konstantin Ernst confessed at a news conference Friday morning. In every case where there was a conflict, television viewers were prioritized over those in the stadium, he said.  Fisht is named after Mount Fisht (meaning “white frost”) and its translucent polycarbonate roof is designed to look like a snow-capped mountain. It is also allegedly inspired by FabergÃ© eggs, but I’m not quite seeing that. Program for #olympic opening ceremony promises peace doves, Peter the Great + a “giant Miracle Monster Fish Whale.” I’m so in. #sochi2014 â Mary Pilon (@marypilon) 7 Feb 14 — VICTOR MATHER Â Ð¿ÑÐ¸Ð²ÐµÑ (Hello) from Fisht Olympic Stadium!  I’ve just wandered through the sparkling new Olympic Park, with its shining hockey and skating arenas. The park was mostly empty, with most competition not having started yet, but some concession stands were open, and I enjoyed a baked potato for 150 rubles. Unfortunately, doughnuts were not going to be available for another 20 minutes, and I couldn’t leave live blog readers waiting that long for updates from the empty stadium! The soundtrack to the Olympic Park was strictly modern American pop, notably Eminem, Lady Gaga and Ke$ha. But I imagine we’ll be getting more Tchaikovsky than Marshall Mathers on Friday night’s program.  The ceremony proper will begin at 11 a.m., Eastern time, but a preshow with Russian popstars is promised at 10. We’ll be letting you in on all the excitement of that scene, too! — VICTOR MATHER Advertisement
