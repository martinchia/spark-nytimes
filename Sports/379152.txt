Advertisement By RICHARD SANDOMIR The Internal Revenue Service yesterday outlined its guidelines for taxing the income that tax-exempt groups like college-bowl and golf-tournament organizers receive from corporate sponsors. The guidelines were issued as a result of an I.R.S. ruling last year that organizations running the Cotton Bowl and the John Hancock Bowl had to pay taxes on their sponsorship cash because the money constituted advertising, an activity deemed unrelated to the business of the games. The agency contends that the mere acknowledgment of a corporate donor's contribution will not trigger taxation. But virtually every other activity engaged in by organizations and sponsors will be questioned by the I.R.S. For example, if the organization puts the sponsor's name or logo in the title of an event, on banners placed throughout a stadium or on player uniforms, the money will be subject to taxation.

Marc Owens, director of the I.R.S.'s exempt-organizations technical division, said: "No one provision is the touchstone for taxation.

Charitable Activity? The football bowl games have contended that the sponsorship money goes primarily to benefit the schools playing in the games and their conferences, which they say is a charitable, tax-exempt activity.

Ed Knight, a lawyer for the Cotton Bowl Athletic Association, said: "The I.R.S. focuses on whether the donor's name is promoted, but that's different than promoting the company's products. If you're not promoting products, that's not advertising." We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
