Advertisement By FRANK LITSKY and SPECIAL TO THE NEW YORK TIMES John McDonnell, the Arkansas track coach, is a psychologist at heart. As he said, ''You use anything you can.'' Today, an hour before the men's distance medley at the 95th annual Penn Relays, the four Arkansas runners were about to leave their hotel when McDonnell stopped them. He read a story from a local newspaper that said Mount St. Mary's should win the race in record time and Arkansas would be far behind. ''That really hacked us off,'' said Joe Falcon, the Arkansas anchor runner. ''You don't say that about Arkansas. It was a motivating factor for me.'' Falcon ran the anchor leg in the equivalent of a 3-minute-55.1-second mile, and Arkansas won by 9 meters over Mount St. Mary's in 9:20.10, the fastest time in history. The previous best was 9:20.96 by Georgetown here in 1987. Advertisement There is no world record for this infrequently run race, but the time by Arkansas established American and collegiate records. Arkansas won the race for the second straight year and the sixth time in seven years. The distance medley consists of successive legs of 1,200, 400, 800 and 1,600 meters. No Olympians for Arkansas Advertisement Mount St. Mary's, a tiny college in Emmitsburg, Md., ran with four Olympians from Africa: Peter Rono, a gold medalist from Kenya; Dave Lishebo of Zambia, and the twins Charles and Kip Cheruiyot of Kenya. Arkansas had no Olympians, but for three laps Arkansas, Mount St. Mary's and Villanova alternated in the lead. ''If I got the stick ahead,'' said Falcon, ''I was going to run hard for one lap and see if the rest of them would come after me. Then I was going to relax and let someone else do the work, and Kip Cheruiyot did that. I planned to go in the last 200, and I did.''  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

With 200 meters remaining on Franklin Field's 400-meter track, Falcon shot by Cheruiyot and finished his 1,600-meter leg in 3:53.8. Cheruiyot's leg was 3:53.0, the fastest ever here. The first three legs for Arkansas were run by Rueben Reina (2:53.9), Charles Williams (46.4) and Robert Bradley (1:46.0), all with their fastest times ever. Villanova Women Win There was more excitement for the 13,867 spectators. The Villanova women, who won the distance medley by 90 meters Thursday, won the 6,000-meter relay by 120 meters. Villanova's time of 17:22.58 was the fastest in history and became a collegiate record. But this race, too, is seldom run and has no recognized world record. Because one Villanova runner, Sonia O'Sullivan of Ireland, was not an American, Villanova could not get the American record. That went to Wisconsin, which finished second in 17:43.39. Other outstanding performances came from Tony Washington of Syracuse in the men's discus throw (205 feet 8 inches, a meet and personal record) and Texas in the women's 400-meter relay final (45.01 seconds). Texas finished first in the women's sprint medley in 3:47.94. But the staggers for the staggered start were found to have been measured incorrectly, and the race will be re-run Saturday.  PAWTUCKET SCHOOL WINS MEDLEY St. Raphael High School of Pawtucket, R.I., with an enrollment of 350 boys, won its first Penn Relays championship. In the distance medley, the anchorman, Andrew Butler, brought his team from seventh to first place. The winning time was 10:12.54 seconds. Advertisement Todd Orvis of Colonie Central in Albany won his third major title this year, taking the 1,500-meter run in 3:52.50. Orvis won the New York State and National Mile indoor titles last month. John Stephens of North Rockland High School in Haverstraw, N.Y., became the first shot-put competitor to win the event two years in a row with an effort of 61 feet 10 1/2 inches.
