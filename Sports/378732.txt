Nick Novak had to relieve himself. So Novak, the San Diego Chargersâ kicker, took a knee in Sundayâs game against the Denver Broncos and did his business â with TV viewers watching from behind. Seven seconds of Novakâs urinary imperative went viral, prompting a fan on NFL.com to adopt Will Ferrellâs sign-off as a fictional San Diego anchorman to the unique TV moment: âStay classy, San Diego.â Novak picked a lousy time to kneel before a Gatorade cart and do what he had to do as a Chargers staffer held up a Gatorade towel to shield him, which is no way to treat an official N.F.L. sponsor whose product is widely known for being poured over the heads of victorious coaches.  At almost any other time of the game, CBS would have been showing commercials. But Denver had just tied the score, 13-13. There was just 1 minute 34 seconds left in the fourth quarter. But CBS stayed live, alternating sideline shots with highlights and statistics in advance of Denverâs kickoff to San Diego. And then came the shot of Novak. A viewer might have expected to see him practicing a potentially game-winning field goal into a net. Not Novak, at least not when CBS caught up to him. Ian Eagle and Dan Fouts, CBSâs announcers, said nothing about Novak and his precious bodily fluids. Eagle said, âNovak did hit on a 53-yarder earlier today,â and a CBS graphic showed that the Chargers probably had to get to the Broncosâ 34-yard line to be in his kicking range. âDoing this for as long as Iâve done it, your instincts kick in,â Eagle said Monday, âand there was nothing I could say that would further punctuate the moment.â But Eagle said he was surprised. âThis is my 14th year calling the N.F.L. and Iâve never noticed a player on the sidelines relieving himself,â he said, and added, âIf itâs not caught on TV, it didnât happen in the minds of television viewers.â That is what Novak must have been thinking. After the game, which the Broncos won in overtime — helped by Novak’s two missed field goals, including a 53-yard attempt late in overtime — he said that he had urinated on the sideline before, but without a camera recording the event from behind. Indeed, he said he was not the only Charger who apparently does not feel a need to rush to the locker room. âI usually go two or three times a game,â he told reporters. âIf guys pay attention to that, youâll see quite a few guys go to the bathroom. We canât really go inside to do it. You just take a knee, have teammates hold up towels. Itâs kind of embarrassing, but oh well.â Then he smiled. Yes, kickers are strange. Bob Garfield, a columnist for Advertising Age, said there might be gain in Novakâs embarrassment. âI expect he will be on Leno by weekâs end, and be the cover boy of both GQ and The Journal of Urology,â he wrote in an e-mail. And, there might be a memoir, with this suggested title: âUrine Luck.â The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
