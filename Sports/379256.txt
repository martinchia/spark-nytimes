This N.B.A. postseason has featured the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakersâ being swept away, the verification of the Miami Heat conglomerate in the vanquishing of the Boston Celtics, and an unlikely upstart in the Memphis Grizzlies, who were involved in a triple-overtime game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Now, Memphis and Oklahoma City are offering another first this spring with Sundayâs seventh game of their Western Conference semifinal series. The first round did not feature a seventh game for the first time since the N.B.A. adopted the best-of-seven format in the opening series for the 2003 playoffs. The Atlanta Hawks participated in a first-round seventh game in the three previous postseasons, and last seasonâs finals ended in a seventh game between the Lakers and the Boston Celtics. That the Thunder and the Grizzlies are vying for a spot in the conference finals represents a shift in the N.B.A. For the first time since 2007, neither the Lakers nor the Celtics will be in the finals.  But the favored finals matchup among the remaining teams might be Miami against the Dallas Mavericks, which would be a rematch of the 2006 championship series. Then, the Heat resurfaced from a 2-0 deficit to win the title in six games. The Thunder will play in its eighth Game 7 in franchise history, and its first since the 1997 Western Conference semifinals, when the team was known as the Seattle SuperSonics and fell to the Houston Rockets. Memphis is participating in its first Game 7. The Grizzlies are just the fourth No. 8 seed to stretch a series that far. The three previous eighth seeds lost those series, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Sunday will also be the first Game 7 for Oklahoma Cityâs youthful core. An underlying postseason thread is the criticism the point guard Russell Westbrook has received for shooting too much. But in Fridayâs Game 6, Kevin Durant was blanketed by Tony Allen, and he missed 11 of his 14 shots and scored a playoff-low 11 points. âHeâs saving himself for Sunday,â Memphis Coach Lionel Hollins told reporters afterward. âHe just missed. He had some nice looks and he missed them. I canât say we can take credit for that.â Meanwhile, Memphis started O. J. Mayo in place of Sam Young to space the court, Zach Randolph roared, and the Grizzlies rallied to force the deciding game in Oklahoma City. âWeâve been counted out time and time again in this series, but the resiliency of this team really showed through,â Memphisâs Shane Battier told The Commercial Appeal. The Thunder is 5-2 this postseason at home. Memphis is 2-4 on the road, with a win in San Antonio and one in Oklahoma City. The winner will play the Mavericks in the conference finals starting Tuesday in Dallas. The Mavericks have experienced a long layover since ousting the Lakers last Sunday, beneficial to their 30-something core of Jason Kidd, Dirk Nowitzki and Jason Terry.
