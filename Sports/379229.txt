The outstanding matchups in European soccer this weekend: Saturday Manchester City vs. Stoke City For most of the previous century, sports and much of life in England stopped while the F.A. Cup final took place at Wembley. Englandâs first trophy, it had the entire world watching once broadcasting developed. Times change. The sheiks of Abu Dhabi now own Manchester City, and they just might stop what they are doing while their team plays to win its first F.A. Cup since 1969. Folks in Stoke, which has never won the Cup, will dream of this day. Man City is the favorite because of the $500 million it spent on players like Argentinaâs Carlos TÃ©vez. Stoke has grown in confidence and is more than the one-trick, long-throw force it seemed. But far from having the stage to itself, the final is not the only game, even in England. City could take the Cup home and find half the city dancing and celebrating for Manchester United, if, as expected, its crosstown rival closes out the Premier League title, also Saturday. And fans of clubs like Blackburn, Blackpool, Wolves and, on Sunday, Wigan and West Ham are all too preoccupied with the battle to evade relegation from the Premiership. Borussia Dortmund vs. Eintracht Frankfurt A similar dichotomy affects German soccer. There will be 80,000 fans partying in Dortmund, where the home club has just won the Bundesliga, but also riot police and security guards because some Frankfurt supporters have attempted in the past few weeks to storm the field and stone their own players, who are in danger of going down a division. Eintrachtâs future is not in its own hands. Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach, another big club fearing demotion, needs a fourth straight victory, at Hamburg, to perhaps stay up and send Frankfurt down. Paris Saint-Germain vs. Lille The French Cup final, but not the biggest thing on the minds of Lilleâs players or fans. Lilleâs bright, attacking style deserves a trophy, but why not two? The club on the northwest coast did the double of league and cup way back in 1946, but its paramount aim this season is winning Ligue 1. The strikers Moussa Sow and Gervinho, and the clever playmaker Eden Hazard, will give the cup final all they have. But then they will wait for Sunday hoping that Marseille, the one team that can deny Lille the league title, fails to win at Lorient. Sunday Celtic vs. Motherwell; Kilmarnock vs. Rangers The huge domination of Scottish soccer by two Glaswegian teams â Rangers has won 53 league titles and Celtic has claimed 42 â is ever more febrile. On this final day of the season, Celtic lags a point behind but plays at home against Motherwell. Rangers travels to Kilmarnock. Since the big two, known as the Old Firm, are a cut above all others in Scotland, Rangers has the advantage. And that would be a fitting way for Walter Smith, the team manager for most of the past 20 years, to ride off into the sunset of retirement after this day. Celticâs coach, Neil Lennon, has police bodyguards wherever he goes. Celtic is a mostly Catholic club, whose coach is a Catholic from Northern Ireland. Rangersâ fans are predominantly Protestant. And the sectarian bigotry that lies beneath the surface of soccer rivalry has become intolerably threatening to Lennon. On Wednesday, a spectator leaped from the stand to try to assault the Celtic coach, and a suspect is now in police custody. So are two men accused of mailing parcel bombs to Lennon and others. The leader in Scotlandâs newly elected Parliament promised to protect ââthis beautiful game of ours.ââ Barcelona vs. Deportivo la CoruÃ±a Less a soccer match, more a celebration at the Camp Nou. BarÃ§a is untouchable as the Spanish champion for a third season in a row. Madridâs enmity is spent; the title is staying in Catalonia; the 95,000 in the crowd will be there to party.
