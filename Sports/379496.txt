Advertisement  The University of Miami now says that joining an expanded Metro Conference is an attractive option. A week ago, Sam Jankovich, Miami's athletic director, said the school, an independent, would not consider joining the conference unless it included all sports. The conference is now proposing to include football and other sports not previously included, said Larry Wahl, Miami's associate athletic director. ''It's viable because it's an all-sports conference,'' Wahl said of the proposal. Under the proposal, the Metro Conference would expand from 8 to 16 teams, adding Miami, West Virginia, Boston College, Pittsburgh, Syracuse, East Carolina, Rutgers and Temple.
