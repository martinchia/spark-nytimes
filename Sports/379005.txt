INDIANAPOLIS â In a great article examining how this city landed (and then prepared to host) Super Bowl XLVI, my colleague John Branch described how local eighth-graders were involved in delivering bids to the N.F.L. owners. It was innovative, thoughtful and downright cute, and surely enhanced the city’s proposal. Well, the charm has continued. Upon checking in at the main media hotel here, I was given a packet that contained a guide to the weekâs events, a map and a slip of white paper with a pencil drawing of a âSuper Kid.â There was also a message. âHi! My name is Alexa,â it read. âIâm happy because youâre visiting Indiana! I love Indiana because  downtown is beautiful. There is so much to see. Have a Super day!â Alexa is  13 and from Indianapolis. Say what you want about Indianapolis, but it appears to have the whole cuteness part down pat.
