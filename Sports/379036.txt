INDIANAPOLIS — DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the N.F.L. Playerâs Association, held his organizationâs annual news conference Thursday afternoon. He smiled often and seemed in the mood to celebrate. This was, of course, far different than last yearâs version. Smith spoke of the labor peace the N.F.L.P.A. reached with the league before the season started and said he would not change anything. He thanked the members of his executive committee, including Tony Richardson, the retired fullback, who Smith said had âplayed for 47 years.â Smith even got emotional at times and at least once referred to himself in the third person. Afterward, he took questions from the news media. When asked about testing for H.G.H., Smith said that issue was a collectively bargained part of the drug-testing plan. He said the N.F.L.P.A. continued to have discussions with the N.F.L. about a potential test. But he also said the useÂ ofÂ such a test would have to be balanced with due process. The union has been consistent with itsÂ feelings on this issue. So Smithâs words, while strong, were not exactly new.

âWe are going to continue to fight to ensure that due process is not thrown away just to have a test,â he said. He added: âNo one will bully us into a test. No one will force the players to accept something that is unfair. How could we?â Smith also addressed the subject of an 18-game schedule, which was broached before the most recent negotiations, but never came close to fruition and seemed unpopular with the players. Smith said it was important to consider every proposal, but added, âThe health and safety of our players is a non-negotiable issue.â The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
