Advertisement By RAY CORIO Top Basketball States Q.    On one of the radio sports shows recently, a caller challenged the hosts to name the states in which more than one Division I college has won an N.C.A.A. basketball championship. Unfortunately, I missed the answer. So how many states are there and which ones are they? A. Seven states fit this situation as snugly as a Princeton defense, with one state, California, having had the most different schools, four, reign as N.C.A.A. champions. That includes, of course, the U.C.L.A. dynasty of 10 titles in 12 years from 1964 through 1975. The following is a listing of the seven states with two or more colleges that went the distance at least one time, with the total number of champions the state has produced in parentheses and the years of triumph for the schools also in parentheses: CALIFORNIA (14) -- Stanford (1942), University of San Francisco (1955 and 1956), University of California (1959), U.C.L.A. (1964-65, 1967-73, 1975). KENTUCKY (7) -- University of Kentucky (1948-49, 1951, 1958, 1978), Louisville (1980 and 1986). NORTH CAROLINA (4) -- University of North Carolina (1957 and 1982), North Carolina State (1983), Duke (1991). Advertisement OHIO (3) -- Ohio State (1960), Cincinnati (1961 and 1962). MICHIGAN (2) Michigan State (1979), Michigan (1989). Advertisement PENNSYLVANIA (2) -- La Salle (1954), Villanova (1985). WISCONSIN (2) -- University of Wisconsin (1941), Marquette (1977). Oddly, the state of Indiana, which has produced five of the 53 N.C.A.A. champions and has a good percentage shot at another one this spring, failed to make the group of states with multischool champions. That's because all five title teams wore Indiana University jerseys -- in 1940, 1953, 1976, 1981 and 1987. Home Runs in a Row Q.    What is the major league record for consecutive home runs by a team in a game? A. Four four-baggers in a row is still the record, and the three teams that accomplished it did so in a span of three years starting more than 30 years ago. On June 8, 1961, Eddie Mathews, Henry Aaron, Joe Adcock and Frank Thomas circled the bases in succession for the Milwaukee Braves against the Reds in Cincinnati during a year the Reds won the National League pennant. It happened in the seventh inning of a game the Braves lost, 10-8.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

On July 31, 1963, in Cleveland, Woodie Held, Pedro Ramos (a pitcher), Tito Francona and Larry Brown stroked consecutive homers for the Indians against the Los Angeles Angels. It happened in the sixth inning of a game that went Cleveland's way, 9-5. On May 2, 1964, the Minnesota Twins' foursome of Tony Oliva, Bob Allison, Jimmie Hall and Harmon Killebrew homered in succession against the Athletics in Kansas City. It happened in the 11th inning of a 3-3 game, and the late-inning powdering powered the Twins to a 7-3 triumph. College Football Toughies Q.    The University of Miami football team has been ranked first, second or third in seven of the last nine years in the final regular-season polls of The Associated Press, which gathers votes of sportswriters and broadcasters. How many times has Miami had the most difficult schedule in those years? A. None. Despite being ranked first four times, second twice and third once by the A.P. since 1983, the Hurricanes never finished a regular season in those years atop the toughest-schedule ranking issued by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Such a ranking is based on teams playing a minimum of nine Division I-A opponents, and they include neither bowl games nor games with opponents outside Division I-A. This past year, for example, when Miami went 11-0 in the regular season, the Hurricanes' schedule was deemed 19th toughest because their opponents went 61-47-2. Ranked first was South Carolina, which went 3-6-2 in a season in which its opponents were 56-31-2. Miami has placed first only once in difficulty of schedule, in 1977, with a team that was more wisp than hurricane. It was also the first year the N.C.A.A. kept statistics on schedule difficulty. Under Coach Lou Saban, Miami went 3-8-0 versus opponents with a combined record of 66-42-2, and no one had a tougher time of it.
