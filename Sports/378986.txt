Advertisement By WILLIAM N. WALLACE New Hampshire defeated Northeastern, 4-2, yesterday to restore some order to tournament hockey after two of the nation's top teams, Boston University and Harvard, were eliminated on Saturday night. The victory for New Hampshire, which finished second in regular-season play and thus was seeded second, qualified the team for Hockey East's final-four tournament at Boston Garden on Thursday and Saturday. Boston University was upset by Boston College, 5-2, on the Terriers' home rink. The Eagles were seeded fifth to the Terriers' fourth, but their records were hardly comparable, B.U.'s 19-17-3 to B.C.'s 22-7-4. Maine, Hockey East's first-place team and ranked No. 1 in the nation, routed Merrimack, 10-0, last night at Orono, Me. The Black Bears will play Boston College, and Providence will meet New Hampshire on Thursday. The Shocking ECAC Advertisement In ECAC Hockey, both the first- and fourth-seeded teams, Harvard and Yale, were beaten. The Crimson lost at home in overtime, 4-3, to Rensselaer, a team that had finished 10th in the league standing, had lost twice to Harvard in the regular season by a total margin of 10 goals and had also dropped six playoff games and tied one against Harvard in the past five seasons. Advertisement Yale lost to Cornell, 4-1. Second-seeded St. Lawrence was an 8-3 winner over No. 6 Brown, and No. 3 Clarkson beat No. 7 Princeton, 6-3.
