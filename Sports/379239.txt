Novak Djokovic pasted Victor Hanescu in the second round at Roland Garros on Wednesday for his 41st straight victory, drawing him closer to Guillermo Vilasâs record 46-match streak set in 1977. To tie the mark, Djokovic would have to win in Paris. Most of his victories over the last half year have been comfortable or blowouts, or even unprecedented: no one has ever made Rafael Nadal look so ordinary on clay. But the law of averages doesnât care about any of that. It says Novak Djokovic is going to lose a match soon. Just for exercise, and to stray from the herd, letâs propose how and when the streak will end. No one can be certain about the future, but the past can help one make a sensible guess about three things: *Barring injury, Djokovicâs streak will most likely be stopped by a player who has beaten him before. Very long streaks in menâs tennis almost always end this way. Each 40-plus match winning streak in the Open era on the menâs side was stopped by an opponent who had at least one previous victory over the player who had been on an unbeaten run. Regarding Djokovic at Roland Garros this year, there are some big names â Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray â  who easily fit that bill and are still in the draw. (One caveat: Juan Martin Del Potro. Heâs Djokovicâs next opponent and has never beaten Djokovic. But they havenât met since spring 2009, before Del Potro started to regularly beat up on players in the top five and won the United States Open.)
 *The streak will probably end in the 40s. For Djokovic to reach 50, heâd have to fly past every male legend who has touched a racket since the Open era began in 1968. Plausible, since heâs already so close, but there seems to be a sell-by date on these streaks. Those with the longest streaks â by Vilas, Ivan Lendl, John McEnroe, Federer and Bjorn Borg â  all topped out in the 40s. Itâs almost as if the tennis gods have decided thereâs a ceiling that shouldnât be touched. *Thereâs a decent chance the streak will end with Djokovic snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. No way, you say? Well, many tennis fans remember McEnroeâs meltdown in 1984. But if that seems like eons ago, just backpedal to 2005. Federer was on a 35-match winning streak that seemed to have no end in sight (at least not until the next clay court season). He went into the final of the Tour Finals having beaten his opponent, David Nalbandian, in their three most recent meetings. Federer grabbed a two-sets-to-love lead, squandered it, then rallied furiously to serve for the match late in the fifth set. He coughed up that lead, too, and lost. Streak over. Of course, Djokovic could defy all of this and lose in a huge straight-sets upset to a journeyman after 80 victories in a row. But itâs doubtful. Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
