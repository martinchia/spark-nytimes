Advertisement  So unexpected was the sweep by Kristi Yamaguchi, Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan of the world figure skating championships last year that the organizers had to scramble to find a third United States flag for the awards ceremony. They had only two on hand. By now, the three skaters are established stars who could fill the podium in Albertville were it not for Midori Ito of Japan, the only other skater with a reasonable chance to prevent another sweep. Yamaguchi, 20 years old, has the most impressive credentials coming in, as the world and national champion and a skater of brilliant elegance and style. In 1991, Harding, 21, became the first American woman to land a triple-axel jump when she won the national championship and she finished second to Yamaguchi at the world championships. Kerrigan, 22, who was third at the world championships, improved at the nationals to third in 1991 and to second this year. The only surprise among them will be the one who doesn't win a medal.
