Throughout the college hockey season, Slap Shot will feature reports about some of the country’s top-ranked teams.  The final Western Collegiate Hockey Association series held in Grand Forks, N.D., between Minnesota (16-8-1, 12-4 W.C.H.A.) and North Dakota (12-9-2, 8-8 W.C.H.A.) had it all: 11 goals, 16 penalties, one victory by each team and dead animals thrown on the ice. North Dakota, ranked 17th in the USCHO.com poll, won 2-1 on Friday; Minnesota, ranked fourth, rebounded and won 6-2 on Saturday. After a North Dakota goal on Saturday that made the game 4-1 fans actually littered the ice with dead gophers, the game was actually delayed as blood was scraped from the ice. Sophomore Brock Nelson scored the game winner on Friday with just under four minutes in the third period.  The two teams traded goals in the second period with Kyle Rau scoring his 13th goal of the season early and Andrew MacWilliam with less than 10 seconds remaining.  Minnesota edged North Dakota in the shot department 26-25, neither team scored on the power play. For the second week in a row the Gophers failed to score on a five-minute major power play in the first period when Danny Kristo checked Ben Marshall from behind. âWe didnât have great rhythm in our power play tonight,â Minnesota head coach Don Lucia said in a statement. âSome of thatâs what they did and some of thatâs what we did and thatâs an area that we need to do a better job of.â The loss was the third in a row for the Gophers, a streak the team broke the next night.  The Gophers got the fast start they needed Saturday when Nick Bjustad scored twice in the first period near the beginning and end. Seth Ambroz and Nate Schmidt scored in the first three minutes of the second period to make it 4-0.  âTo score early in the game, I thought that was obviously really important to get us off on a good note,â Lucia said in a statement. âEspecially after losing in the fashion we did [Friday], giving up a late goal.â North Dakota scored the next two goals, separated by the dead gopher incident and clean-up, to make the game 4-2 with seven minutes left in the second. Nate Condon put the game out of reach with a goal in the final minute of the second and another four minutes into the third. The series was the last W.C.H.A. contest between the two teams at Ralph Engelstad Arena because both are set to leave conference following the 2012-13 season.  Minnesota will join the newly formed Big 10 Hockey Conference while North Dakota will join the also newly formed National Collegiate Hockey Conference. The two rivals will meet next season for one final conference series, which will be held at Mariucci Arena at the University of Minnesota.  The games featured all the scraps and fights that series between the two rivals usually do, capped off by Ben Blood of UND and Seth Ambroz getting into a minor scuffle after Blood shoved Rau while the teams were shaking hands following Saturdayâs game.  A day later North Dakota head coach Dave Hakstol revoked Bloodâs assistant captaincy. Drew Claussen is a sports reporter for The Minnesota Daily.
