Advertisement  CHRISTIAN LAETTNER, at first embraced by his Timberwolves teammates, is being pushed away as Minnesota's losses mount. Even CHUCK PERSON, who once promised to take Laettner under his wing, has become increasingly unhappy with what he perceives as Laettner's selfishness. "My personal motivation is always there," Laettner said after scoring 26 points in Saturday's 113-105 loss to the Atlanta Hawks, Minnesota's 10th in 11 December games. Late in the first quarter, Laettner stole the ball from STACEY AUGMON and drove the length of the court for a dunk. Great play, right? It was, except that DOUG WEST was alone ahead of the field. "The open guy has to get the ball," Person said. "If a guy is 30 feet in front of you and you dribble and dunk it, is that basing the decision on winning? Or is it personal loyalties?" Laettner is averaging 19 points and 8.2 rebounds for the 5-17 Timberwolves. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
