The UConn women beat No.6 South Carolina, 66-55, on Monday night to extend their record winning streak to 100. The 11-point victory was closer than many of the Huskies’ often lopsided wins. Here is a look inside the string of victories that began after a 2-point overtime loss to Stanford in November 2014.

The streak came closest to ending in the opening game of this season, when Florida State led by 4 points at halftime only to lose by 2 in a frantic finish. With every victory, UConn extends the longest streak in N.C.A.A. basketball history. In fact, the Huskies own two streaks that surpass the men’s record of 88 set by John Wooden’s U.C.L.A. Bruins. The Huskies also own four of the five longest streaks in N.C.A.A. women’s basketball history. 100 (2014-present) UConn 90 (2008-10) UConn 70 (2001-03) UConn (1980-82) Louisiana Tech 54 (2013-14) UConn 47 100 (2014-present) UConn 90 (2008-10) UConn 70 (2001-03) UConn (1980-82) Louisiana Tech 54 (2013-14) UConn 47 100 (2014-present) UConn 90 (2008-10) UConn 70 (2001-03) UConn (1980-82) Louisiana Tech 54 (2013-14) UConn 47 After losing their three biggest stars — Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck were the top three picks in last year’s W.N.B.A. draft, another UConn first — the Huskies entered this season ranked only third. After their narrow victory in the opener, they beat No. 2 Baylor by 11 in the season’s second game. It was one of nine victories during the current UConn streak against teams ranked in the Top 5 by The Associated Press. The Huskies’ average margin of victory in those games was 14 points.

The Huskies have only one senior in the starting lineup, guard Saniya Chong. But the two highest scorers on the team, Samuelson and Napheesa Collier, are both sophomores. On the bench this season are two high-profile transfers: Azurá Stevens from Duke and Batouly Camara from Kentucky, both of whom have to sit out this season. And if that weren’t enough, the Huskies also have landed Megan Walker, the country’s top recruit from the Class of 2017.
