Cal Ripken has seamlessly handled the transition from playing (he retired in 2001 after 21 years as an infielder with the Baltimore Orioles) to life as chairman and chief executive of Ripken Baseball, a grass-roots organization that oversees leagues for players ages 5 to 12; operates a youth academy in Aberdeen, Md.; and owns several minor-league teams. Ripken has added a new title: childrenâs book author. âHothead,â Ripkenâs new book, written with The Baltimore Sunâs Kevin Cowherd and published by Disney-Hyperion, chronicles the tribulations of 12-year-old Connor Sullivan, a talented player whose temper is as uncontrollable as his power, and threatens his all-star career. Ripken, 50, has said the tale is somewhat autobiographical.   The news release for  âHotheadâ says the book is âloosely based on a challengeâ you once faced. Can you be more specific?   People automatically assume that the finished product at the big-league level was always the case. I had trouble with my temper all the way through the minor leagues. I just couldnât stand it when things didnât go well. Didnât know what to do with that. Whether it was Little League or playing with your brothers or sisters, that was always a problem. If I would lose â because I very rarely lost â then everything would go crazy. Going up the ladder and the competition became greater, there were more of those cases. To deal with that, my parents, specifically my mom, said that that feeling youâre getting is a powerful force, but youâre doing a lot of negative with it. Turn it into a positive. Do push-ups until you canât do them anymore, go for a long run, so you derive the benefit from this power in a positive way. Turn a negative feeling into a positive one. Kids donât know what to do with that. Coaches donât know. Parents donât know. So this was a topic that was dear to my heart. You want the kids to understand it. Give them solutions, maybe even to the coaches and parents. So I was really glad to do a book about it.  Most people have no idea that in your first three months in the major leagues, in late 1981 and early 1982, you hit .125. How bad were your issues then?  In some ways, I tried to contain it. It was just killing me. I do remember letting it come out a little bit at one time. I think I slammed my helmet on the ground after an at-bat. Ken Singleton took me into the video room the next day. He showed me the example of what I did: âHow do you feel about that? What does it look like?â âIt looks horrible.â He said: âWe donât do that up here. We put our bat and helmet in the rack.â  He took me to a closet down underneath Memorial Stadium. There was this big rubber thing hanging from the ceiling. He told me: âYou see this here? You can come down here and beat the hell out of it with the bat, then come back to the bench.â There were plenty of times I went back there. Nobody saw it. It didnât do anyone any harm.  In the book, Connorâs father says: âBaseball isnât about perfection. Just enjoy the game.â The feat for which youâre most known, 2,632 consecutive games, is a form of perfection, and itâs one that you strove for, or at least cared a lot about. Did you follow Mr. Sullivanâs advice when you were playing?  The father is saying that at that level itâs a kidsâ game â you should enjoy it, first and foremost. For example, many youth coaches make the mistake of making it all about the win. They say, âTake a strike.â Or âThis guy out there pitching, weâre going to take two strikes.â So a lot of guys end up walking. And then you run the bases more aggressively to put the pressure on the other team. And you end up scoring runs. But the kids, they havenât really learned how to hit. On 3-0, a different approach would be, âHey, if itâs a good one, go ahead and swing at it.â You do have the freedom to do that. But theyâre invoking advanced strategies into a smaller game for the sake of winning. In a kidsâ game, 3-0 might be the only opportunity they have to hit. So get a good one and swing at it. Youâre instilling hitting instincts first. You can learn the strike zone later. To be good at the game, you should always pursue perfection. Thereâs always something you can learn.  Connorâs nemesis in the book is a pitcher on the Red Sox, a barrel-chested bully, smoke coming out of his ears, throws inside and hard, and wears No. 22.   Roger Clemens, huh? I think thatâs a coincidence. Iâve never asked Kevin if that was his intention. I never picked up on that. I would imagine Kevin had that in his mind.  One of Connorâs biggest blow-ups occurs after he throws high to his first baseman, Jordy, who canât jump high enough to catch it. Was that based on Randy Milligan?  No. [Laughs.] But there were many first basemen I threw to who would stretch too soon â and when you stretch too soon, their ability to reach both left and right is much smaller than if you have good footwork as a first baseman.  Word has it youâre working on a sequel.  Yeah, we want to do a second one. Weâre going to call it âSuper-Sized Slugger,â about a kid who is overweight and what he has to do about it.  Picking on Randy Milligan again?  No, no. But I do think itâs an issue that some kids have. I wanted to do stuff thatâs real.
