Top-seeded Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark easily defeated a struggling Vania King of the United States, 6-2, 6-4, to gain the fourth round of the U.S. Open on Saturday. By the time she trailed 3-1 in the second set, King had hit 29 unforced errors and lost her serve four times. King, 22, ranks 103rd in the world, 102 rungs below Wozniacki, 21, who breezed into the second week. Despite a thick white bandage wrapped around her upper right thigh, Wozniackiâs ability to run side to side and forward seemed unimpeded. King broke back and pulled to 2-3 as the Ashe Stadium crowd began to swell in the bright sunshine. What they saw for most (but not all) of the rest of the match was an error-filled set of games with King usually winding up on the losing end of a spirited rally. Three unforced errors and a mistaken decision to allow a Wozniacki lob to land inside the line cost King still another game.  Wozniackiâs 4-2 lead seemed irreversible–and it was, even though King drew loud applause with a swinging volley that dropped into the corner and earned her a break point. The crowd was subdued when King hit two more unforced errors and trailed 5-2. In what promised to be a last hurrah, King lured Wozniacki to net with a drop shot, then volleyed Wozniackiâs pop up recovery cross court for a winner. King won her serve to trail 3-5. Another deft drop shot earned King two break points. Wozniacki saved the first with a stunning forehand winner deep into Kingâs backhand corner. But King wouldnât give up, jamming a backhand up the line to cinch the game. Before stepping to the line to serve at 4-5, King received a medical timeout and had a trainer wrap her left thigh with a bandage and white tape. King trailed 15-40 when she unleashed a blistering forehand into the corner for a final winner. One point later, she drilled a backhand long. Her tournament was over.
