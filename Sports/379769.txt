Ever the globetrotter, David Beckham and his wife, Victoria, will be in London on Friday for the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton. Beckham played the full 90 minutes in the Los Angeles Galaxyâs 3-0 victory against visiting Portland on Saturday night, and a trip home for the wedding, in Westminster Abbey, apparently will not be an impediment to Beckham jetting off back to the United States for the Galaxyâs game outside Dallas this Saturday. âObviously, itâs not ideal with the travel, but itâs a royal wedding and those donât come around very often,â Beckham told The Los Angeles Times. âSo Iâll be there for the game, but itâll be down to Bruce to decide if I play or not.â Beckham was referring to Los Angeles Coach Bruce Arena.  âIâll go to the wedding on Friday and then Iâll fly out of London straight to Dallas on Saturday morning. Iâll arrive before the team,â Beckham said. âIâm used to the travel. Iâll speak to the manager. Itâll be down to the manager to see how I feel on the day of the game and Iâll do everything right and do everything that is best for the team.â Asked for his view, Arena said cryptically: âI donât comment on his social calendar. Davidâs playing against Dallas.â  Beckham, who will turn 36 next month, remains the king of world soccer, at least financially, according to the latest list of the highest-paid players released by Forbes magazine. Between his salary and endorsement deals, Forbes said that Beckham earned $40 million last year. The top five, according to Forbes, are Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo ($38 million), Lionel Messi ($32 million), KakÃ¡ ($25 million) and Ronaldinho ($24 million).
