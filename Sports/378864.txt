Advertisement  The Devils were off yesterday, but defenseman SLAVA FETISOV spent several hours in custody in a Newark court as part of a dispute with his former agent. Fetisov was taken into custody by United States marshals on orders of a Federal judge, who released him after a hearing. The dispute revolves around a 1989 agreement Fetisov signed with MARK MALKOVICH, a classical music promoter from Rhode Island who maintains that he signed Fetisov and four other Soviet hockey players to agent contracts as the Soviet sports agency began to loosen its grip on athletes.  Malkovich has asked for more than $1 million from Fetisov to compensate for unpaid commissions and lost endorsements. Arguing that Fetisov would flee the country at season's end to avoid paying the commission, Malkovich asked United States District Judge DICKINSON DEBEVOISE to detain Fetisov until the hockey player posted a $150,000 bond. Debevoise agreed, then later reversed the detention order and required bond after a lawyer, ALEXANDER BERKOVICH, argued that Fetisov's substantial United States investments and the crumbling Russian economy would keep the defenseman in the United States.
