 The 2014 World Cup begins on June 12, when Brazil plays Croatia in the opening match. Reporters and editors for The Times will count down to the start of the tournament each day with a short capsule of news and interesting tidbits. The shoulder injury that forced Manchester United’s Phil Jones to leave Tuesday’s Premier League match is unlikely to keep him off England’s World Cup team. It was initially thought that Jones had dislocated his left shoulder only 16 minutes into United’s 3-1 victory over Hull City at Old Trafford. The defender was taken to the hospital for treatment and evaluation, but the injury was found to be not as bad as the club had feared. Jones, however, will miss United’s season finale Sunday at Southampton. “Phil’s injury is not as bad as I thought it was on the night,” the United interim manager, Ryan Giggs, said Friday. He added that Jones would sit Sunday “but should be O.K. for the World Cup.” The news should be reassuring for England Manager Roy Hodgson, whose list of candidates for the World Cup has been riddled with players sustaining untimely injuries. Andros Townsend and Theo Walcott have been ruled out of the World Cup. In addition, Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney has missed two games, and will not play Sunday because of a groin strain. Rooney, however, is expected to be fit for the trip to Brazil. Hodgson will announce his squad Monday, after the completion of the Premier League season.
