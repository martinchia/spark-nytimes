Sepp Blatter has never been shy.  But Blatter, the FIFA president, has been garrulous since the executive committee of soccer’s world governing body awarded the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 edition of the championship to Qatar. First, he called the English bad losers. Then he proclaimed a manifest destiny of sorts for FIFA in the Middle East.  Now, he is offering advice on how soccer fans should conduct their sex lives, and angering many in the process. When asked at a media session in South Africa about the restrictive laws in Qatar criminalizing homosexual acts, Blatter suggested that gay soccer fans attending the 2022 World Cup “should refrain from any sexual activities” whileÂ  in the Arab emirate.  His instructions were met with awkward laughter by the assembly of news media.  Watch the video.  Here’s what Blatter said: “We are living in a world of freedom. And Iâm sure that when the World Cup will be in Qatar, and this will be in 2022, and you see that in the Middle East that the opening of this culture, itâs another culture, because itâs another religion. But in football we have no boundaries.  We open everything to everybody. “I think there shall not be any discrimination against any human beings being on this side or that side or left or right of whatever. Because football is a game that does not affect any discrimination and we donât want to have any discrimination.” Goal, The New York Times soccer blog, will report on news and features from the world of soccer and around the Web.
