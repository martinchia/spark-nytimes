Advertisement  Perhaps discouraged by the San Diego Padres' slump, in which the team has lost 14 of its last 19 games, Jack McKeon, the club's manager and vice president of baseball operations, said yesterday that he would like to give up his job in the dugout and concentrate on operational duties. McKeon told Tom Werner, the team chairman, that he would like to finish the season as manager, then discuss his future. ''I told him my desire is to do just one job,'' said McKeon, who took over as manager on May 28, 1988, and was also given vice-presidential responsibilities last Dec. 2. '' 'Manager' was never a longtime goal of mine, anyway.'' Werner said: ''Obviously, things are not going like we want. But we don't want to be forced into making a decision, either.''(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
