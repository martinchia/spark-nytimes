TAMPA, Fla. â Donât tell Skip Holtz that college athletics is broken and canât be fixed. Holtz, whom I wrote about in advance of South Floridaâs game Saturday in South Bend, Ind., walked on at Notre Dame to play football, and he continues to regard college sports much as he did then: as a privilege that affords the lucky few an opportunity to compete and be part of something bigger than themselves. âIâve been around the game my whole life and I think itâs very healthy right now,â he said. âI hate that all youâre hearing about are the negative stories. There are a million personal stories of people overcoming great adversity and odds to earn a degree, stories of young men that come here with zero father figures and gain the tools to be successful parents, successful contributors to society.â Holtz, 47, told a story, one of many that affirms daily, he said, his decision to choose coaching over the corporate world. There was a player on one of his teams who was the first in his family to attend college. During his senior season, the player abruptly announced he was quitting, Holtz said. As he explained, the thought of living his whole life as he had his time in college â with his days tightly scheduled, with commitments and responsibilities â was too daunting. He could return home, he told Holtz, and hang out with his friends and life would be so much easier. The player reconsidered, Holtz said, completed his degree, and now is a high school coach.

âI donât like hearing what we canât do,â Holtz said. âI donât like hearing about the problems. I want to hear about the solutions. The only way to overcome the problems is to find the positives.â Among the positives for Holtz are the nonscholarship players, for whom he has a special affinity. He believes their energy and passion are infectious. He showed how much he values the effort of his walk-ons by rewarding one, wide receiver Stephen Bravo-Brown, with an athletic scholarship for this school year. Bravo-Brown made the 2010 roster as a freshman and played in all 13 games.  âI think what you learn as a walk-on is nothingâs given to you,â Holtz said. âYouâve got to earn it, youâve got to work for it, youâve got to be positive when nobody else believes in you.â  Holtzâs message is simple: How you get to college isnât important; itâs what you do once youâre there that will define you.
