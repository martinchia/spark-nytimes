 Point guard Jeremy Lin joined the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday in a trade with the Houston Rockets, who also gave up first- and second-round draft picks in 2015 for the rights to the European center Sergei Lishchuk. Lin, 25, will make about $15 million this season in the last year of a deal that counts $8 million against the salary cap. He averaged 12.5 points and 4.1 assists a game for the Rockets last season but lost his starting job because Coach Kevin McHale preferred Patrick Beverley. ■ The free-agent forward Luol Deng agreed to a two-year, $20 million deal with the Miami Heat, one of his agents said. The deal, expected to be signed this week, includes a player option for the 2015-16 season. ■ Chandler Parsons will go to the Dallas Mavericks after the Houston Rockets decided not to match his three-year offer sheet worth more than $45 million. Parsons said on Twitter that he had heard from the Rockets. A version of this brief appears in print on July 14, 2014, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Lin Is Traded to Lakers.
