Advertisement  President Bush is going to mix pleasure with business next month as he attends a baseball opener in Canada, and he even will get to watch a team partly owned by his son. The President will be in Toronto on April 10 for talks with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, the White House said yesterday. After an afternoon meeting, the two will take in some of the Blue Jays' home opener that night against the Texas Rangers in the Skydome. The President's eldest son, George Walker Bush, is a part-owner of the Rangers. Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the President and Mulroney would ''discuss bilateral and international issues of mutual interest, particularly the changes taking place in Europe.'' But he acknowledged that the purpose of the visit was ''mostly baseball.''(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
