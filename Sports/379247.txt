Advertisement  While the Detroit Pistons were practicing yesterday morning in Auburn Hills, Mich., Bill Laimbeer, the starting center, was at a local hospital having his sore left knee examined and treated. Laimbeer will go to New York with the team, and his playing status is reported as questionable for the playoff game against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden this afternoon. But Laimbeer's knee has been bothering him for almost a month, and his teammates expect him to play. Laimbeer has never missed a game because of injury in eight and a half seasons with Detroit. If Laimbeer does not start, Detroit would move the 7-foot-1-inch James Edwards to center and likely start David Greenwood at power forward. Greenwood, a 6-9 veteran, has played only nine minutes in the playoffs, and did not play in Detroit's 104-97 victory Thursday night. John Salley could also start at power forward in Laimbeer's absence, but Salley is more effective coming off the bench. Also yesterday, Chuck Daly, the Pistons' coach, confirmed that he had had a preliminary conversation with NBC about becoming an analyst next season, when NBC begins broadcasting National Basketball Association games. But Daly did not say whether he would meet with NBC officials in New York this weekend. ''I have had a conversation with them, but that's the extent of it right now,'' Daly said.
