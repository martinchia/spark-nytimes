Advertisement  Walter Davis, who is 35 years old and a 13-year veteran in the National Basketball Association, has signed a two-year contract with the Nuggets, choosing to remain in Denver because he has a daughter about to enter grade school there and a wife who loves the Rocky Mountains. Denver initially signed Davis as a free agent in 1988. He has scored 18,140 points during his career, 30th best in N.B.A. history. The Nuggets also told their 31-year-old center, Joe Barry Carroll, that there would be no effort made to re-sign him and said they expected the unrestricted free agent, Alex English, Denver's starting small forward throughout the 1980's, to find work elsewhere.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
