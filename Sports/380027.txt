Advertisement  Nicaragua gave Montreal Expos pitcher DENNIS MARTINEZ a hero's welcome yesterday on his first visit home since pitching a perfect game against the Los Angeles Dodgers last month. Several hundred screaming fans and a guitar-strumming band greeted Martinez at the country's international airport in Managua. The 36-year-old pitcher was given the keys to the city by Managua Mayor ARNOLDO ALEMAN and had lunch with President VIOLETA CHAMORRO. Martinez's feat has taken on mythical proportions in baseball-mad Nicaragua, where local poet JULIO VALLE has published an ode to the pitcher and one radio station has done a brisk business in T-shirts emblazoned with his face. "I want this triumph to be a means for reaching peace in Nicaragua, for it to unite us so that we can forget the past for the happiness of all Nicaraguans," Martinez told a news conference. Martinez was due be honored later in Managua's National Stadium. Today, he will travel to his hometown of Granada before returning to Montreal.
