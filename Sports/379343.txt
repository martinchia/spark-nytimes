Advertisement  AP Mike Pagel, Cleveland's third starting quarterback in three weeks, threw for 255 yards and two touchdowns tonight and the Browns' defense virtually shut down Eric Dickerson in the second half to beat the Indianapolis Colts, 23-17. Pagel, playing because of injuries to Bernie Kosar and Gary Danielson, started for the first time since 1985, when he was a Colt. He completed 23 of 38 passes, including first-half touchdowns of 14 yards to Ozzie Newsome and 17 yards to Webster Slaughter. They were the first two touchdowns of the year for Cleveland (2-1). Matt Bahr added field goals of 21, 29 and 40 yards for the Browns. Indianapolis is 0-3. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
