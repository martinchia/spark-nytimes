Advertisement By GERALD ESKENAZI TORE MEINECKE of Germany was the 46th-ranked male tennis player in the world ("Some people thought I could get as high as 10") when his car crashed in France three and a half years ago. He was in a coma for more than a month. "The doctors thought that if I survived I would never walk, then never speak, that I would be permanently damaged," he said recently. "I was very lucky. I can speak English. I can speak French. I can walk." But he can't play tennis at a world level anymore. Now 25, he has had to learn a new life. Meinecke has made quite a career change. He and his girlfriend, the former Swiss champion, CELINE COHEN, run a small chateau and restaurant in the Loire Valley. It is called La Colaissiere in St. Sauveur. He describes his life after a five-month rehabilitation as "a five-setter." "But to do a sport at a high level teaches you how to live," he said. "You just can't say, 'It's a bad day.' You have to work hard." We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
