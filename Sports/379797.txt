Naming a baseball bat is not a new phenomenon. Shoeless Joe Jacksonâs beloved Black Betsy sold for $577,610 in 2001, and the fictional Wonder Boy made Roy Hobbs famous. But leave it to a pitcher, the Metsâ R. A. Dickey, to come up with the most creative names of all. In the Metsâ bat rack at Citi Field, almost every bat includes a sticker with the playerâs number on the knob. Not Dickeyâs. His bats have no stickers. He writes his number, 43, in black ink in the middle, with a name curled around it. One bat is called Orcrist the Goblin Cleaver and the other is Hrunting. Dickey, an avid reader, said that Orcrist came from âThe Hobbit.” Hrunting â the H is silent, Dickey said â came from the epic poem âBeowulfâ; it is the sword Beowulf uses to slay Grendelâs mother. âJust having fun,â said Dickey, whose mystical weapons must be working. His career average entering the weekend was .246, sixth best among active pitchers with at least 60 at-bats.
