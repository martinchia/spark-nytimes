Patriots quarterback Tom Brady answered reporters’ questions after their 45-3 victory over the Jets. Jets Coach Rex Ryan, Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez and Patriots Coach Bill Belichick also answered questions.  Q: How sweet was this one for you? TB: It was great. I thought we executed pretty well at times. It was a big win. Weâre playing a damn good team, but it was one win. There are obviously many more big games for us here down the stretch [and] none bigger than Chicago this week, so I think weâve got to move on pretty quick. I think weâre way behind in preparation for them [after playing Monday night] and they definitely have a jump on us. It was a good job by us tonight to come in here and play well.
 Q: You threw touchdowns to four different receivers. Can you talk about the offensive line and how they protected? TB: They played great. They always play great. I think I certainly donât take those guys for granted. They work so hard, they take so much pride and theyâre so well coached. We do a lot of stuff with our offensive line in terms of communication and they handle everything so well, so it was a good night for us. Q: Was there something a little extra to this game though, having lost to them in New York and you having three turnovers in that last game? TB: Well, we couldnât afford to lose to them again. You canât lose to the same team twice. I donât think itâs happened here very often since I got here in 2000. If you want to win your division, which is our goal, you canât lose to the same team twice. This is a team thatâs 9-2 thatâs playing pretty good football, and it wasnât their day; it was our day. We made some plays, but we may see them again. Q: Even though itâs a 60-minute game, do you get a sense at some point during the game that things are going well? TB: Not me. I donât. Iâve seen some pretty crazy things happen. You can go back to last year with some leads and we just didnât produce much in the fourth quarter. Weâve got to continue to find ways to produce in the fourth quarter. Our defense really stepped up and made some huge turnovers, got us the ball in a short field and we capitalized. Itâs a good team. Theyâre a good team. Like I said, I think I was just our night tonight. Q: I think in Cleveland you said the offense wasnât in sync. Is it safe to say you were in sync tonight? TB: Well, we made some important plays out there. I think we made a couple fourth downs that were really important. We got some big third downs that were important. We got some situational plays that came up that we did a good job taking advantage of. But it wasnât perfect out there. I think there were a few plays we can definitely do better on. Communication within the whole offense needs to continue to improve, but all in all, it was a fun night. It was fun to be a New England Patriot on Tedy Bruschi night, Iâll tell you that. Q: You played a long time with him and won a lot of games with him. What does Tedy Bruschi mean to you? TB: He’s a great friend. Tedy and I have had a lot of conversations over the years and he’s someone Iâve always looked up to and admired, not only for who he is as a player, but who he is as a person, as a father, as a husband. Heâs a great friend. Heâs just a great person. He’s got a lot of heart. You know, I think when you look around the locker room and you talk about being a New England Patriot, I think thatâs one thing that you better have: a big heart. And no one had a bigger one than Tedy. Q: Some of your teammates said this was the teamâs best week of practice yet. Would you agree with that? TB: It was a good week. I donât know. I think we practice pretty well all the time. Thereâs not too often that we donât practice well because weâll be out there all day if we donât practice well; heâll [Bill Belichick] just keep us out there. Q: You said this week that as you watched more and more film you felt better about the game. What was it that you saw that made you feel better? TB: We have a lot of guys who have god matchups out there: Woody [Danny Woodhead], [Rob] Gronkowski, Aaron [Hernandez], Wes [Welker] and Deion [Branch] â what theyâre able to do. This team plays a lot of man coverage and theyâve got some real good guys and then weâve got some guys who I thought we could really have some good matchups against. So thatâs pretty much the way it turned out. I think those guys that we expected to make some plays for us really did make some plays and we took advantage of some all-out blitz situations that we really havenât done a good job of this year. We overcame some long-yardage situations. The guys stepped up and they made the big plays when we needed it. I think that, more so than anything, itâs our level of execution that we need to continue to improve. When we execute the way we did tonight, we have a great chance of winning.
