 Germany won the World Cup with a 1-0 extra time victory over Argentina on Sunday in Rio de Janeiro.  The game was deadlocked at 0-0 after regulation, but at the 113-minute mark in overtime, Mario GÃ¶tze, a substitute, chested down an Andres Schurrle cross and volleyed in the winning goal.  Though there were no goals in regulation, there was plenty of action, and both sides rued some missed chances.   The title is considered Germany's fourth World Cup, though the first three of those were by West Germany. It was also the first time a European country won the World Cup in the Western Hemisphere after six failures.  The Germans were dominant throughout this Cup, and though this game won them the title, they may be remembered more for their 7-1 shellacking of host Brazil in the semifinal.    Full story Â» Biglia puts Messi through perfectly. He has the goal at his mercy, but sends it wide right. That was nearly 1-0!

 Klose, the top goal scorer in World Cup history, goes off to the roars of the German fans. Mario GÃ¶tze, more of a midfielder, will replace him.  Three minutes of added time. Palacio should have scored for Argentina! Hummels unwisely tries to clear a great Rojo long ball instead of staying with his man. When he misses it, Palacio is in alone on goal. It’s a straight-forward chip.  He manages to clear Neuer, but it goes haplessly wide.  Hummels is the happiest man in the arena.

 SchÃ¼rrle, on the wing, whips a cross and finds GÃ¶tze between two defenders in the box. GÃ¶tze chests it down and volleys it in. A classic goal and one that will be long remembered barring a late surprise here. GÃ¶tze has surely (SchÃ¼rrle?) won the World Cup for Germany!

 After Germany's historic 7-1 thrashing of  Brazil, it is tempting to think that the team is invincible. But Argentina has been quite effective defensively, having not given up a goal since the group stage. Without the injured Neymar, Brazil had no player with the ability to create goals out of nothing. As you know, Argentina has such a player: Lionel Messi. Breaking down Germany will be the biggest test of his international career. The World Cup. Advertisement
