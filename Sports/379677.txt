The Minnesota Timberwolves are, by most measures, a perfectly abysmal basketball team. Only one N.B.A. squad currently boasts an inferior record to the lowly Wolves, and a deeper look into Minnesotaâs performance doesnât yield a rosier outlook. If teams exist in this league solely for the purpose of winning games, then the very existence of the Timberwolves franchise is an abject failure. It takes a unique brand of incompetence to build a roster this incapable, and in that regard, Minnesota is impressive in their impotence. Yet while that kind of bottom-line approach may be the most pragmatic, it hardly does justice to what makes this game and league so great. Winning is grand, but thereâs so much more to basketball. Teams in the league’s doldrums can warrant legitimate interest if they have the right ingredients, and surprisingly, the Timberwolves seem to have that perfect concoction of deficiency, intrigue, and charisma. The human mind is naturally drawn to that which it cannot understand; we seek out causal explanations for all kinds of phenomena, if for no other reason than to satisfy our mindsâ cravings for reason. Maybe thatâs why this Wolves roster â- which is  impossible to understand -â is so captivating.

Kevin Love alone is worth the price of admission, as the league may not have a more impressive rebounder. He should need no introduction in this space; Loveâs 31-point, 31-rebound night against the hometown Knicks has been one of the more remarkable performances in the league this season. That stat line, even in a game between two fast-paced teams, is still mystifying. But even Love, the most steady of all the Timberwolves, has his flaws. Love is strong enough to play inside, clever enough to force himself into rebounding position against any opponent, and has a touch so soft it caresses the rim, yet he still canât finish around the basket. According to HoopData.com, Love makes only 52.8 percent of his shots at the rim, a mark that puts him in the prestigious company of Ben Wallace and Chuck Hayes. Love still scores, but his inefficiency is baffling considering the ease with which he maneuvers around the basket. The peculiarities donât stop with Love. Minnesota is littered with former lottery picks who are both talented and maddening, with Michael Beasley being possibly the most emblematic of both designations. Corey Brewer, Wesley Johnson, Martell Webster, Darko Milicic, Jonny Flynn, Sebastian Telfair â there are no immaculate stars in this group, only curious players whose talent has been brought to a slow boil.  They play miserable defense (and arenât much better offensively), and anyone watching and hoping for consistent execution will likely be made to gag. But the team remains oddly fascinating, and for reasons that go beyond the potential to see Love out-rebound opponents single-handedly or to watch Beasley light it up. Itâs not an ethos, or any kind of specific, defining cultural element. Thereâs just something charming about the Wolvesâ tragically entertaining play. For better and worse, Minnesota is without delusions and drama, free in who they are and what theyâll never be. That powerful freedom can make an excruciatingly bad team very watchable and even more likable. Of course, it doesnât hurt that the Timberwolves themselves are a winsome bunch, even in a losing season. Through a series of videos released through the Timberwolves official website, the team has shown the lighter side of being in the N.B.A. basement.  First came an investigative report into an embarrassing missed high five between Kevin Love and rookie Wesley Johnson. Next was a faux-experimental short film promoting Loveâs annual coat drive. The latest video gem is even simpler in its formula: give Michael Beasley five minutes and a camera, and let him go to work. âThe B-Easy Showâ is pure gold, and Beasley (aka Mike Beasley aka B-Easy aka Skittles aka Grade A, as heâs kind enough to tell us) is as natural in front of a camera as he is trying to do too much off the dribble. Beasley isnât alone though; Love, Johnson, and Martell Webster all put on a show, though Wolves Coach Kurt Rambis is the real comedic tour de force.  This video â and all of the particularly noteworthy clips that Jonah Ballow and the Timberwolves.com team have put together thus far â is a true group effort, enhanced by each player and coach and the synergy that ties them all together. Who says bad teams canât have good chemistry? Iâm not sure this is something that the Lakers, Celtics, Spurs, or Heat could ever pull off (for a variety of reasons), but we should all be glad these Wolves can. No squad can top Minnesota in terms of pure entertainment from the hardwood to the Internet and back, quite a feat for a bottom-rung team. Itâs easy for an elite unit to pique our interest, but for a team to do so while turning the ball over excessively, falling asleep defensively, and clanging jumpers? It may not be an admirable existence, but itâs commendable nonetheless that Minnesota entertains on the court while being a punchline for the best of reasons off of it.
