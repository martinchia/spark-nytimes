Advertisement  Devils defenseman SLAVA FETISOV was suspended for five games yesterday by the National Hockey League for a high-sticking incident involving Pittsburgh's MARIO LEMIEUX on Jan. 2. LOU LAMORIELLO, the Devils' president, indicated that the team had no plans to appeal. Fetisov said the incident was purely accidental. BRYAN O'NEILL, the N.H.L.'s executive vice president, essentially agreed. Fetisov will play tonight against Buffalo and sit out the next five games, starting against Washington Jan. 24. He will return against Philadelphia at home on Feb. 4. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
