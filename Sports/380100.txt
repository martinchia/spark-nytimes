Advertisement By JOE LAPOINTE and  Anyone looking for symbolism at the Nassau Coliseum today didn't need to look further than the Islanders' locker room. From the ceiling, water flowed from a leaky pipe. On the floor, garbage bags and trash cans were strewn about to collect the moisture. "Go in and ask them, they'll tell you how good they are," said Al Arbour, the coach, who spoke with sarcasm and anger in a loud voice. Not too many players were around, at least not right after the game, a 4-1 loss to the Detroit Red Wings before 12,850 fans. Some of the Islanders worked out in the exercise room, showing perhaps more effort on the machines than they had on the ice.

The winning goal was scored at 8 minutes 49 seconds of the second period by Sergei Fedorov, who has quietly and methodically become one of hockey's top 10 players. Advertisement With the score tied at 1-1 on goals by Detroit's Ray Sheppard and New York's Derek King in the first period, Fedorov weaved a passing play with Vyacheslav Kozlov at the New York blue line, drifted to the right with the puck, fired a wrist shot, darted around Dean Chynoweth, pounced upon his own rebound and whipped the puck past Ron Hextall.
