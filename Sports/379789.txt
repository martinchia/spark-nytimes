Advertisement  AP Randy Burridge scored his eighth goal of the season 63 seconds into overtime tonight to give the Boston Bruins a 5-4 victory over the Red Wings that snapped Detroit's unbeaten streak at six games. After Steve Yzerman of the Red Wings broke a personal seven-game goal-scoring drought with 1:02 remaining in the third period to tie the score at 4-4, Burridge converted Bob Sweeney's rebound for the game-winner. The Bruins (15-8-4) had wasted a 3-1 third-period lead before pulling it out. Bobby Dollas and Sergei Federov of Detroit scored 27 seconds apart to tie the score at 3-3 early in the third period. But Boston responded as Allen Pedersen, a Bruins defenseman, flipped Vladimir Ruzicka's rebound past Detroit's goalie, Tim Cheveldae. Pedersen scored only one goal in 68 games last season, and it came in a 2-0 victory at Detroit on Feb. 6. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
