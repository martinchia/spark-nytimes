If Tom Coughlin wins two more games, does he deserve serious consideration as a Hall of Famer? That this question can even be posed is a reflection of the N.F.L.’s roller-coaster nature. Because if Coughlin had lost to the Jets a couple of weeks ago, many Giants fans (most of them?) would have wanted him fired. And plenty of fans have wanted him fired at several junctures in his tenure with the Giants, including before the run-up to his last Super Bowl title, in the 2007 season. So this is more of a speculative exercise than anything — he hasn’t won anything this year. But let’s explore a little. Winning two Super Bowls doesn’t punch a Hall of Fame ticket. Tom Flores won two with the Raiders. So did Jimmy Johnson with the Cowboys. So did George Seifert with the Niners. None are receiving significant consideration as Hall of Famers. Flores has a low winning percentage (.527). Johnson lacks longevity (nine seasons). Seifert was handed a Mercedes by Bill Walsh. Bill Parcells won two with the Giants and will be in the Hall, maybe even this year. Mike Shanahan has won two, with Denver, and will most likely make it, although he has seemed to be trying to give it away in the last five years. Bill Belichick will obviously be in. Everyone else with at least two Super Bowls is in the Hall. Coughlin is tied with Jeff Fisher for 19th in career victories, with 142. He has 114 losses and a winning percentage of .555. He performed wonders with the expansion Jaguars, taking them to the A.F.C. title game in his second season and also in his fifth. If he coaches three more seasons at his current win percentage, he’ll pass coaches like Marv Levy, Bill Cowher, Joe Gibbs, Bud Grant, Mike Holmgren, and he’ll be near Parcells territory (No. 11 on the career list with 172 wins). Extra pointÂ Do you think Coughlin has a better resume than Seifert, Flores and Jimmy Johnson and could make it into the Hall if he wins this year’s Super Bowl? Andy Barall has been a voice of reason on Giants matters. Last January, he wrote: Why Keeping Coughlin Was the Right Call  Below is the list of coaches in the Pro Football Hall of Fame:
