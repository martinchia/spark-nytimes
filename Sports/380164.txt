Because eating at the United States Open is a high-stakes game, we will feature a daily review of items available at the food courts at the National Tennis Center.  Who knew the humble sandwich had designs on world domination? We know this definitively English and American concoction spread to the corners of the globe and produced sensations like the Vietnamese banh mi (which is disappointingly not available at a United States Open food stand). But you can get Mexican tortas at the Open, if you make your way to Fresca Mexicana, at the far left of the main food court. The menu makes the torta options attractive enough, with a photograph of the roasted chicken torta displayed in all its sandwichy glory. But even the photo does not do justice to what you discover after you order one: the sandwiches are giants. I opted for the pulled chicken one, which came with avocado, jalapeÃ±o slaw and chipotle aioli. (Aside to food industry: You can sell me almost anything by putting avocado on it. Almost.) It also came on a hearty roll, so hearty that we urge the Hill Country BBQ folks to wander down the food court to discuss roll dynamics with these guys. This is some serious bread.  At $14, the price was not bad, either, assuming you are measuring on the United States Open curve and considering the weight of what you get in return. It is almost guaranteed you will not be coveting someone’s pizza in a few hours wondering if your credit limit is high enough for another course. That torta should sustain you until you can return to the land of normally priced food. And most important, it was quite delicious. It was not that spicy, which should please the masses; others can add more hot sauce. There was a pesky issue with the cilantro, however. The sandwich assemblers included some tough stems, and each bite meant dragging one out of the sandwich. This is a minor annoyance if you are eating with close friends who do not mind seeing you plucking green leafy things from your chin. If you are trying to impress a date, it’s a disaster. Consider this fair warning. At least your date won’t be listening to your stomach growling or wondering why you are looking at someone else’s sandwich. For $14, you’ve got that going for you. Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
