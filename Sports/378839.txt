Allen Fox coaches Igor Kunitsyn, a Russian journeyman who came back from two sets down to defeat Germanyâs Matthias Bachinger on Tuesday. (Kunitsyn plays Jurgen Melzer of Austria on Friday.) Fox is a former world-class player who has written âTennis: Winning the Mental Match,â and other superb books on the psychology of tennis. He coached Pepperdine to the top of the college rankings, and passed on a lot of his coaching wisdom to Brad Gilbert, who credits Fox with helping him develop his game and his mental toughness. I asked Fox to talk about what goes on in a playerâs mind when they go down two sets to love. âWell, Igor lost the first two sets pretty quickly. Bachinger served big and pounded his forehand,” he said. I”t was a real test for Igor, a test of how badly he wanted it; a test of his drive. Fortunately, Bachinger took his foot off of the accelerator for just a few points, and the momentum changed. But to come back a player has to want to win very badly. At that point he has to summon his will to win and hope he gets some help from the opponent. In every other tour event, you win two sets and youâre in the showers. But three out of five is quite a challenge.â  After winning the third set, the climb gets considerably steeper, according to Fox. âYou are still down a set, with a long way to go. But here it gets to be more about physical conditioning, and Igor began to play smarter, working on Bachingerâs body, like a boxer working the body. He started running the guy instead of hitting with him.â A pivotal game with Kunitsyn leading 4-2 lasted nearly 15 minutes. â Igor knew he was in better shape, so he really tried to punish the guy,” Fox said. “Even though Bachinger won that game, it took a lot out of him. Igor then held easily.â  With the match tied at two sets all, Fox was concerned that Kunitsyn would let up. Itâs very tempting to relax, just for a second. âThereâs a transitional phase at the start of every set,” Fox said. “Itâs when you have to want to win very badly so that you can fight the temptation to let up for a moment. Thereâs a lot riding on these first round Grand Slam matches–points and money. Igor and his wife have a new baby. Now thatâs motivating! He owes this win to the kid.â Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
