 Costa Rica consolidated its place at the top of Group D with a tame 0-0 tie in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. Neither team seemed inclined to press home aggressively, which suited the Ticos. Daniel Sturridge came close for England on several occasions, but his final touch usually let him down.  Costa Rica won the Group of Champions â Italy, Uruguay and England are all past winners â with seven points. The Ticos will now travel to Recife to play the Group C runner-up, one of Japan, the Ivory Coast or Greece, on Sunday. Uruguayâs ill-tempered 1-0 win over Italy gave it second place, and it will now play the Group C winner, most likely Colombia, in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday.  Full story Â»

 Morale in the England camp hasn’t been too good. As well as losing twice and being criticized for everything from his choice of mineral drinks to the employment a team psychologist, Roy Hodgson has been getting it in the neck from another member of the coaching fraternity, Harry Redknapp, who claims that England players don’t really enjoy international duty.  “When I was at Tottenham, when full internationals came around, there were two or three players who did not want to play for England,” Redknapp said. “They would come to me 10 days before the game and say, ‘Gaffer, get me out of that game, I don’t want to play in that game’. “I’d say, ‘you’re playing for your country, you should want to play’. “[They would say] ‘Nah, my girlfriend is having a baby in four weeks, I don’t want to play’ and that is the truth, so it makes you wonder.” It does make you wonder. Would the players have responded in the same way had Redknapp been hired instead of Hodgson? In case you don’t follow English soccer, here’s a bit of background: Before Hodgson was hired, Redknapp was the frontrunner for the England gig — let’s just say he’s a media-friendly coach. His club, Tottenham was poised to enter the Champions’ League, but the team’s form dipped.  The club missed out on a Champions’ League place, and Redknapp found himself out of a job when he was fired by Tottenham … and snubbed by England.  No goals here. It’s an odd atmosphere. One best described as disinterestedly festive. The England fans occasionally sing that paean to futility “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life” (for you non Monty Python fans, it’s sung by a collection of crucified men at the end of Life of Brian) and there are lots of Oles and waves.  England has looked bright on occasion, while the Ticos look quite solid at the back  No goals in Natal, either. So, England goes home. They’ll be joined on the flight home by Italy.  In Natal, there’s a polite handshake between Cesare Prandelli and Oscar Washington Tabarez. So, the two European teams are eliminated from the Group of Champions. Costa Rica wins the group and  will play the second place team in Group C in Recife. Uruguay will play the Group C winner — probably Colombia — in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday. Most likely they’ll be without Luis Suarez. That’s it from me, and from Justin. Stick around for the finale of Group C, up next. Bye! Costa Rica conquered mighty Uruguay and Italy and is on course to win this Group of Death. Its joyous play has made it many fans' new favorite, and striker Joel Campbell has emerged as a breakout star. By contrast, England's fans are morose. The team has not been flat out horrible, but is 0-2 and out of the Cup. Wayne Rooney and company will want a win to salvage some pride. Costa Rica wins the group with a win or draw and might even do so with a one-goal loss. England is out. Advertisement
