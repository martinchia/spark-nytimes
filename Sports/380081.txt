Flavia Pennetta gained her first Grand Slam semifinal with a straight sets victory over Roberta Vinci, outplaying her Italian compatriot with superior consistency and an intelligent use of power. Pennetta worked over Vinci’s one-handed slice backhand tirelessly, playing her two-handed backhand crosscourt with depth and penetration. When Vinci ran around to play an inside-out forehand, Pennetta stepped in and laced a backhand down-the-line winner. I watched Pennettaâs second-round win over Sara Errani, and I was struck by her superb athleticism, concentration and solid, all-court game. But her shot selection was what really caught my attention. She dismantled Errani, who is a kind of defensive genius, by playing patient, low-error tennis until she opened up the court enough to hit a high-percentage forcing shot that overwhelmed her increasingly flustered opponent.  Vinci plays a different brand of tennis, and with her one-handed chip backhand and superb volleys, she is an old-school throwback. She wins by disrupting her opponentsâ rhythm with different spins and heights, coming forward at unexpected times to knock off midcourt volleys. She wins a lot of matches by getting her opponents to play points they do not like to play. In other words, she is very different from her doubles partner, Errani, who wins with patience and dogged consistency. I was interested to see how Pennetta would play against Vinci. From the first point on, Pennetta pinned Vinci deep in the court, forcing her to hit underspin backhands repeatedly. Pennetta attacked Vinciâs forehand side to open up the backhand side again, and to wear Vinci down. I was struck by how rock solid Pennetta played. Her will seemed impenetrable. She dominated the match in every statistical category. She hit 23 winners and made only 17 unforced errors, while the normally stingy Vinci committed 28 unforced errors and managed only 14 winners. Pennettaâs winning strategy was ruthlessly uncomplicated. She made the match about her opponentâs weakness, and she refused to allow Vinci to coax her into playing points that would take Pennetta away from her game plan. She now faces the winner of Wednesday nightâs match between Victoria Azarenka and Daniela Hantuchova. Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
