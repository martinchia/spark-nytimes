Advertisement  John Franco of the Mets and Bobby Thigpen of the Chicago White Sox are the winners of this year's Rolaids Relief Man awards, which go to the outstanding pitchers coming out of the bullpen in each league. A pitcher is awarded 3 points for each save and 2 for each relief victory, and 2 points are deducted for each loss and lost save. The left-handed Franco, who had 33 saves in 39 opportunities and a 5-3 record, piled up 91 points in the National League, 14 more than Randy Myers of the Cincinnati Reds, for whom he was traded last winter. In winning the American League award for the first time, the 27-year-old Thigpen was saluted for setting a major league record with 57 saves. They came in 65 chances, and with his 4-6 record, Thigpen accumulated more points than any other relief pitcher in the 15-year history of the award. Thigpen had 151 points, 7 more than Dennis Eckersley of the Oakland A's. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
