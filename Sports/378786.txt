Park handled the tough opening stretch at Royal Birkdale, in Southport, England, with three birdies and shot a four-under-par 68, giving her a one-shot lead over Suzann Pettersen of Norway (68) and Shanshan Feng of China (69), along with Ahn Sun-Ju of South Korea. Ahn appeared to be the player to chase after what she thought was a 69 for a one-shot lead. She was summoned to the rules trailer, where officials determined that she used her left foot to build her stance in a pot bunker left of the 18th green. Ahn was assessed two shots for violating Rule 13-3. Her par turned into a double bogey, and her 69 became a 71.  Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
