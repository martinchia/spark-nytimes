Redskins (2-0) at Cowboys (1-1),  8:30 p.m. Eastern, ESPN
Line: Cowboys by 5 The Redskins have been waiting a long time to deliver a hearty “I told you so,” so they can be forgiven for a little premature self-congratulation over their perfect start. Rex Grossman called Santana Moss, Jabar Gaffney and Anthony Armstrong âthe best wide receiving corps in the league,â which must mean he has not had a look at the Patriots, the Jets, the Eagles, the Packers, the Saints or about 20 other N.F.L. teams.  Grossman also called Moss âa quarterbackâs best friend,â which means a lot from a quarterback who used to be known as âan opposing cornerbackâs retirement fund.â ï¬The Redskins have certainly improved, both on the field and off: their injury reports no longer come with a separate insubordinate section. Still, the current era of good feelings is built upon a 1-point come-from-behind victory against a team that lost 11 games last year (Arizona) and a convincing win against the eight or nine Giants players who were healthy enough to suit up on opening day. This week, Washington will face a team whose top wide receiver (Miles Austin) is out and whose quarterback (Tony Romo) is trying to battle back from cracked ribs and a punctured lung. The Redskins can give themselves all the props they want if they compile a 3-0 start. The rest of us will reserve judgment.
