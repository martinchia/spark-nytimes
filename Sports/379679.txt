Sometimes, the most biting criticism comes from those who are closest. The former Lakers general manager Jerry West poked a sharp stick at his team during a speech to the Orange County Automobile Dealers Association luncheon last week. “I donât think the Lakers will be good for much longer,” West said, according to the Los Angeles Times. “You can keep a car running for a long time by changing the tires, etc. You canât change a playerâs tires… “If thereâs a loose ball now, how often do they get it? The reason you âCanât play defenseâ is because you canât!” West also threw in his thought that the Boston Celtics are a “very dangerous team” and he “would not want to play them every other night”.

West’s opinion isn’t entirely backed up by the Lakers statistics. They stand second in the West, only 5.5 games behind the San Antonio Spurs. The Lakers points differential isn’t bad: 103.42 points scored per game, balanced by 96.64 allowed. They’re holding opponents to 43.8 percent shooting, the third-lowest in the N.B.A. Coach Phil Jackson agrees the Lakers need to tighten things up before they embark on the playoff run to defend their N.B.A. title. “He’s right,” Jackson said after Sunday’s practice. “We have to do a lot of things right to play defense the way we want to. Most of it is about controlling the tempo of the game.  “Some of it is about speed and outright speed. We’re not the fastest team on the boards. We can do it if we control things the right way.” The Lakers have looked sharp, then sluggish, at times this season. The inconsistency, often stemming from defense, has been a source of frustration. “It’s the toughest time to play defense in the N.B.A.,” Jackson said. “You can’t do it off turnovers very rarely and you can’t do it a lot of times off bad shots.  “It just goes that way. It’s has to be good shots and it has to be at the right time.”
