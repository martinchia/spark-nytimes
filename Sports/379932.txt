A capsule look at the Jets’ 37-10 victory over the Chiefs.  KEY PERFORMANCE The Jetsâ first offensive series after Jim Leonhardâs interception in the second quarter was symbolic: they rebounded from adversity, just as they have for much of the season. They went 38 yards in three plays, sparked by Shonn Greeneâs 36-yard catch-and-run on a screen pass to the Kansas City 2, and scored on Santonio Holmesâs 4-yard reception. The touchdown extended the Jetsâ lead to 14-3, and the Chiefs proceeded to lose 19 yards on their three final possessions of the first half. NUMBER OF THE WEEK: 181 The number of yards Mark Sanchez threw for in the first half, on 13-of-17 passing. It was the most by a Jets quarterback before halftime since Chad Pennington (247) on Dec. 17, 2006, at Minnesota. His 149.4 quarterback rating in the first half was the highest since Penningtonâs 151.8 at Cincinnati on Oct. 21, 2007. TALKING POINT With their third consecutive win, and other fortunate outcomes, the Jets control their postseason possibilities. If they win their next three games â at Philadelphia, against the Giants, at Miami â they will make the playoffs. Will they? The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
