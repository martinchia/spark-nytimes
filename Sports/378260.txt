Advertisement  AP John Smoltz came within two outs of pitching Atlanta's first no-hitter in 17 years as the Braves beat the Philadelphia Phillies today, 6-1. After Smoltz struck out Ricky Jordan leading off the ninth, Len Dykstra ripped a 1-0 pitch down the right-field line for a double. One out later, Von Hayes singled to right to spoil the shutout bid. Smoltz got Rod Booker on a grounder to short to end the game and finished with a two-hitter. The right-hander entered the game having allowed 49 hits and 31 runs in 46 innings for a 5.48 earned run average. The last Atlanta pitcher to toss a no-hitter was Phil Niekro, on Aug. 5, 1973, against San Diego. There has never been a nine-inning no-hitter at Veterans Stadium, which opened in 1971. Pascual Perez, then with the Montreal Expos, pitched a five-inning no-hitter there on Sept. 24, 1988. Advertisement Dykstra led off the first inning with a sharp grounder to the right of second base that appeared headed for the outfield. But Jeff Treadway made a diving stop and threw Dykstra out by a step. Advertisement Nobody else came close to having a hit for the Phillies until the ninth. Smoltz (3-4), who changed speeds well and had a good fastball, struck out eight and walked three, including Hayes twice. After walking Hayes in the seventh, Smoltz picked him off.
