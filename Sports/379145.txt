Advertisement  The Los Angeles Dodgers activated ERIC DAVIS from the disabled list yesterday and made room for the outfielder on the roster by reassigning KAL DANIELS. Before being disabled, Davis was hitting .257 with 4 home runs and 16 runs batted in in 32 games. In all, he missed 24 games with a shoulder injury, and his return may signal the end of Daniels's stay with the Dodgers. Daniels hit .231 in 35 games with eight runs batted in. The team has 10 days to option Daniels to the minors, trade him or release him. Despite his $2.5 million salary, Daniels is expected to be let go.
