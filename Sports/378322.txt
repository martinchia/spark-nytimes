Advertisement  Four days after Coach Jerry Tarkanian announced that he would leave Nevada-Las Vegas, another key figure in the N.C.A.A. investigation into the university's basketball program said he planned to leave before the next season. "I don't plan on being here a whole lot longer," said Mark Warkentien, who was an assistant coach under Tarkanian from 1980 to 1987. "It's no secret that I'm talking with people in the Las Vegas community and outside of it about other career paths. Warkentien left coaching in 1987 and became assistant to the athletic director. Shortly after that, the N.C.A.A. began an investigation into alleged recruiting violations at the university. The inquiry that eventually turned up 29 possible infractions, many of them centered on the 1986 recruitment of Lloyd Daniels, a former New York City basketball player who never completed high school. A major issue involves Warkentien's legal guardianship of Daniels and whether it was cleared properly through the N.C.A.A. On Friday Tarkanian, who has been in constant battles with the N.C.A.A. since 1977, announced that he was retiring after the 1991-92 season.
