 The IndyCar driver Helio Castroneves is no stranger to the Brazil-Colombia rivalry. A Brazilian, Castroneves is teammates at Team Penske with the Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya, and he lives with his Colombian girlfriend, Adriana Henao. “It’s a match every day at home,” Castroneves said. “I’m always losing.” Castroneves had one significant victory Friday morning. He said Henao wanted to put their 4-year-old daughter, Mikaella, in a Colombia shirt, but Mikaella said: “I want a Brazil. Daddy’s Brazil.” So Mikaella wore a Brazil dress to match her father’s blue Brazil jersey. “The kids know,” said Castroneves, who said he did not try to influence his daughter’s clothing choice. “She has the sense.” He needed his daughter on his side. Castroneves found himself greatly outnumbered by Colombians in the paddock at Pocono Raceway in Pennsylvania at a viewing party for the Colombia-Brazil game at the World Cup on Friday afternoon.

Advertisement “For me it’s the first time to do a full series with other Colombians,” said Montoya, 38, who also spent six seasons in Formula One and nine seasons in Nascar. Last Saturday, shortly after Colombia defeated Uruguay in the Round of 16 at the World Cup, the rookie Carlos Huertas led a Colombian sweep in the first race of the Grand Prix of Houston, with Montoya finishing second and Carlos Muñoz third. Huertas, 23, and Muñoz, 22, who looked up to Montoya growing up, posed with him on the victory stage, holding the yellow, blue and red Colombian flag.

On Friday, the three Colombians gathered around a table at Pocono with the fourth Colombian driver, Sebastián Saavedra, and friends and family. Montoya said he was not a huge soccer fan but had been in attendance at one of the best matches in Colombia’s World Cup history, a 1-1 draw against the eventual champion West Germany at the 1990 tournament in Italy. Montoya, then 14, had been racing go-carts about an hour away from Milan, where the match was held, so he and his father decided to go. Montoya called Friday’s match a family feud for him and Castroneves, but he could not compete with his teammate’s enthusiasm. Castroneves, confident in Brazil’s chances from the start, was the center of it all, often without the helpful presence of his fellow Brazilian driver Tony Kanaan, a big soccer fan who said he had once had to shave his head  like the former Brazil star Ronaldo’s after losing a World Cup bet. On the team plane to Pocono that afternoon, Castroneves had also been surrounded by Colombians, including his girlfriend and Montoya’s family. He said he had issued a disclaimer to his rivals.

What his friends seemed to take personally was the whistle. Frequently standing amid a sea of Colombia jerseys, Castroneves blew a white whistle, causing Henao to put a hand in his face repeatedly to make him stop. When Colombia scored on a penalty kick in the second half to cut Brazil’s lead to 2-1, Henao and Montoya’s wife, Connie, retaliated against a chastened Castroneves by blowing whistles close to his face. But Brazil won. Castroneves was given a small silver trophy, which he raised over his head in triumph. He danced, alone, and blew a few celebratory whistles in Henao’s direction for good measure. The couple eventually hugged, peace made.
