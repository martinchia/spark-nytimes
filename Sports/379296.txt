Tampa Bayâs acquisition of the veteran goalie Dwayne Roloson from the Islanders was another building block in the process of constructing a winner from the ruins of last yearâs 12th-place team. Steve Yzerman is the architect of the Lightningâs turnaround. Named the general manager in May, Yzerman hired the best young coach in the game, Guy Boucher, and the veteran N.H.L. assistant Wayne Fleming to help Boucher. He also brought in a former teammate, Pat Verbeek, to head the professional scouting department. Yzerman then shored up his roster by re-signing Martin St. Louis and trading for Simon Gagne, a former 40-goal scorer with Philadelphia. St. Louis is on pace for a 100-point season and continues to mentor the  phenom Steven Stamkos, although Gagne, hampered by nagging injuries, has played poorly. A series of smaller moves has helped Tampa Bay rise into the upper echelons of the Eastern Conference. Yzerman brought experience to the defense corps by signing Pavel Kubina, Brett Clark and Randy Jones. He added speed and depth up front by acquiring Dominic Moore and Sean Bergenheim. Acquiring Roloson for a young prospect gave Yzerman an essential ingredient: a consistent goaltender. Despite his age, Roloson, 41, was the Islandersâ best player during their troubled season, giving them a chance to win most nights.  In his Tampa Bay debut, Roloson shut out Washington, 1-0. That made him only the third N.H.L. goalie in the past 33 seasons to post a shutout at age 41 or older, following Dominik Hasek and Ed Belfour. After apprenticing in the Red Wingsâ front office and with Canadaâs national team, Yzermanâs impressive debut will earn consideration this spring when his peers select the general manager of the year.
