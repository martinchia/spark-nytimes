After Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson made it clear there would be changes to Citi Field this off-season, readers had plenty of ideas when the Bats blog asked for suggested alterations to the ballpark that could put the Mets back on the winning path. Somewhat surprisingly, a good number of readers did not want to make any changes to three-year-old Citi Field. “Don’t change the park to suit the team – change the team to suit the park!” wrote JTA from Brookline, Mass. “The Mets have a crop of talented young arms on their way up. Leave the dimensions alone and rebuild the rest of the team around pitching, speed and defense.” While some readers wanted the changes to start with ownership, the current players drew the ire of just as many fans. “Mets have the 23rd worst ERA in M.L.B. this year … in a pitcher’s ballpark!!!” wrote MH from New Jersey. “If they shrink the field, I can’t wait to see what their E.R.A. will be next year. (Hunch: They probably will topple a M.L.B. record!) Most M.L.B. organizations design a team to fit a stadium, not vice-versa.” Chrispy from Brooklyn said: “Can I draw some better players onto this new field? Or maybe a tee that our existing subpar players can hit the ball off of? Citi Field is the only thing that’s NOT wrong with this organization.” Of course, those who were inspired to try their hand at a new-look ballpark varied in the seriousness of their approaches. Randy Medina put his brain to work for his Web site readtheapple.com and shared with Bats readers the rendering below. On the left, Medina prescribes an eight-foot wall be erected in front of the Great Wall of Flushing, creating a small new section. “The seats in this section are bar stool seats modeled after Fenway’s first row of monster seats,” he wrote.  “The seating ends just before the hangar door so that it can still function.  This also leaves outfielders a nice amount of space in the left-center-field gap where they can take an unobstructed shot at bringing back a homer.” On the right, Medina designed a fence for the Mo’s Zone that creates a picnic pavilion for Mo Zone guests “with either picnic tables or some kind of bleacher seating.”  GD definitely thought outside the box for his design, below. Let’s let him tell it: “This design, seemingly controversial, will allow the Mets to greatly increase the number of home runs since they are the most exciting aspect of the game.  Fifteen-foot-tall walls 200 feet from home plate will radically change Citi Field’s perception as a pitcher’s park. Ground balls and bunts will likely become nonfactors since the infield can now play in on the grass rather than all the way out by the bags.  Additionally, pitchers can greatly lower their B.A.B.I.P.s while perhaps sacrificing their HR/9.  It all evens out, however, because of dingers!  The grass seating will also greatly increase capacity at no increase in cost.” Alexander Putelo looked for compromise: “My objective was not to remove all of the quirkiness that is Citi Field plus keeping it fair for both pitchers and hitters,” he wrote. “In left field, down the line the dimensions do not change, but as you move from the power alley toward center field, I have moved the fence 10 feet closer and lowered it to 10’ 10″.  This will be a clear fence so that behind this new area, S.R.O. or picnic-type tickets can be sold. “Moving along the wall toward right field, I have not changed the dimensions until you get to the Mo Zone.  At this point, after jutting out a couple feet, I straighten out the fence to be even with the wall down the right-field line.  This new fence will also be clear to allow the Mo Zone patrons to move out onto the old playing surface.” A reader who called himself Trogdor wanted to give to the Mets owner Fred Wilpon what he basically has ignored all along (right). Jeff H. wanted to bring a little Euro flair to Citi Field while solving on-field and off-field problems (below). He wrote, “A significant percentage of the left-field seats presently feature an obstructed view of left field.  Simply lowering the height of the fence will only exacerbate the problem, so it affects all of the left field seats. “I have extended the left-field stands further onto the field by two rows.  This will move the distance of the wall by 6 to 8 feet and lower the height of the fence by at least 2 feet.  This solves two problems at once:  It renders a pitcherâs park more neutral and it will also cause a greater portion of the playing field to be visible from the seats. “While we have the tools out, I have also changed the color of the fence, as well of the seats, to Mets blue.   I have spelled out ‘Mets’ across the seats in a design prevalent in European soccer stadiums but rare in baseball.  Millions of people fly over Citi Field every year.  Why not advertise something other than Citicorp?” Of course, a number of readers all agreed on the “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it” model. It seems that’s a little late, though: The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
