It appeared as if the Yankeesâ game Monday night in the Bronx could be rained out, but that did not stop some players from putting on a matinee performance on Broadway, with Nick Swisher belting out a Backstreet Boys song and Russell Martin playing bongo drums on stage. The Yankees began the third annual Hope Week, a weeklong community service initiative, by joining members of Danielâs Music Foundation, a nonprofit organization that provides musical instruction to individuals with disabilities in and around New York, at a concert at the Brooks Atkinson Theater. Swisher, Martin, Francisco Cervelli and Chris Dickerson showed up in Hope Week T-shirts in a surprise appearance before the group put on a concert for friends, family and supporters. âTo be able to come here and to enjoy this with all these kids and people, itâs just an amazing time,â Swisher said. âMy smile hasnât left my face since we got here.â The Yankees also donated $10,000 to the foundation. Hope Week was started by Jason Zillo, the Yankeesâ media relations director. Danielâs Music Foundation was begun by the family of Daniel Trush, who used music to help during his recovery after one of five undiagnosed brain aneurysms burst in 1997. He was in a coma for 30 days, spent 341 days in a hospital and had to learn to walk and talk again. He threw out the first pitch Monday night. During his recovery, Danielâs father, Ken, sang songs and played recorded music for him. Later, Daniel, 27, learned to play the piano. Ken Trush started the foundation five years ago to provide an outlet for those with disabilities including blindness, paralysis, autism and cerebral palsy. The foundation has grown from a five-person class to roughly 150. âPeople with disabilities need to celebrate who they are now instead of constantly, constantly being told, âWeâre going to try to make you better,âÂ â Ken Trush said. âHow about, âYouâre O.K. now.âÂ â The Yankees players joined the group for songs like the Backstreet Boys hit âLarger Than Lifeâ and âYouâre the One That I Want,â from âGrease.â Martin, who repeatedly professed nervousness, needed a while to learn to play the bongo drums. Swisher, the most energetic of the group, quickly learned all of the choreographed dance moves, and he was not bashful on stage. The former Yankee Bernie Williams played guitar. The show closed with a rendition of âNew York, New York,â which plays at Yankee Stadium after games. The participants and players received a standing ovation.
