Major League Baseballâs new collective bargaining agreement, which is expected to be ratified on Thursday, covers many familiar topics: revenue sharing, drug testing, video replays and so on. But tucked into its many pages is a curious addition that obligates any player who changes his uniform number during the season to buy any the unsold jerseys and other licensed goods that have his name and old number on them. The provision hasnât received much notice because very few players change numbers during the season. But every once in a while, a player does change his number to break a jinx or honor a hero. When that happens, fans are suddenly left holding obsolete jerseys and shirts. Manufacturers, too, are left with boxes and boxes of merchandise that has little if any shelf life. So the league and players union will now mandate that players must give the league eight months notice before changing numbers. In practice, that means they will have to tell the league no later than July 31 if they want to change their numbers for the following season. Players who get traded during the season will be exempt because they wear an entirely new uniform. âLike our other initiatives, this is done for the fan,â said Howard Smith, the senior vice president of licensing at Major League Baseball. âWhen a fan invests his hard-earned money to show his allegiance to a team and a player, we donât want to make that purchase immediately obsolete.â Smith declined to say how much a player might have to pay to buy all his unsold shirts and jerseys. Manufacturers like New Era and Majestic keep some inventory on hand, as do potentially hundreds of retailers.
