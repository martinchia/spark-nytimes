The Rangers have defeated their local rivals, the Devils and Islanders, this week, but wonât consider the stretch a success unless they beat the Philadelphia Flyers Friday night at Madison Square Garden. âI know a lot of people make a big deal about it because of the Winter Classic and the HBO show,â said Brandon Dubinsky, after getting a goal and assist in last nightâs 4-2 victory over the Islanders. âBut the really big deal for us is that these two games against the Flyers, here and the Winter Classic, are for first place in our division and maybe the conference. For us, there’s two teams at the top of the conference right now and four points at stake.â The Flyers are ahead of the Rangers by two points in the standings for the Eastern Conference and Atlantic Division. They have played one more game than the Rangers. While it may be too early to keep an eye on the playoff race, some of the Rangers acknowledged Friday nightâs game has added significance. “It’s going to be a preview of the Winter Classic,” Marian Gaborik of the Rangers said. “Everybody’s interested about that game. It’s going to be our back-to-back, so we’re going to have to make sure we have jump to our game right away. We know it’s always physical, so we just have to play our game and use our strength, which is speed, good goaltending and try to wear them down.” The Rangers face the rugged Flyers after beating the Islanders Thursday night. While New York held on during an intense third period for the win, Coach Peter Lavioletteâs team rested in a Manhattan hotel after traveling from Dallas, where on Wednesday they defeated the Stars, 4-1. Claude Giroux returned after missing two weeks with a concussion to score a goal and assist on three others. After watching Martin Biron beat the Islanders, Henrik Lundqvist will start in goal for the Rangers. If the planets are aligned, Ilya Bryzgalov is expected to play for Philadelphia. The Rangers have shut out the Flyers in their last two meetings at the Garden. In their only matchup so far this season, New York won, 2-0, at home on Nov. 26. Lundqvist made 29 saves for the shutout, while Brad Richards and Carl Hagelin scored the goals. The Rangers lead the all-time series against the Flyers, 111-107-37-7. They have a record of 58-47-23-4 against Philadelphia.
Friday nightâs game will be the centerpiece of the third episode of HBOâs â24/7â series, documenting the teams in the Winter Classic on Jan. 2 at Citizens Bank Park. But to at least one Ranger, thatâs not a storyline. âIt’s just another hockey game, but it’s against a really good team,â said Rangers defenseman Dan Girardi. âI think it’s going to be a hard game.” Slap Shot, the New York Times hockey blog, reports on the Rangers, the National Hockey League and anything that glides quickly across a frozen surface anywhere on the globe, from the snowy prairies of Saskatchewan to the frigid steppes of Russia and beyond, like, say, Phoenix.
