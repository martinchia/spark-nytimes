Looks like there’s room for two feisty, upset-minded basketball teams at Gonzaga. The men’s team has made its reputation over the years on taking out higher seeds with gritty play. Not to be overshadowed, the Zags women’s team pulled off a similar feat Monday, taking out No. 3-seeded UCLA in the N.C.A.A. tournament to advance into the Round of 16. Gonzaga, the 11th seed, blitzed the Bruins, 89-75, in Spokane. It was a big win in front of a frenzied home crowd at the McCarthy Athletic Center. The Bulldogs (30-4) were down by three at halftime to U.C.L.A. (28-5), but came back for the win thanks to the hot hand of senior guard Courtney Vandersloot and junior forward Kayla Standish.

“(Courtney) and Kayla literally took the game with two hands and took it over,â Gonzaga junior forward Kelly Bowen told the Spokane Spokesman-Review. âThere was nothing UCLA could do. They had no answer.â Vandersloot scored 29 points and tied a school record with 17 assists. She also become the first Division I player — male or female — to score 2,000 points and have 1,000 assists in a career. She reached the milestone with 12:24 left in the game, after scoring on a lay-up.  She received a standing ovation, complete with the crowd chanting “Courtney.” Vandersloot has been on a tear in the N.C.A.A. tournament, averaging 31.5 points, 12 assists, 7 rebounds and 4.5 steals per game. Equally potent was Standish, who scored 18 of her 30 points in the second half. “It seemed like every time she got the ball, she was open,” U.C.L.A. forward Jasmine Dixon told the L.A. Times about Standish’s second-half scoring blitz. The Bulldogs will get to stay home because their regional will be played at the Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena. Up next will either be No. 2 seed Xavier or No. 7 Louisville, who play tonight in Cincinnati. Gonzaga may want a rematch with Xavier, the team who ousted them out of last year’s Round of 16.
