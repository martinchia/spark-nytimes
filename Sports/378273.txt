Advertisement  The Oakland Athletics placed third baseman CARNEY LANSFORD on the disabled list yesterday, and then acquired veteran infielder BROOK JACOBY from the Cleveland Indians for two minor-leaguers. Lansford made his season debut July 19, but was able to get only one hit in 16 at-bats. He returned to the disabled list due to recurring pain in his left knee.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
