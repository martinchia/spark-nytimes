Advertisement  WARREN MOON, who arrived at the University of Washington campus as a 19-year-old sophomore in 1975, returns to Husky Stadium today when the Minnesota Vikings play the Seattle Seahawks in an exhibition game. Since the 1978 Rose Bowl, in which he was the game's most valuable player, Moon has spent 6 seasons in Edmonton of the Canadian Football League, 10 in Houston in the National Football League and is starting his first season in Minnesota. Moon, 37, is looking forward to his return to Seattle. It will be nostalgic. "I'm sure I'll have a lot of reflections when I walk out of that tunnel," he said. "Those were some special days. I have a lot of memories that go back to that stadium for me." (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
