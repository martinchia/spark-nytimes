Advertisement  Brian Bosworth, the brash but talented linebacker who signed an $11 million, 10-year contract with Seattle after he was chosen out of the University of Oklahoma in the 1987 supplemental draft, was waived by the Seahawks yesterday after failing a physical on the injured right shoulder that kept him out most of last season. Bosworth started 12 games as a rookie, then was hampered by an injury to his left shoulder in 1988 and played in only 10 games. Last season, he played in two games. He finished his National Football League career with 175 tackles and four sacks. Bosworth, however, not only has an insurance policy that reportedly pays him $7.3 million for a career-ending injury, he also has a budding career in the movies.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
