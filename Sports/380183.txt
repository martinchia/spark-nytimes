So where exactly does Game 6 of the 2011 World Series rank in baseball history? Was it the greatest World Series game ever? Thatâs a big statement, and, yes, maybe an overstatement, but the Cardinals were down to their final strike in both the 9th and 10th innings and managed to tie the score in each instance before winning it with a game-ending home run in the 11th. Itâs hard to top that. Still, the Series is over 100 years old, and many hundreds of games have been played, and there are any number of candidates to put at the top of the list. Itâs a subjective category, so submit your own nominations. And here are some memorable games from the past to get the debate going:  Game 4, 1947 â Bill Bevens of the Yankees is one out from the first no-hitter in the World Series when he gives up a two-out, two-run double to Cookie Lavagetto of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Not only does Bevens lose the no-hitter, he loses the game. âWell, Iâll be a suck-egg mule,ââ the broadcaster Red Barber cries as the winning run crosses the plate. Game 7, 1960 â Bill Mazeroski hits Ralph Terryâs pitch over the left-field wall at Forbes Field as the Pirates beat the Yankees, 10-9 Â (the same score as Thursday nightâs game), in a wild Game 7 in Pittsburgh. It is the only Game 7 game-ending home run in Series history. Game 6, 1975 â Bostonâs Carlton Fisk waves the ball fair, then rounds the bases with a 12th-inning homer as the Red Sox beat the Reds, 7-6, to even the Series at three games apiece. Before Fisk homered, Boston’s Bernie Carbo tied the game with a three-run, pinch-hit home run in the eighth inning, the Reds’ George Foster, in left field, threw out the potential winning run at the plate in the bottom of the ninth, and Boston right fielder Dwight Evans robbed Joe Morgan of a home run in the top of the 11th and then doubled off Ken Griffey, who was on first base. All of which is why many consider this the greatest World Series game ever. Game 6, 1986 â The ball rolls through Bill Bucknerâs legs in the bottom of the 10th and the Mets escape with a 6-5 victory over the Red Sox that evens their Series at three games apiece. As in 1975, Boston then loses Game 7. Game 6, 1993 â With Toronto leading the Series, three games to two, but trailing by 6-5 in Game 6, Joe Carter hits a three-run game-ending home run off Phillies closer Mitch Williams in the ninth. Carter cavorts around the bases as the Blue Jays celebrate their second straight championship. Game 4, 2001 â With two outs in the bottom of the ninth, and the Yankees trailing, 3-1, Tino Martinez hits a game-tying two-run homer off Arizonaâs closer, Byung Hyun Kim. An inning later, at 12:04 a.m. Nov. 1, Derek Jeter wins it for the Yankees with a home run of his own. And just like that, Jeter is crowned Mr. November.
