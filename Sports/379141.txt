Advertisement  JOAN BENOIT SAMUELSON has decided not to compete with herself -- that is the runner she was when she won the first women's Olympic marathon in 1984. Instead of trying for a place on this year's United States marathon team, she will seek a spot with the 10,000-meter contingent. "On paper, I may look better in the marathon," said Samuelson, who has been bedridden with the flu this week, "but I'm more eager and excited to run the 10,000." Samuelson, 34, said that she decided several weeks ago to skip the marathon trials and that her current illness, which has cost her valuable training time, had fortified that decision. The marathon trials will be held in Houston on Jan. 26. The 10,000-meter trials will be held in New Orleans in June. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
