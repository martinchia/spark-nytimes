For fans of mass-media meta-irony, Super Bowl week is like Christmas morning. No other event generates more sheer coverage about the amount of sheer coverage being generated. Those of us covering the Super Bowl often self-consciously acknowledge the hype before contributing to it. A Google Search of âSuper Bowl Hypeâ on Monday afternoon revealed 4,123 news articles. Mentioning the hype in a headline or lead is like a mini-apology to the reader or viewer, akin to saying âItâs just my job,â before repossessing your truck. âWe know we have gone too far,â we tell our audience. âNow come with us a little further.â The Appleton Post Crescent of Wisconsin published a classic example of meta-reporting this afternoon. Brett Christopherâs article focused on LeRoy Butler and Jim Taylor, Packers greats who have been swamped with interview requests during the pre-Super Bowl rush. “I’m going to be on NFL Network. I’ve done interviews with Sporting News, PackersNews.com, both Pittsburgh papers,â Butler says. Taylor also talks about his media appearance schedule and availability. Itâs a report about reporting, great athletes sharing information about recent interviews with their latest interviewer.

Butler found time between the Appleton Post Crescent and the Sporting News to appear as a guest on WSSP 1250 AM in Milwaukee. Butler told some old Packers stories, including a funny tale about giving a music CD to President Clinton after Super Bowl XXXI (âHeâs still bumping to that thing!â a host suggested). Butler then discussed the story of the week: the war of words and Tweets between Packers teammates Aaron Rodgers and Nick Barnett. âYou have to know what to say,â Butler told hosts Doug Russell and Mike Wickett, noting that questions about the pairâs relationship will only intensify as this week unfolds. A later guest on the show, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter Gary DâAmato, noted that the Rodgers-Barnett drama has been âblown totally out of proportion,â then spoke about it at length. Nearly every writer to chime in on the controversy refers to it as a ridiculous story that refuses to die before fanning it back to life for a few minutes. It provokes an existential question: if everyone knows that the Rodgers-Barnett feud (which has reportedly been settled) is an overblown distraction, then how overblown and distracting can it really be?  Perhaps the Rodgers-Barnett story is holiday fruitcake, passed around out of a sense of obligation. Or we all see it as a form of self-commentary, making us winking accomplices to its absurdity. No one wants to talk about it, but everyone wants to joke about how obsessed everyone else is about it. The Monday before the Super Bowl is a transitional day: radio hosts and reporters are in Dallas, but players are unavailable, and most media-centered events do not take place until tomorrow. With little else to write or talk about, some navel-gazing is inevitable.  Dan Patrick spent the first few minutes of his nationally-syndicated radio show addressing the proper way to get Ben Roethlisberger to open up about his off-field problems. âI think you have to let him take you there,â Patrick speculated. It was another great moment in meta-reporting: Patrick was not reporting on Roethlisberger, but upon the proper way to report about Roethlisberger. Much of Super Bowl week is just like this: talking about what we plan to talk about. Things will get worse before they improve. The NFL Network will provide live coverage of media day, which amounts to coverage about coverage. And I will be watching NFL Network, then writing about Media Day for the Fifth Down, effectively providing coverage of the coverage of the coverage. Contemplating the exponential self-referential reverb can cause vertigo, but it also produces a kind of giddiness. The hype becomes a warm blanket of inanity, and endless reinterpretations of the trivial start to feel almost enlightening.  Itâs only Monday. By Sunday, we may achieve Hype Nirvana. The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season. You can also find links to coverage from around the league, tips for your fantasy football team and discussion with other football fans.
