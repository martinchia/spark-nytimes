You’re invited to read between the lines of Rex Ryan’s final postgame news conference of the 2011 season on Sunday. You can read the real lines, too. 1) Ryan said there wasn’t “any doubt” that Mark Sanchez represented the long-term future of the Jets, but his last line in a response about Sanchez didn’t fit with his other sentences: “We’ve got to make sure weâre doing everything we can for the New York Jets to be successful.” In later questions, indicating that everything and everybody would be examined, he used a similar line: “We will always do whatâs in the best interest of this football team regarding every situation.” What does this suggest? Could be nothing at all. But it seems that the Jets have their doubts about Sanchez, that they will evaluate Â him and his season closely, and that if they Â think they can get someone better in the off-season, they will go ahead. Sentiment won’t have anything to do with it. 2) For an N.F.L. coach, Ryan displays an unusual degree of candor. Â And he’ll talk about just about anything.Â Â So what does it tell you that he really, really did not want to discuss Santonio Holmes? It doesn’t seem realistic that Ryan knew nothing about the arguments between Holmes and his teammates Sunday. Â Ryan and the Jets went all out in October to deny a Daily News report that the receivers were going to Ryan to complain about Brian Schottenheimer’s system. Derrick Mason was shipped out soon afterward. In the previous two seasons, the Jets Â seemed to have an edge over other teams in team spirit and cohesion, playing their best at the very end of the season. That has to be a point of pride for Ryan, and goes to the heart of his leadership and people skills: getting the most out of players and getting them to work together. The team dissension this season had to have been painful. 3) Ryan laughed off a report that said a shake-up of the offensive coaches was on the way, but never directly denied it. Opening comments….
Obviously a tough loss to explain. You know, you give up nine points on three three-and-outs, thatâs never a good thing. You’ve got to really credit Miami, though. They did a great job. Their kicker, [Dan] Carpenter â man, he was tremendous. He hit that 57-yarder into the wind. I think that gave them some momentum into halftime. Then they made some plays. Their three interceptions obviously were backbreakers. Again, they played well. They had a good game. They deserve to win. They made more plays than we did.
On Santonio Holmes not playing in the Jetsâ last offensive series…
I looked out there and was wondering why he wasnât out there myself, so I did not bench Santonio. Youâll have to ask him.
On if Holmes removed himself from the game at that time…
Thatâs my understanding. I wasnât sure. Iâm trying to follow the play and I noticed he wasnât in there. Somebody told me that he was on the bench.
On if he noticed that Holmes had gotten into a verbal altercation with a teammate in the huddle…
No, I did not.
On if he was bothered that Holmes pulled himself out of the game, especially with possible playoff implications…
Iâd hate to comment on it because I never saw it, guys. Maybe Iâll see it and talk to people about it. Iâd rather not really comment about it until I know the particulars. I know he was on the bench when I asked where he was. Thatâs as far as I know. I donât have any idea if it was injury-related or what it was. So I guess youâd have to ask Santonio.
On his thoughts about the season, especially with such high expectations…
Thatâs my responsibility. Iâll shoulder the blame â 8-8 is clearly not what we are trying to get to. We have to look at every aspect of our team, ask ourselves how can we get better. And weâll do that. We donât want to be average. We all know what weâre chasing. Clearly weâre not there yet and we’ve got to come up with answers. Thatâs what Iâve got to do.
On if after todayâs game his confidence in Mark Sanchez is shaken…
Iâve told you guys I think heâs the long-term solution. I donât think thereâs any doubt. Heâs won a lot of games for us and things. We had three interceptions today â two of them by defensive linemen. I donât think Iâve ever seen that before. Thatâs hard to explain. I know Mark. I think heâs got all the tools to be a great quarterback. Heâs been a winning quarterback here. We’ve got to make sure weâre doing everything we can for the New York Jets to be successful.
On if he believes Sanchez has regressed…
Well, today wasnât his best outing, let me put it that way. He was involved, I think, in 32 touchdowns this year and he had, I think, 18 interceptions. The numbers, we’re going to look into it. Our biggest thing that we care about is wins. Obviously we never won enough to get into the playoffs and itâs my responsibility.
On with all of the turnovers and penalties, how much the team hurt itself in the game…
To the Dolphins’ credit they had a 99-yard drive, or whatever it was. Seemed like a 21-minute drive. I donât think it was but it seemed like it. Twenty-one plays, I think â it was ridiculous. We couldnât get off the field on third down. And then offensively we had the false starts, we kept putting ourselves in a hole, we had a facemask penalty, we had different things. Every time you do that you make it difficult on yourself. At times we really moved the football. We averaged 4.8 a carry. I think thatâs impressive. At times we look good. But you keep shooting yourself in the foot, those things are hard to overcome.
On a report that he is planning on revamping his offensive coaching staff…
[Chuckles] You know whatâs great is, itâs interesting that those reports are out there. Somebodyâs throwing darts or something like that. Thereâs only three people that make decisions for this organization. That person who reported it is guessing or something like that. I donât know what to tell you.
On the changes he intends to make in the offseason…
Iâm always going to chase the Super Bowl. I know I get criticized for it beyond belief and all that stuff. But if you donât then youâre probably a loser, OK? Iâm not a loser. If people donât have the guts or courage to put it out there, then so be it, thatâs on them. I will always chase the Super Bowl. I believe weâll win the Super Bowl and Iâll believe it for the next 15 years. So you can get all the articles out that you want, thatâs fine and dandy. But for me Iâll find a way to make this team better. We will, thereâs no question about it. Mike Tannenbaum is the general manager. Weâre side by side, and believe me, we will always do whatâs in the best interest of this football team regarding every situation.
On what his team was lacking this year and what heâll try to improve on…
We’ve got a lot of time to look at it. Up until this point weâre in the business to try to win games. Nowâs the time we’ve got to look back, look at our football team, see how we can make improvements and always do whatâs in the best interest of our team with the fact that weâre trying to win, weâre trying to get in the playoffs, and ultimately weâre chasing the Super Bowl.
On his emotional state after the game…
Anytime you lose, Iâm not happy with it. Never. Iâm not happy when we lose a preseason game, so you probably see the same emotions when we lose a preseason game. I donât like to lose. To me itâs unacceptable. You’ve got to find ways to win games and thatâs my job. The transcript is via Jets.com, and you can read player reactions there, too.
