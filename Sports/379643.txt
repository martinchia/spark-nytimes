Rafael Soriano will be introduced on Wednesday at Yankee Stadium as the newest member of the team and as the most expensive setup man in baseball. But he is likely to be overshadowed by the presence of Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman, who will be asked to address the fact that he went against everything he had previously stated when he agreed to give Soriano a three-year, $35 million deal.  In several newspaper interviews in the last two weeks, Cashman was adamant in insisting that the Yankees would not sign a free agent like Soriano and thus forfeit a first-round pick in the 2011 draft. âI will not lose our No. 1 draft pick,ââ Cashman said in one interview, with The Journal News. âI would have for Cliff Lee. I wonât lose our No. 1 draft pick for anyone else.ââ But thatâs just what the Yankees did when they signed Soriano. In this instance, Cashman was overruled by the Steinbrenner family, which saw the merits in signing Soriano even if the general manager didnât. Cashman reluctantly went along with their wishes but has not commented since the deal was disclosed last Thursday night. But his appearance at the Soriano news conference on Wednesday will give him a chance to elaborate on just what happened in the Soriano signing and whether he is confident that he remains fully in charge of the Yankeesâ baseball operations.
