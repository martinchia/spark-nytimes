Advertisement  TRACK AND FIELD Nehemiah Earns Revenge in Hurdles The former world record-holder, Renaldo Nehemiah, beat the current record-holder, Roger Kingdom, today in the 110-meter high hurdles at an international meet at Linz, Austria. Meanwhile, Carl Lewis and his Santa Monica Track Club teammates failed again in a bid for a world record in the 400-meter relay. Nehemiah got off to a good start and held on to win in 13.22 seconds, matching his best time of the season. Kingdom was timed in 13.27. The cool weather hampered the Santa Monica quartet of Mark Witherspoon, Leroy Burrell, Floyd Heard and Lewis, which was timed in 38.23, well off the mark of 37.83 set by the United States team at the 1984 Olympics. That team was also anchored by Lewis. Jaime Jefferson of Cuba upset Mike Powell of the United States in the long jump, leaping 26 feet 11 1/4 inches. Powell managed 26-7. Andre Cason of the United States won the men's 100 in 10.18.(AP) Bubka Wins Sergei Bubka, the world record-holder from the Soviet Union, set a stadium record, clearing 18 feet, 8 3/4 inches, in the pole-vault in an international meet last night in Boras, Sweden.

He set the world mark of 19-10 1/2 in 1988.
