 Matt Waldman is the author of The Rookie Scouting Portfolio, an 859-page testament to his depraved obsession with film analysis of rookie prospects at quarterback, running back, wide receiver and tight end. This  series counts down his top five draft prospects at each position. 

5.	Torrey Smith, Maryland (6-0, 204) What Smith has in common with the top prospects at this position is deep ball skill and after-the-catch athleticism. Smith runs with terrific balance in the open field and he has the vision to get yardage in traffic, which makes him a threat on short passes as well as a return specialist.  But Smith needs more refinement in catching the ball away from his body. He also has the occasional lapse of turning up field before he secures the ball, which leads to drops. Like Julio Jones, Smith tends to drop some passes when a defender flashes across his face. His concentration needs to improve on routes where he makes breaks.

Smith also releases too upright against press coverage and he needs to learn how to use his hands and lower his pads through his releases. Unlike three of the players ranked above him, Smith didnât run as much of the route tree, and in the case of Randall Cobb, the Kentucky receiver saw more action between the hash marks than Smith.  Smith is very quick with his change of direction and he plays at a high speed, which will endear him to teams that are looking for a promising receiver. He executes his releases, turns and ball handling with a crisp level of quickness.  As a return specialist or runner in the open field, Smith protects the ball well and keeps the ball away from pursuit. He’s also a physical blocker who likes to come back into the play to deliver a hard hit or work downfield and cut block an opponent with good form.  His game is good enough that with refinement of his route and release skills, Smith should become a future starter. He should contribute immediately as a return specialist.
