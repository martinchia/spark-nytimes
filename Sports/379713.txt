Eagles (9-4) at Giants (9-4)
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Giants by 2 1/2 Neither Tom Coughlin nor Andy Reid has gotten much Coach of the Year buzz this season, but both deserve mention. Coughlinâs stern-yet-fair demeanor helped Brandon Jacobs move beyond the helmet-tossing incident and reclaim a role in the offense, and he transformed Matt Dodge from scapegoat to solid punter. The even-keel routine got the Giants through two different two-game losing streaks, and it kept them focused enough to weather a snowbound day in an airport and produce a blowout against an opponent with something to prove. If trapped in an airport terminal for too long, Jets coaches might fiddle with the runway lights just for a joke. Coughlinâs disciplinarian credibility yields real dividends. As for Reid, Michael Vick didnât suddenly become a playbook scholar all by himself, and Reidâs âMonday morning at the cubicle farmâ mentality moved Philadelphia swiftly past his blunder in the Vick-versus-Kevin Kolb controversy. Reid and Coughlin have led their teams through serious injury rashes, and the work is not yet done: Steve Smith is out for the season, and the Eagles must try to stop the Giantsâ running game without middle linebacker Stewart Bradley, out indefinitely with an elbow injury. If either Coughlin or Reid cared to lobby for Coach of the Year honors, neither would want to show footage of their last meeting, a 27-17 Eagles win last month. That game was filled with turnovers, red-zone mistakes, and sloppy penalties on both sides of the ball. With the division on the line and the wild-card picture cloudy for both teams (the Giants beat the Bears, are in better shape), neither team can afford a lapse. Look for the Giantsâ running game, which produced just 61 yards in the first meeting, to control the clock and their front four to limit the Vick heroics. But this division battle is far from over. Pick: Giants. Jets (9-4) at Steelers (10-3)
Sunday, 4:15 p.m.
Line: Steelers by 6
The Jets, who are suffering through a never-ending adolescence, should take some impulse-control lessons from the Steelers. Successful franchises like Pittsburgh do not strut around and bleat about lack of respect in October, then lapse into histrionic finger-pointing, thumb sucking and opponent tripping during their first losing streak. Instead, the Steelers coast along year after year as a 10-win quality team, muddling through offensive slumps and compartmentalizing scandals. They reach the playoffs, mount a defense-led charge, win a Super Bowl once in a while, then return to business. The Pittsburgh offense has produced only two touchdowns in the last three games, one the result of a 9-yard drive set up by a fumble. Their offense is not slumping as badly as the Jetsâ, but it is close. The Steelers got their ears boxed by the Patriots recently, too. Still, there has been minimal finger-pointing and, not coincidentally, a lot less losing. The Jets are in such a funk that it is hard to imagine them pulling out of it in Pittsburgh, but they should at least pay attention as Pittsburgh shows them how to carve a happy existence out of defensive touchdowns and 13-10 victories. Pick: Steelers.  Jaguars (8-5) at Colts (7-6)
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Colts by 5
While all of America studiously ignored them, the Jaguars quietly evolved into a fun team. They started winning games on Hail Mary passes and beating opponents in 36-26 and 38-31 shootouts. They discovered exciting ways to use the talents of Maurice Jones-Drew and David Garrard, including college-style option plays that catch opposing defenses off guard. Jacksonville beat the Colts in Week 4 with 149 combined rushing yards from Jones-Drew and Garrard and a last-second 59-yard field goal from Josh Scobee. Win or lose, the Jaguars keep things interesting. No Colts capsule would be complete without a reading from their phonebook-thick injury report. The good news: receiver Austin Collie and running back Joseph Addai participated in workouts early in the week, and cornerback Kelvin Hayden hopes to be available Sunday. The bad news is that it may be too late, as a loss essentially eliminates Indianapolis from the playoffs. This is usually the time of year when we start speculating about how many snaps Peyton Manning will take before his annual pre-playoff sideline Gatorade taste test. Instead, we are wondering if Collie can limp from the locker room to spark a miracle against the first-place Jaguars. Feel free to be disoriented. Pick: Colts.  Packers (8-5) at Patriots (11-2)
Sunday, 8:20 p.m.
Line: Patriots by 11
New England has spent the holiday season offering gruesome perspective to would-be contenders. The Jets still act as if they were shaken by their encounter with the Patriots, and the Bears received a harsh reminder on Sunday that a team that cannot run the ball or protect the quarterback wonât go far in the postseason. Green Bay tried to sneak into the playoff picture with softball pitcher Matt Flynn as its backup quarterback, hoping that Aaron Rodgers would stay healthy and nobody would notice. Rodgers sustained a concussion, and everyone noticed: Flynnâs passes need a connecting flight to reach their targets. Rodgers is uncertain for Sunday. The Patriots are very certain. Pick: Patriots. Browns (5-8) at Bengals (2-11)
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Bengals by 1 1/2
In seven or eight years, Terrell Owens will appear on a Pro Football Hall of Fame ballot, and many contrary souls will support his candidacy. They will cite his six Pro Bowl selections and 153 (and counting) touchdowns while pouring gingerbread over his many controversies. When that happens, someone must politely point to this yearâs Bengals — a preseason contender that signed Owens as their missing puzzle piece — and ask the Owens boosters to balance his handful of touchdowns against a 10-game losing streak and comments like these, taken from (where else?) his reality show: “I think there is underachieving, you know, from the top down. â¦ You start off with the owner, you start off with the coaches and obviously we as players.” Then, anyone who feels comfortable with Owens taking the podium in Canton and speaking with Mike Ditka and Roger Staubach sitting behind him, anyone who feels comfortable mounting his image on a wall with Walter Payton and Jim Brown, can cast their ballots for him. There wonât be many takers. Pick: Browns. Redskins (5-8) at Cowboys (4-9)
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Cowboys by 6
Redskins-Cowboys games are rarely this irrelevant. Usually, one team or the other has a playoff berth on the line this late in the season. To find a late-season game in which both Washington and Dallas were this far out of contention, you must travel back to Week 16 of 2004, when the Cowboys beat the Redskins, 13-10, to raise their record to 6-9. (The Redskins fell to 5-10). Washington held a 10-6 fourth-quarter lead in that game on the strength of a Patrick Ramsey pass to Robert Royal, but Vinny Testaverde connected with Patrick Crayton on a 39-yard game-clinching touchdown in the final minute. Donât remember? You will not remember Tashard Choice or Keiland Williams in six years, either. 3:53 p.m. | Updated The Donovan McNabb benching accomplishes little for the Redskins; if McNabb infuriated Mike Shanahan, wait until Rex Grossman misreads simple zone coverage and hits a linebacker right between the numbers. McNabbâs benching, combined with last weekâs Cowboys victory and the Cliff Lee signing, did create a triple whammy of ecstasy in Philadelphia. If the Flyers win a few more games, you may see guys eating cheese steaks while levitating two feet off the ground.  Pick: Cowboys. Texans (5-8) at Titans (5-8)
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Titans by 1 1/2 
Beating Houston does little for a teamâs self-esteem. The Eagles beat the Texans two weeks ago, but the game was so close that Philadelphia came away with serious questions about its defense and ability to convert in the red zone. The same thing happened Monday night, when the Ravens couldnât hold on to a 21-point lead and came away from an overtime win facing a confidence crisis. The Titans are fragile enough as it is; the last thing they need is an opponent that they cannot even feel good about beating. Not that Tennessee is likely to win: the Texans are effective enough on offense to scare contenders, and now that the prime-time spotlights are off them, they can go back to being the fun little team that beats the other bottom-dwellers in 30-27 shootouts. Pick: Texans. Chiefs (8-5) at Rams (6-7)
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Rams by 1
With Matt Cassel under center, Kansas City has an effective power-running offense complemented by just enough of a passing attack to keep defenses honest. Without him, the Chiefs flail around while opponents commit to run defense and giggle about Brodie Croyle. Casselâs recovery from an appendectomy was the main topic of discussion in Kansas City; by Wednesday, he was back at practice and able to joke about the surgery. âI think itâs a pretty useless organ, from what they tell me,â Cassel said in a midweek news conference, sounding like Bill Parcells commenting on the sportswriterâs brain. For the record, the Chargers found Casselâs appendix very useful last Sunday. Pick: Rams. Bills (3-10) at Dolphins (7-6)
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Dolphins by 5 1/2 
The days of Jim Kelly and Dan Marino are long gone, but Bills Coach Chan Gailey, a former Dolphins assistant, did his best to fan the flames of a rivalry that has not produced even a glowing ember since about 1999. âNobody up here likes Miami,â Gailey said. âThese two teams donât like each other. So you deal with the circumstances of what it is, and enjoy the moment, because you love it when two teams that donât like each other go play.â With manufactured enthusiasm like that, Gailey could write promotional copy for boring television shows. âThis week: the episode of âAmericaâs Test Kitchenâ you have waited months for, when Adam Ried finally hits Christopher Kimball in the head with an egg timer!â The Dolphins are still mathematically in the playoff race, but the Ravens, the Jets and the Chargers would all have to do many foolish things for it to happen. All three are game. Pick: Dolphins. Lions (3-10) at Buccaneers (8-5)
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Buccaneers by 5 1/2 
The best quarterback from the 2009 draft is not Mark Sanchez. Itâs Josh Freeman, who has been more productive than Sanchez this season (17 touchdowns and 6 interceptions for Freeman, 16 and 12 for Sanchez) while throwing to inexperienced receivers like Mike Williams and Arrelious Benn. While Sanchez has made doubters of some teammates (and perhaps his coach), Freeman has taken on a leadership role, speaking out against the behavior of his teammate Geno Hayes (arrested for disorderly conduct) and urging the Buccaneers to move past recent off-field incidents. “We have to take a high level of responsibility on ourselves,” he told reporters. “As team captains, as leaders, we’ve been stressing that a lot lately.” Add strength and conditioning coaches to that list, and Freeman could be the Jetsâ next motivational speaker. Pick: Buccaneers. Cardinals (4-9) at Panthers (1-12)
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Panthers by 2 1/2 
The Big Ten Conference, which will include 12 teams next season, announced this week that it would organize teams into âLegendsâ and âLeadersâ divisions; the conferenceâs ability to be simultaneously inaccurate and vague says a lot about the state of higher education. Inspired by the change, the N.F.C. West plans to separate into four sub-divisions of one team each: the Irrelevant (Cardinals), Inconsequential (Seahawks), Immaterial (Rams) and Inscrutable (49ers). Each team can then create an at-large schedule of weakling opponents like Carolina, and college independents like B.Y.U. Fans have been clamoring for a Notre Dame-Fordham football rivalry for generations. Jimmy Clausen (Notre Dame) against John Skelton (Fordham) is as close as we can hope to get. Pick: Panthers. Saints (10-3) at Ravens (9-4)
Sunday, 1 p.m.
Line: Ravens by 1 1/2 
Derrick Mason hung a motivational banner beside his locker this week inspired by a popular video game. âPurple Ops,â a play on âCall of Duty: Black Ops,â represents Masonâs call for team unity. When playing Purple Ops, you press the X button to launch a bomb to Mason, the Y button for a screen to Ray Rice and the R button to trigger a 21-point comeback by a bad opponent. You need elaborate cheat codes to beat the level-ending bosses. The Ravens are 0-3 against the last three legitimate contenders they faced (Pittsburgh, Atlanta and New England), but Mason also has words for fans grumbling that the team should be more than just another wild-card hopeful. âWe could be Buffalo or Cincinnati,â he told The Baltimore Sun. (Ouch). âStop being a pessimist. Be an optimist.â And always look on the bright side of life! Pick: Saints. Falcons (11-2) at Seahawks (6-7)
Sunday, 4:05 p.m.
Line: Falcons by 6
Atlanta got some good news this week when Jason Snelling returned to practice after missing two games with a hamstring injury. With 300 rushing yards and 35 short-pass receptions on the season, Snelling may seem like just another spare-part running back, but he is vital to the Falconsâ success. Without Snelling, Atlanta works Michael Turner like the neighborâs lawnmower, risking injury and fatigue by making him carry the ball 28 times in blowout victories. Snelling is back to receive his ration of seven rushes and four catches, meaning Turner will not be worked to exhaustion in the name of preserving a 21-point victory. Pick: Falcons. Broncos (3-10) at Raiders (6-7)
Sunday, 4:15 p.m.
Line: Raiders by 6 1/2 Conspiratorial skullduggery didnât die in Denver when Josh McDaniels was fired. Kyle Orton (rib injury) sat out practice Wednesday and Thursday. At first, running the team in Ortonâs place was (trumpets blaring, seraphim singing) Brady Quinn (trombone: wa-wa-wahhh). Later, Tim Tebow took the reins of the offense, though the team had not yet acknowledged the dawning of a new era as of presstime. McDaniels would have done it better, making a few âThe Soviet premier has the snifflesâ remarks about Orton while hiding Tebow in a mountain cabin until kickoff. Thereâs also intrigue among the Raidersâ coaching staff, but thatâs about as newsworthy as saying thereâs kissing on âThe Young and the Restless.â Pick: Raiders. Bears (9-4) at Vikings (5-8)
Monday, 8:30 p.m.
Line: Bears by 3
Two weeks ago in this space, while joking about the Bearsâ good fortune, I wrote: âTune in next week, the Patriotsâ plane will get snowed in at Logan airport, forcing them to forfeit.â Well, the snowstorm happened, though it could not stop the Patriots. But it did turn the Metrodome into a broken snow globe, forcing the Vikings to play Monday’s game in frigid conditions at University of Minnesota. The cosmically improbable end to Brett Favreâs Iron Man streak also converged with the Bearsâ imminent arrival, leaving the interim coach Leslie Frazier to choose between the rookie Joe Webb and an animatronic Dickens caroler at quarterback. Some Vikings players expressed concern that TCF Bank Stadium was an unsafe environment at sub-zero temperatures. A stadium with no heating coils might be acceptable to 18-year-old student walk-ons, but it could be lethal to millionaire professionals. Guys, Bud Grant would have made you practice in shorts in that weather. Pick: Bears. Note: The picks are not based on the betting line.
