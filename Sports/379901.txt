The defending champion, Chip Beck; Wayne Grady, and Brad Faxon were third at 134, a shot ahead of Gil Morgan and Gene Sauers at Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club. David Edwards, Barry Jaeckel and rookie Marco Dawson were at 136. Nick Faldo, Howard Twitty and the 1989 Buick Open winner, Leonard Thompson, were in a group at 137. Payne Stewart, the United States Open champion, shot a 79 yesterday and missed the cut. (AP) TENNIS Victory for Edberg  Top-seeded Stefan Edberg used his serve-and-volley game to its best advantage to defeat Aaron Krickstein, 6-4, 7-5, yesterday in the quarterfinals of the Volvo tournament in Los Angeles. Edberg lost only seven points off his serve in the 1-hour-20-minute match and was never broken. After Edberg broke Krickstein in the third game of the match, the two stayed on serve until the 11th game of the second set. Edberg got four break points on Krickstein before he was able to convert and take a 6-5 lead. The Swede won the final game at love. In another quarterfinal match, fourth-seeded Brad Gilbert cruised to a 6-1, 6-3 victory over Steve Bryan, a qualifier. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
