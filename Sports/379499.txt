The September issue of GQ magazine features a story that is highly critical of U.S. tennis but anyone who saw 16-year-old American Madison Keys nearly upset Lucie Safarova, the tournamentâs 27th seed Wednesday, would have to conclude that the future of American tennis may not be quite so bleak.  Keysâ upset bid faltered, 3-6, 7-5, 6-4, but she looked very much like a contender despite losing a dramatic, 2 hour and 24 minute contest to an older and more experienced player.  Playing in the first match at Louis Armstrong Stadium, Keys raced out to a 5-0 lead in just 15 minutes with a barrage of lasers from the backcourt and a dominant serve that touched 117 m.p.h. on the radar gun. (By comparison, Novak Djokovicâs average first serve speed in his 1st round match was 113.)  Safarova, who recently took a set off of Serena Williams in Cincinnati, actually had to stave off two set and break points to avoid a 6-0 bagel before sheâd even fully digested her muesli.  Keys looked so physically strong in the opening set that it was easy to forget that she was playing in just her third pro event. Ola Malmqvist, the Head of Womenâs Tennis Development at the U.S.T.A. told Tracy Austin that Keys was âstill a puppy- a good puppy, but still a puppy,â and a look at Keysâ web site is a reminder that she just became eligible for a driverâs license.  The siteâs bio refers to her favorite colors, her admiration for chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and the conclusion, âI really want a B.M.W.â  Safarova found her game late in the first set, breaking Keys at 1-5, but Keys stayed composed and finally took the first set on her fifth set point opportunity.  After taking the first set 6-3, Keys broke the 24-year-old Czech in her first service game, but gave the break back at 2-1 up. Keys had two break opportunities at 4-4, but failed to convert. At 5-6, Keys showed some inexperience, playing an ill-advised drop shot that cost her the point at 30-30, and then attempting another dicey drop shot several points later that cost her the set, 7-5.  The players traded breaks early in the decisive third set, both won on double faults, which were a problem for both players throughout the match. Keys appeared tired as the match reached the two-hour point but still smiled frequently and looked by no means awed by the occasion.  At 3-3, the teen broke Safarova again, punishing a meatball of a second serve with a ferocious cross-court backhand. But Keysâ powerful serve seemed to desert her in the following game as she was broken again for 4-4.  Serving at 4-5, Keys looked gassed, playing several tired shots that cost her the game and the match.  Keys played high risk/high reward tennis, going for her shots but committing 55 unforced errors and 9 double faults, against 23 winners and 5 aces. Ultimately, Safarovaâs experience and steady hand won her the match.  Keys, who was the lowest ranked player at No. 455 left in the womenâs draw, earned a wild card into the tournament by winning an eight-player playoff in College Park, Md. She would have been the youngest player to reach the final 32 since 2005, when Nicole Vaidisova, who retired from the sport last year at 21, reached the fourth round.  Keys has trained at Chris Evertâs Tennis Academy in Boca Raton, and Friday is the 40-year-anniversary of Evertâs first-ever win at the Open, which came when she was just three months older than Keys is now.  Safarovaâs section of the draw is wide open, and after outlasting Keys, sheâll have some confidence moving forward.  Sheâll face the 23-year-old Romanian, Monica Niculescu, who is ranked 68th and has never won a round in the main draw of the Open in four attempts.
