Jurgen Klinsmann has made his roster selections for the United States national team’s upcoming friendlies against Honduras and Ecuador, and regardless of how you feel about his squad, this week’s curated list of televised games features Yanks who made the cut. All games this weekend. All times Eastern. All emphasis American. Saturday 7:30 a.m.: Itâs New Jerseyâs own Tim Howard. Itâs the Merseyside Derby featuring Everton and Liverpool (ESPN2). And itâs another great opportunity to see Americaâs first-choice goalkeeper facing a powerful offense in a high-stakes English Premier League contest. (Even if you donât give a hoot about Howard, itâs hard to pass up a chance to watch Liverpoolâs Luis SuÃ¡rez do his thing. 9:30 a.m.: Eager to get a glimpse of first-time call-up Danny Williams? Youâre in luck. Williams, the 21-year-old Hoffenheim midfielder, will suit up against the Bundesliga powerhouse Bayern Munich in a live match broadcast on GolTV. Actually, suit up may not be the right expression, as Williams has made only two appearances for Hoffenheim this season, both as a substitute. But as the only real surprise on Klinsmannâs roster, plenty of folks will be eager to see if Williams 1) sees game action and 2) makes a positive impression. 7:30 p.m.: Was Rafa Marquez taking a dig at Tim Ream and Juan Agudelo when he told reporters that he was a better player than his teammates? If so, that bold — and suspension-worthy — declaration didnât deter Klinsmann from calling up the two youngsters. Expect to see both Ream and Agudelo in action as the Red Bulls try to cling to an M.L.S. playoff spot in their match with Toronto (Fox Soccer Channel). 9:45 p.m.: Itâs two-for-one night in this Mexican Primera Division contest, as Michael Orozco Fiscal and San Luis battle DaMarcus Beasley and Puebla (Galavision). Orozco, who has not made much of an impression in his recent callups for the national team, appears to be a beneficiary of Klinsmannâs decision to give players a chance to jell: “One important thing is to see continuity in the build-up of our national team,” Klinsmann said Thursday. “We’d like to see new faces as well, but we also don’t want to shake up the core structure of the team too much.” Beasley, on the other hand, qualifies as one of the “new” faces on the squad despite his 93 caps. He has not kicked a ball in anger for the U.S. since his cameo against Algeria in the 2010 World Cup. 10:30 p.m.: Los Angeles vs. Real Salt Lake (M.L.S. Direct Kick; M.L.S. MatchDay Live). Kyle Beckerman wonât see any action in this match — and perhaps wonât see any M.L.S. action for a while — after this vicious head butt of Daniel Paladini. But expect Landon Donovan to be at the heart of the Galaxy attack as he tries to reclaim the M.L.S. goal-scoring lead from Dwayne De Rosario. As for Galaxy defender Omar Gonzalez, well, Klinsmann elected to call in the likes of Fiscal and Oguchi Onyewu instead. Weâll see how that works out. Sunday 10 a.m.: Fulham vs. Queens Park Rangers (foxsoccer.tv). Fulham needs a win, and when Fulham needs a win Clint Dempsey often comes to the rescue. It doesnât hurt that Fulham is at home, where the Cottagers play a confident, attacking style of soccer that brings out the best in Deuce. What will you be watching this weekend?
