Advertisement  AP The missing link to a four-bowl lineup that could give college football a national championship game may be filled Tuesday when representatives of the Cotton, Orange and Sugar bowls meet with four other bowls and officials of the Big East and Atlantic Coast conferences and Notre Dame. The plan envisioned by the three bowls is to create a situation where as many conference champions as possible can be paired in the post-season, possibly creating a national title game in one of them. Conference expansion triggered the move by the Cotton, Orange and Sugar bowls to try to form the four-bowl alliance because many of the available independent powers will be competing in a conference in 1992 or shortly thereafter -- Florida State in the Atlantic Coast Conference, Miami in the Big East and Penn State in the Big Ten. The Big East will crown a champion this year, but won't have a formal conference schedule. John T. Bell, executive director of the Gator Bowl, says he will present a proposal to become the fourth bowl in the alliance. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
