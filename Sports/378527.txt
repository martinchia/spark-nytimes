Mike Tanier will provide Bats with updates on less than important developments from the World Series. Most of baseballâs greatest plays take place in the outfield: home runs, doubles in the gap, diving catches. Even a play at the plate usually starts with a great throw from 300 feet away. But in Game 5, some of the most memorable moments occurred inside the base paths: Rafael Furcalâs third-inning bunt single: The Rangers’ C. J. Wilson slipped coming off the mound, barehanded the ball, and tried to flick it to first base. First baseman Mitch Moreland had to chase it to the right-field wall, where he attempted to scoop it after a pop-up slide, only to drop it. Everyone gets 5 points deducted for attempting to look slick. Furcal is awarded second base. Elvis Andrusâs bunt single: It entered a wormhole in space and time that exists somewhere about 15 feet to the left of the pitcherâs mound. David Freese followed it at a slow, frustrated trot for 20 feet, like a dog walker waiting for a recalcitrant poodle to do its bidding on a neighborâs lawn. Then, exasperated, he scooped.  Rafael Furcalâs fifth-inning sacrifice: Adrian Beltre fielded it and prepared to fire to third base. Except that Beltre is the third baseman. It was a rotation play, with the shortstop covering second, the second baseman covering first, and the first baseman guarding against a right-side bunt. Itâs a good thing Beltre remembered at the last possible second. Watch the replay, and you can see Cardinals third-base coach Jose Oquendo square up as if he is ready to field the throw. He is a crafty one. Nick Punto’s attempting to break his bat after David Murphyâs great inning-ending catch: Technically, he appeared to be trying to bend the bat, using only the power of his mind. The bat should not have been held accountable for Murphyâs fine play. Chris Carpenterâs fielding error on Ian Kinslerâs dribbler: Well, that explains why Carpenter did not make an effort on Andrusâs bunt: he might have kicked it halfway to Fort Worth. There has been some magnificent fielding in this series. There have also been some outtakes from Rowan Atkinson films. Albert Pujolsâs facial expression before Allen Craig is thrown out stealing second base. His shoulders drop. His lips purse. He wishes he can blame someone else for the hit-and-run call, but apparently it was his decision. The only person who would order someone to run into an out with Albert Pujols at the plate is Albert Pujols. Tony La Russaâs reaction to Murphyâs eighth-inning infield single. Eyes bugging and hands clutching his cap, La Russa looked like a fan for a moment. Everything about that play was baseball beautiful: Puntoâs sudden change of direction as the ball ricocheted off the pitcherâs leg, his desperate effort to barehand the ball, Murphyâs charge up the line. This may be remembered as the World Series that was won and lost in the infield. Or as the World Series that was lost to land-line static. Has this ever happened to you? âHi, this is Tony. I need Rzepczynski and Motte to warm up.â Got it. Rzepczynski to warm up. âYes. And Motte.â No problem. Rzepczynski will be ready to go in a minute or two. âWhat about Motte?â Iâm sorry, sir. There is some noise behind you. As if you are at an athletic contest and people are cheering. Did you want someone besides Rzepczynski? âYes! Jason Motte!â Lance Lynn? I am sorry but all of these names sound the same. âWhat? Lynn sounds nothing like Motte. And nothing sounds like Rzepczynski!â Rzepczynski? Why didnât you say so? He is warming up now. If so, try these troubleshooting tips to improve interdepartment communications at your company: 1)Â Â Â Â Â  If you are on a land line, check all of the cord connections to your receiver and to the wall. Of course, we realize that if you are on a land line, it means you are either a great-grandparent, a manager making a pitching change, or a “Matrix” character desperately trying to escape the Smiths, so you may not have time for all of this fussy troubleshooting. 2)Â Â Â Â Â  Have you considered speaking louder and more slowly? That always works when trying to order cheese fries overseas. 3)Â Â Â Â Â  You know, that bullpen is only a few hundred feet away. And you are surrounded by professional athletes, one of whom could relay your message by jogging over there in a few seconds. 4)Â Â Â Â Â  Tweet your bullpen choices. A fan above the bullpen who follows you can then shout your instructions down to the pitchers. 5)Â Â Â Â Â  Perhaps hire some assistants who can think and operate autonomously. You know, someone who can anticipate that you want the right-handed setup man with the 2.25 E.R.A. who you used 78 times to be warmed up in the eighth inning when a right-handed slugger is due up late in the inning. 6)Â Â Â Â Â  If the miscommunication does result in improper bullpen usage and a lost World Series game, do not blame the phones, the crowd noise, or your assistants. Simply glower at the press pool Bill Belichick-style, fall back on your unpredictable genius reputation, and say, âI played a hunch.â That way, columnists will give you some mystical sage benefit of the doubt, instead of making fun of you as if you were a guy who couldnât get his order straight at a drive-thru window.
