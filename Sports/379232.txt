Brandon League blew three consecutive save chances in May (and absorbed four losses in four straight outings) but still has 20 saves on the year, one off the league lead. The Mariners are likely to generate more save situations than the average team because their pitcher-friendly park, strong starting staff, solid defense and terrible offense ensure that many of their wins are by small margins. League doesnât strike out too many batters (20 in 30 2/3 innings), but he has walked only five, keeps the ball on the ground (2-to-1 ground-ball-to-fly-ball ratio) and averages 96 miles per hour on his fastball. He came out of Tuesdayâs loss in Washington after a line drive hit him on the leg and could miss some time.

Trevor Cahill went from a seven-walk, zero-strikeout disaster start on June 14 to an eight-inning, one-walk, seven-strikeout gem on Sunday. You can usually predict what stars like Roy Halladay and Justin Verlander will do on one end, and how players like Joe Saunders and Rodrigo Lopez will fare on the other. The 90 percent of pitchers in between can pretty much do anything on a given day. Sometimes itâs best to get the cheapest ones applicable to your league and spend nearly all your resources on hitting. Josh Beckett missed a home start against the Padres because of an illness. Thatâs like missing a month in terms of expected value. Of course, if youâre a Beckett owner, you can comfort yourself with the Cahill example. Tim Hudson of the Braves may have played one of the greatest regular-season games ever Monday night. Not only did he pitch eight scoreless innings of two-hit, one-walk ball, he struck out eight and drove in the gameâs only runs with a two-run homer. I realize pitchers have thrown no-hitters and perfect games, but a two-run homer against a very tough Ricky Romero has to be worth more than three stranded base runners. Put differently, there havenât been a lot of outings in modern major-league history that gave oneâs team a better chance to win than eight scoreless innings, three base runners allowed and a two-run homer. [Editorâs note: On June 23, 1971, Rick Wise of the Phillies threw a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds and hit two homers, driving in three of Philadelphiaâs four runs.]
 Zack Greinke of the Brewers has 80 strikeouts against 9 walks and a 4.77 earned run average in 60 1/3 innings. His problem? Heading into his start Tuesday against Tampa Bay, a .383 batting average on balls in play, a .593 strand rate and seven home runs allowed. Jeff Erickson and I talked with Yahoo! Sportsâs Brad Evans about this on our Sirius XM show Monday, and decided that while much of Greinkeâs showing is undoubtedly due to bad luck, itâs likely he is also throwing too many strikes in the wrong situations. All things being equal, itâs better to walk fewer batters, but if the hitter knows youâre not going to throw him a ball, it has to make his job easier. As with Ricky Nolasco (and Kevin Slowey in years past), the strikeout-to-walk numbers are fantastic, but at what cost? Few can be Roy Halladay, so precise with location of strikes that they can get away with it. For most pitchers, might there be a BB/9 number (say 2.0) below which they should not go?
