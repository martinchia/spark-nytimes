The draft is three months away, and the NFL Network analyst Mike Mayock has unveiled his opening rankings on the top five draft prospects at each position. First, a look back at his quarterback ratings last year at this time. Like many analysts, he underestimated Cam Newton. By April, though, Mayock moved Newton up to No. 2, still behind Blaine Gabbert,Â and added Christian Ponder into a tie with Andy Dalton for fifth, dropping down Ricky Stanzi, Colin Kaepernick and Pat Devlin. This season, he’s waiting for more information, declining to specify his Nos. 4 and 5 quarterbacks. 2011 Quarterback List
