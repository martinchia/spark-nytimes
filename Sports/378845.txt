Stunning upsets, close and gritty battles and a few routs marked the first round of The Times’s fantasy United States Open Tournament, with the thoughts of modern technology and big serves resonating with voters. Chris Evert and Jimmy Connors once owned the Open, and New York for that matter. But in the first round, both fell in upsets. Evert, the top seed in the women’s draw, who won the Open six times, was ousted by No. 8 Justine Henin, who collected 53 percent of the vote to 47 percent for Evert.  Who are the two greatest Open champions of the past 30 years? Itâs up to you to decide, with a little help from The Timesâs tennis experts. Watch our video debates and vote on the winner. Ross from Delaware commented: “Henin was used to facing rocket serves from the Williams sisters and others and successfully dealing with that. Chris just rolled it in (with placement not power), and Henin would have been able to break her quite often. While Chris had a great slice backhand, she rarely if ever hit a topspin backhand which was a major weapon for Henin. Over all, Justine had too many weapons and too much desire for Chris to beat her consistently.” That kind of talk rankled the Evert supporters, like Jim R. from Seattle, who wrote: “Looking at the vote totals, it is clear that Chris Evert is woefully underappreciated and her skills underrated. Her uber-feminine persona (especially in the the early days) belied a tough competitor and an individual who returned shots off both wings with the force of a cannon and the precision of a laser…….just ask Martina, Billie Jean, Margaret Court or even Steffi Graf. Before you cast a vote for Henin, watch a few YouTube clips of Evert playing just about anyone…….she wasn’t playing patty-cake……she was throwing left and right hooks.” Connors, the third seed on the men’s side and the owner of five Open titles, fell to Rafael Nadal, 46 percent to 54. John Franco of California wrote, “I loved Conners, and he was absolutely dominant in his early days, crushing Rosewall in the finals of the US Open while barely breaking a sweat, but Rafa would have eaten him up. He’s stronger, quicker, even more relentless, and he would have destroyed Jimmy’s serve. 7-5, 6-2, 6-1. On clay it wouldn’t be that close.” And then there was Liz of Raleigh, N.C., who sounded as if she may have been in the upper deck during some of Connors’s Open triumphs. “Cmon! Jimmy Connors – at the US Open, in New York City, on hardcourts beats Rafa.” In the other women’s first-round matches, No. 2 Steffi Graf collected the most votes (1,496) to oust Venus Williams (84 percent to 16); No. 3 Martina Navratilova, with the highest vote percentage on the women’s side (87), beat Kim Clijsters; and No. 4 Serena Williams received 56 percent of the vote to defeat Monica Seles. The men’s top seed, Roger Federer, had the highest percentage of votes over all with 89 in eliminating Stefan Edberg; No. 2 Pete Sampras dispatched Ivan Lendl, 79 percent to 21; and No. 4 John McEnroe edged No. 5 Andre Agassi, 52 percent to 48, in the closest first-round match. Voting for the women’s semifinals is now open, with Henin playing Navratilova and Graf meeting Serena Williams. The men’s voting will begin on Wednesday, with Federer paired against Nadal (where have we seen this before?) and McEnroe meeting Sampras. Cast your vote and join the debate. Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
