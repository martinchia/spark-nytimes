Sometimes you got to bet on yourself, or so thought Cot Campbell one day last winter when he was assessing the strength of his Dogwood Stable, one of the pioneers in horse racing partnerships.  Campbell has learned about selling the sizzle over the course of an eclectic life that has included stints as the master of ceremonies at a water ski show; a sportswriter; an apprentice mortician; an advertising copywriter; and an author. He titled his autobiography âMemoirs of a Longshotâ and decided to go searching for a big score himself. âI woke up feeling kind of feisty and I decided to try to lay $5,000 at juicy odds that Dogwood Stable would win a Breedersâ Cup race in 2011,â Campbell said. âAt the time, Aikenite was training quite well, and we had some young horses that I thought could be special.â He found a taker in Luckyâs Race and Sports Book in Reno. Lucky’s took its time. âIâm sure the Sports Book did a little due diligence work on the stable to make sure I wasnât in the process of buying some superstar,â he said. âI got 10-1 odds,â he said. âIt should have been 50-1!â Campbell is correct â he should have shopped for higher odds, as the road to the Breedersâ Cup is a rugged one. Dogwoodâs 2-year-olds never blossomed, but he does have Aikenite in the $1.5 million Sprint on Saturday at Churchill Downs. Aikenite will break from the No. 3 post at odds of 8-1. âIâm not spending the $50,000 yet, but weâve got a shot, and this is the kind of thing that makes life delicious,â Campbell said. âAll of us in racing have got to be a little crazy, or we wouldnât be in it.â The Rail, with Joe Drape, The New York Times's horse racing reporter, and others from the racing community, gives readers a look at the race for the Triple Crown.
