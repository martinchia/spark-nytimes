As if there could be any doubt, Rex Ryan is the focal point of Giants-Jets week. He seems to be part coach, part boxing promoter, part team psychologist. He probably also sees himself as an entertainer. Â Tom Coughlin is not that; he’s a coach. On Monday, Â Coughlin was asked if he had ever talked trash as a player or a coach: “No,” he said. “Not that I would admit to.” On Monday, Ryan said of the rivalry with the Giants, via Ben Shpigel:  âThereâs no way Iâm going to be second fiddle,” and added: âTo say that a teamâs better than you that never made the playoffs is ridiculous. Clearly, we were the better team my first two years here. And we get to prove it on Saturday who the best team is this year.â During his Tuesday session with reporters, Ryan was asked about his remarks. The full transcript is available at the Jets’ Web site:  “You better believe that youâre better than your opponent. Thatâs how I believe every week. It sometimes doesnât work out that way, but I think in this case itâs pretty well noted that I came in here, when I got this job, I want to be the team that people talk about. I want to be the better team. Thereâs no question about it and when you look at it the first two years. I love the deal, where we’re going to dismiss that. Why would you dismiss it? Facts are facts.
Iâve only been here three years now. So Iâve mentioned from the whole time since I got here that I want to be best team and expect to be the best team for the next 10 years. I recognize the rich tradition of Giant football, thereâs no question. And Iâm not trying to take a run at the Giants or a shot at the Giants. I want to be the best team in the National Football League, and the fact that we share the same stadium, the same state, both New York teams, I donât want to be the one that is not looked at as the best team in my own state, thereâs no way. I want to be the best team, period.
Now, do I have the courage to say it? Absolutely. And if it doesnât happen and we get beat by the Giants, Iâll be the first one to tip my hat to them. Thereâs no question. But do I believe, in my heart, that weâre the better football team? Yes. Did I believe we were the better team two years ago and last year? Yes. So Iâll stand by everything Iâve ever said.” He later added: “I know itâs going to fall on one person, and thatâs the way it should be. Itâs coming right on top of me, and thatâs fine. And when we win, itâll be about the Jets, and thatâs where I want the attention to be. If we lose, itâs coming right down on me, and I can handle it. I hope I donât have to.” That was a tip-off that Ryan also seemed to be playing a game through the news media: taking pressure off his players by putting it on himself, as he has done before. In an interview on ESPN New York 1050,Â Mark Sanchez,Â while acknowledging that Ryan gives other teams incentive to beat the Jets,  said: “Thatâs encouraging as a player to know that your coach has that kind of confidence in you. And heâs willing to say anything to help us accomplish our goals and win games.â Extra point If Ryan is attempting to deflect the spotlight from his players, it’s hard to judge how effective he might be. But if you, as a fan, are feeling that Ryan’s act is becoming a little stale, do you think the players might be feeling the same way?
