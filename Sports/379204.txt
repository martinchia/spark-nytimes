 LOS ANGELES — Clayton Kershaw pitched his first career no-hitter Wednesday night, striking out a career-high 15 and allowing his only base runner on a throwing error by shortstop Hanley Ramirez in the Los Angeles Dodgers’ 8-0 victory over the Colorado Rockies. Kershaw’s performance gave the Dodgers the only two no-hitters in the major leagues this season. Josh Beckett threw one on May 25 in Philadelphia. “I am so amazed,” Kershaw said. “Beckett told me he was going to teach me how to do that, so I have Josh to thank.” Kershaw (7-2) retired his first 18 batters before Corey Dickerson led off the seventh with a slow grounder to short. Ramirez’s throw on the run went wide past first baseman Adrian Gonzalez for a two-base error, ending any chance for a perfect game.

That was all the Rockies would get against Kershaw, a two-time Cy Young award winner in the National League. Ramirez was back in the lineup after leaving Tuesday night’s game with a bruised ring finger on his throwing hand, the result of a sharp grounder by Dickerson. He was replaced on defense by rookie Carlos Triunfel to start the eighth.

Carl Erskine and Sal Maglie were the pitchers who allowed no hits in separate games that year. We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think. Go to Home Page »
