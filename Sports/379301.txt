In November, 2006, Chris Capuano and Chris Young, two well-educated young pitchers, were teammates on a major league All-Star team traveling in Japan. The two bonded on that trip, have remained friends since, and are now close to being reunited in Flushing on what could be baseballâs smartest pitching staff.  The Mets, who signed Capuano earlier this month, are on the verge of signing Young, a 6-foot-10, 280-pound right-hander  with a history of shoulder troubles, to a one-year deal, according to two major league executives who had been informed of the negotiations. The deal will not be completed, though, until Young passes a physical, which is expected to happen Tuesday, one of the executives said.  Young is  a Princeton graduate who wrote his senior thesis on the effect of Jackie Robinsonâs breaking baseballâs color barrier on the mainstream news media. He would  join Capuano, a Duke graduate and member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, as well as the bookish R. A. Dickey, an academic all-American at Tennessee, in the Metsâ academically inclined rotation.  Jon Niese and Mike Pelfrey are expected to fill out the five-man rotation to begin the season, and  Johan Santana should eventually return from shoulder surgery.   In Japan, Young and Capuano were teammates with two other Mets players, David Wright and Jose Reyes, who were playing just weeks after their disappointing loss in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series. But the thing that stood out most for Capuano was the impression Young, a forward for the Princeton basketball team, made on the locals.  âI remember walking behind him and his wife in Tokyo,â Capuano said in a recent interview. âThe people were watching in awe just at the size of him. But we had a great time together. Heâs a great guy, a real competitor and a great teammate.â  Capuano is now expected to follow Young somewhere in the Metsâ rotation, with the hope that fans and opposing teams are equally in awe of him as the Japanese citizenry was.  If last September is any indication, Young seems to have put his shoulder problems behind him. He made only four starts last season, but three of them came in September, when he went 1-0 with a 1.29 earned run average.  The San Diego Padres declined an option to re-sign him, and the Mets, who are appear to be looking for value in smart pitchers recovering from injury, pursued him virtually since the free-agency period began in November. ESPN New York first reported the deal was close to being completed.  Young is 48-34 over seven seasons with the Texas Rangers and the Padres with a 3.80 E.R.A. But after three straight seasons of making at least 30 starts and pitching at least 164 innings, he has made only 36 starts the last three years, averaging a little more than  66 innings per season.  The Mets have been using spacious Citi Field as a lure to pitchers with past arm troubles who are looking to prove they are recovered and deserving of long-term deals. Capuano and the recently signed reliever Taylor Buchholz are  coming off elbow surgery.
