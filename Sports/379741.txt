Brian Burke, a former Navy pilot who has taken up the less dangerous hobby of N.F.L. statistical analysis,   operates  Advanced NFL Stats, a blog about  football, math and human behavior.  No single position affects a teamâs fortunes more than quarterback. Several teams have changed quarterbacks this season, and for the most part, they have swapped one below-average thrower for another. But with Tony Romoâs injury, the Cowboys are certain to show a severe decline in their passing game. Romoâs career net yards per attempt (Y.P.A.) of 7.3 is remarkably high, and this season it was nearly as strong at 7.1, fourth in the league. Jon Kitnaâs career net Y.P.A. is 5.7, which includes his peak seasons as a starter, so something less than 5.7 may be more realistic. We canât say for sure how Kitna will perform in relief, but just to get a feel for the effect on the Cowboys, going from 7.3 to a 5.7 net YPA would, all other things being equal, take an 11-win team and turn it into a 6-win team. Dallas was certainly not on track for 11 wins this year, but the 5-game difference still gives us a sense of how important passing efficiency is. The Cowboys host the Jaguars this Sunday, and normally the prediction model would make Dallas a very heavy favorite based on their comparative efficiency stats. If we hypothetically plug in a 5.7 net Y.P.A. for the Cowboys’ passing efficiency, Dallas would still be the favorite, at 0.63 to Jacksonvilleâs 0.37.  Here are the rest of this weekâs game probabilities (updated to correct that Denver-San Francisco is a neutral-site game, at London). Brian explained how his predictions work in this post.
