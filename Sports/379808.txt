Michael Gearon Jr., part of the Atlanta Thrashersâ ownership group, said last Wednesday that there was a âsense of urgencyâ over the long-futile search for new investors in the club, which according to court documents has lost more than $130 million since 2005. Gearon said if investors were not found, the Thrashers could be sold and moved. On Friday, Gearon took a step back and said the clubâs owners were ânot hitting the panic button,â but the word is out, and fans in Quebec City and Winnipeg are excited at the prospect. The Thrashers, 28th in the league in reported attendance, are dropping in the standings. They have made the playoffs once in their 11-season existence, in 2007, when they were swept by the Rangers.
