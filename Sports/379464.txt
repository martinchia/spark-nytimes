In an Egyptian Cup match on Tuesday, Amir Sayoud of Al Ahly seemed to stub his toe then trip comically before nudging the ball toward the Kima Aswan goal. No matter, Al Ahly won the game, 4-0. As the Guardian points out, Al Ahly’s Algerian midfielder was shown a yellow card for an illegal penalty kick. He probably should have been sent off for sheer stupidity.  O.K. We know there have been hundreds of poorly taken penalty kicks in the history of the game. But it would be hard to top this one.
