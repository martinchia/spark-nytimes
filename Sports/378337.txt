Advertisement  The fans here still do not know how to spell their coach's name. The Phoenix Cardinals players are rallying around Joe Bugel, trying to prevent the owner, Bill Bidwill, from dismissing him, but several signs at Sun Devil Stadium this afternoon read, "Keep Bugle." Defeating the Giants today, 17-6, was a start. "We haven't been playing with our top guns this year," said linebacker Eric Hill, referring to injuries that sidelined safeties Chuck Cecil and John Booty, wide receiver Gary Clark and running back Garrison Hearst. "Bill Bidwill needs to take that into consideration before he makes an irrational decision. Joe Bugel is the right man for the job." Bugel's best move last week was reading the newspapers. He saw where Giants running back Dave Meggett verbally accosted his quarterback, Steve Beuerlein, and then he re-read the quotes to his players. "Meggett better keep his head on a swivel," one Cardinals special-teams player, who wasn't identified, was quoted by The Arizona Republic as saying before the game. Meggett, it turned out, was not beheaded, nor were there any cheap shots. "Absolutely nothing, no extracurricular activities, no nothing," Meggett said. The Cardinals simply made tackles. "I felt like I was back in Washington," said former Redskins receiver, Clark. "We played the best football team out there and dominated them."
