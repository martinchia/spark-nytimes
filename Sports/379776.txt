Advertisement  Steve Spurrier, who led Florida to a 9-2 finish in his first season as coach at the Southeastern Conference school, was given a two-year contract extension yesterday that will expire after the 1997 season. The Gators compiled a league-best 6-1 record in the S.E.C. but were ineligible to win the conference title and participate in a bowl game because of National Collegiate Athletic Association sanctions resulting from violations occurring under the former coach, Galen Hall.
