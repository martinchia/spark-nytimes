Hampden Park is hailed as the spiritual home of Scottish soccer, the place where some say modern soccer was truly born, the place where legends such as Pele and Diego Maradona admitted to being astonished by the famous “Hampden Roar,” but this historic stadium in Glasgowâs south side could now be just as conclusively defined as a soothing buffer zone in one of sportâs fiercest rivalries. After the fury and indignation of the previous showdowns between the Old Firm rivals Celtic and Rangers, Hampden Parkâs calming influence as the site of Sunday’s League Cup final quieted the seething feud which has characterized the rivalry of late. Scotlandâs shame of three weeks ago — a bare-knuckle fight of a game that featured 3 red cards, 13 yellows and 34 fan arrests — was replaced by a captivating showpiece fitting for such an occasion. (The strict warnings issued to the players by the police and even the Catholic church probably didn’t hurt either.) The Croatian striker Nikica Jelavic scored an extra-time winner to give Rangers a 2-1 victory, and a refreshing abnormality — relative tranquility — was the order of the day. That allowed the quality of the play to take precedence over the off-the-field matters that have threatened to undermine the sport in Scotland. Familiarity often breeds apathy, but when it comes to Rangers and Celtic, no such indifference exists. This will be the 26th consecutive season that either Rangers or Celtic will win the league title. Blanket news media coverage and intense scrutiny of their meetings (Sundayâs was their sixth this season) hint at no such waning of interest. But with both the Scottish Cup and Sunday’s currently titled Co-Operative Insurance Cup set to lead a sponsorship-less existence next season, is Scotland growing weary of the Old Firm? Neutrals may insist that the Old Firm’s influence on Scottish soccer is a negative one. Ancient religious allegiances dictate that the games take on an added significance, with statistics showing that on the night of an Old Firm clash, violent crimes committed in Glasgow increase dramatically, with cases of domestic violence rising as much as 140 percent. Some say Scotland would be better off without them. But the unfortunate truth for the Scottish Premier League and Scottish soccer as a whole is that without the Old Firm, quality, interest and — perhaps most crucially — income would severely handicap the development of the game in the country. The Old Firm is undoubtedly Scottish soccerâs most valuable asset. Rupert Murdochâs BSkyB television network and ESPN pay a combined fee of Â£65 million (about $105 million) annually in their five-year deal to broadcast S.P.L. games. However, subtract the Old Firm, and more specifically, the Old Firm clashes, from that equation and Scottish soccer would be deemed almost worthless by organizations whose sole intention is to attract the highest possible viewing figures. This is not to say that outside of Glasgow, Scottish soccer is worthless. The days of genuine challenges to the Old Firm supremacy from the so-called New Firm (Aberdeen and Dundee United) may be a relic of bygone days, but admirable seasons from Hearts and Kilmarnock have provided an entertaining sideshow to the disproportionate conflict between Celtic and Rangers. Kilmarnockâs attractive style has earned them many admirers, and their Finnish manager, Mixu Paatelainen, has generated a blueprint for others wishing to deviate from the “hoof-and-hunt” style for which Scottish soccer is maligned. Jim Jefferies’s Hearts have also displayed their ability to entertain this season, even pushing to split the Old Firm for the first time in five years. The likelihood of such a split has all but vanished now, but Hearts have benefited from a year of stability under the clubâs frequently erratic Lithuanian owner, Vladimir Romanov. Clubs such as Kilmarnock and Hearts are among those campaigning for change in the sportâs set-up in Scotland, and league reconstruction remains an urgent issue. But with the fallout from the Scottish Cup skirmish between Celtic Manager Neil Lennon and a Rangers assistant, Ally McCoist, still raw, talk of change has dissipated to be superseded by the criticisms angled at the Old Firm by prominent soccer figures, politicians and even religious leaders. Strathclyde police even floated the far-fetched notion of banning the Old Firm from playing one another before rationality returned. As absurd as this suggestion sounded, it was indicative of an attitude maintained by those outside the Old Firm ring. Scotland pretends to hate the Old Firm, but without them, would the country miss them? I suspect it would. Graham Ruthven is a student at the University of Stirling in Scotland.
