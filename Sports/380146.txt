Advertisement  The Mets and Yankees announced yesterday that their weekend series of two exhibition games in New York would be played on the weekend before the delayed baseball season starts, one week later than planned. The teams will meet in Shea Stadium at 1:35 P.M. on Saturday, April 7, and in Yankee Stadium at 1:30 P.M. on Sunday, April 8. Tickets already sold will be honored at the games, which were scheduled one week earlier before the baseball lockout disrupted spring training. The teams have played each other a total of 80 times, with the Yankees holding a lead of 46 games to 33 with one tie. In spring training games, the Yankees hold a 34-25 edge. The teams resumed relations last year after a lapse of six years and played six games, four in Florida and two in New York on the weekend before the season opened. The Yankees won both those games, 4-3 and 4-0. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
