Urban Meyer will step down as coach of the Florida Gators, the second time he has made such a proclamation in as many seasons, but this time, it appears definitive. âI have been a Division I football coach for the last 25 years and, during that time, my primary focus has been helping my teams win titles,â Meyer said in a statement issued by the University of Florida. âI have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it, and I am a fierce competitor to my core. At this time in my life, however, I appreciate the sacrifices my 24/7 profession has demanded of me, and I know it is time to put my focus on my family and life away from the field. The decision to step down was a difficult one.” A news conference was scheduled for 6 p.m. E.S.T. on Wednesday with the school’s president, Bernie Machen, the athletic director, Jeremy Foley, Meyer and several Florida players. Meyer, 46, coached Florida for six seasons and won two Bowl Championship Series national titles.
