 D.C. United increased its lead to 5 points in Major League Soccer’s Eastern Conference with a 2-1 victory over the San Jose Earthquakes on Friday night in Santa Clara, Calif. Eddie Johnson and Luis Silva each scored in the first half, and Bill Hamid made two late saves to give D.C. its third straight win on the road. Johnson converted a penalty to give United a 1-0 lead in the 12th minute. It was awarded after Chris Rolfe’s shot hit Brandon Barklage’s extended left hand inside the penalty area. Silva added to United’s lead in the 25th minute with his sliding touch of Rolfe’s cross. The Earthquakes’ Chris Wondolowski scored on a deflected shot in the 39th minute in his first appearance since playing for the United States at the World Cup in Brazil. ■ The Belgium international defender Sébastien Pocognoli signed a three-year deal with West Bromwich Albion of England’s Premier League.
