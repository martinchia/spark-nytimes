Advertisement  AP The International Olympic Committee plans to meet formally with government and sports leaders in South Africa for the first time since the I.O.C. expelled the racially divided nation more than 20 years ago. One anti-apartheid leader called the move among the most significant steps yet toward ending South Africa's international sports' isolation. Another held out the possibility of South African athletes competing in the 1992 Olympics, but stressed that a final decision would depend on how the rest of Africa viewed reforms by the Pretoria government. The I.O.C.'s executive board took the action at the first day of its meeting in Lillehammer, Norway, where the 1994 Winter Olympics will be staged. The I.O.C. accepted a proposal by its special commission on apartheid in sports to send a five-member delegation to Johannesburg in April, the first time since South Africa was expelled in a meeting in Amsterdam in 1970 that I.O.C. members have officially contacted South Africa.

"They want to see what is what. They want the full view of the situation. It is among the most dramatic developments."  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.
