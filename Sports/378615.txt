SEATTLE â Mariano Rivera has done many things in baseball, from recording 600 saves to starting games and even batting. But he has never played center field. Rivera, who claims to be a viable center fielder, has made it clear that playing the position for one game is something he would love to do before he retires, and on Wednesday Yankees Manager Joe Girardi indicated he would like to find a way to make it happen. âItâs something I would definitely think about,â Girardi said. But it would be very difficult to find a way to do it. The risk of a possible injury and the potential that Rivera might make a costly mistake make it hard to find the right conditions for it to happen. It would have to be a meaningless game, but the Yankees almost never have any of those. Girardi said that if Rivera ever told him he is retiring, he would consider doing it toward the end of a season. But even in that situation, the Yankees are usually preparing for the postseason, and it would be inconceivable to endanger such a valuable player prior to the playoffs by letting him sprint around in the outfield. Rivera shags fly balls almost every day. âHeâs incredible,â Girardi said. Girardi joked that he might get Rivera into the outfield for one batter. âA guy who hits ground balls or strikes out a lot,â Girardi said.
