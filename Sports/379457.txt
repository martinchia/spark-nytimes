Advertisement  Tommy Lasorda might end his 43-year association with the Los Angeles Dodgers and become manager of the Giants if they move to St. Petersburg, Fla., a published report says. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, citing two people close to the situation, reported yesterday that Lasorda could join the Giants before the 1993 season and manage at least one season before becoming general manager. Under the scenario, the former Texas Rangers manager Bobby Valentine, who was fired July 9, would become Lasorda's third-base coach, then take over as manager when Lasorda moves into the front office. Lasorda, 64 years old, has a close relationship with Vincent Piazza, one of the main investors in the group that has reached an agreement in principle to buy the San Francisco Giants from Bob Lurie. Lasorda is the godfather of Piazza's son Mike, a catching prospect in the Dodgers' system. "There's nothing to that," Lasorda said yesterday in Atlanta. "I'm manager of the Dodgers. I have a contract for 1993. I don't want anyone getting in touch with me."

Advertisement Despite a growing rift between Lasorda and members of the front office, the club in March extended his contract through the 1993 season, which would be his 18th as Dodgers manager. White Sox Lose Another Shortstop White Sox shortstop Craig Grebeck returned to Chicago yesterday to have his broken right foot examined. He is expected to miss four to six weeks. The White Sox lost their All-Star shortstop, Ozzie Guillen, for the season on April 21 with torn ligaments in his right knee. Grebeck removed himself from Saturday night's game against the Angels in Anaheim, Calif., after hearing a crack in his right foot as he ran out a grounder in the fifth inning. He had returned to the lineup Friday after missing six games after being hit on the foot by a pitch July 31.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Oakland's Walkman A's outfielder Jose Canseco tied a major league record by drawing walks in seven consecutive times at bat, five times on Tuesday and his first two appearances Wednesday night against Texas. He nearly broke the record, going to 3-0 in his third at-bat against Bobby Witt before taking two called strikes, then swinging and missing at a low slider that would have been ball four. In his seven walks, Canseco swung the bat only three times.

On a Roll White Sox outfielder Lance Johnson went 2 for 5 yesterday and extended his hitting streak to 23 games.

Those Streaking Tigers Tigers Manager Sparky Anderson, impressed that Milwaukee rookie Cal Eldred shut out Minnesota on Saturday, made a strange promise. "I couldn't imagine shutting out the Twins. Every time we play them, they have guys running all over the place. If we ever did shut out the Twins, I'd take off my clothes and run naked on the field." Although Anderson did keep his clothes on yesterday at Tiger Stadium, a 22-year-old Canadian ran naked through right field during the fifth inning. The man, whose name was not released, was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.
