Advertisement  RAY LeBLANC, goaltending hero for the United States Olympic team in France, will get his one-game reward tonight when he appears in net for the Blackhawks in Chicago against the San Jose Sharks. "Everyone needs that one little break to get into the National Hockey League," LeBlanc said yesterday. "I've got that break now. It's up to me to take advantage of this." Blackhawks General Manager BOB PULFORD, who is not interested in retaining the minor league goaltender, had promised LeBlanc one full game in goal, so that he would be eligible for the N.H.L. expansion draft in June. The home game against the Sharks represents the lowest-risk commitment, while affording LeBlanc his first appearance in the league. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
