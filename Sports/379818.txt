GREENBURGH, N.Y. — Mike DâAntoniâs eyes lighted up when asked to describe Blake Griffinâs athleticism. In doing so, he used the word unbelievable, stretching it in a way to make Griffinâs athleticism sound even more, well, unbelievable. If there was a launching point in Griffinâs ascension as dunking sensation, it arrived on Nov. 20 when the Knicks visited the Clippers and Griffin used them as props in his personal dunk contest. There was the spin move at full speed to free himself from Danilo Gallinari followed by a thunderous dunk. There were the finishes over Timofey Mozgov, one in which Griffin palmed the back of Mozgovâs head with one hand as he rose over him and dunked the ball with the other. “The guyâs a human highlight film and heâs un-buh-leev-able,â DâAntoni gushed. âIt just happened to be Timmy that time. It could have been anybody. Heâs one of the best and heâs really one of the highest jumpers Iâve ever seen.â  The Griffin highlight show comes to Madison Square Garden for the first time on Wednesday night. In the November game, Amarâe Stoudemire raised his eyebrows toward Griffin, an acknowledgment from one dunker to another. Stoudemire first saw Griffin when he hosted him at his camp when Griffin was a freshman in college. Griffin was then more of a fundamental player rather than a future slam-dunk artist. âHeâs a better rebounder than I was, I am,â Stoudemire said. âHeâs a much better rebounder. He gets great position. The athleticism is similar and the way we play is similar. But heâs a better rebounder, for sure.â The message the Knicks pointed out at Tuesdayâs practice is that a dunk, no matter its flashiness or emasculation to the victim, is stillÂ  worth only 2 points. The Knicks won the first meeting, despite Griffinâs 44 points and YouTube-ready flushes. “I keep telling everybody,â Gallinari said. âEverybody keeps asking me about that dunk. We won the game. Thatâs all I remember.â The impressions on Mozgov may run deeper, and DâAntoni said that Mozgov may have drifted into a funk afterward. Mozgov, the Knicksâ rookie center from Russia, played sparingly for more than two months after the game. He has since rebounded, barring a Griffin setback. Mozgov had 23 points and 14 rebounds against the Pistons on Jan. 30 and made his first start Sunday since Nov. 16. Mozgov will start Wednesday matched against Griffin. âI remember the whole thing,â Mozgov said. “I remember it.â âI donât want it to happen again,â he added. âIâll try to be there fast, be there earlier on my spot to be a good defender.â Of late, defenders are playing Griffin more physically in an attempt to avoid being the backdrop of any highlight plays. DâAntoni said the Knicks would not adopt that approach. âI think youâve got to be very careful about that,â DâAntoni said. âI think you should outskill him and outplay him and outhustle him and outposition him.â
