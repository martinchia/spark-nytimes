The Los Angeles Dodgers asked a federal bankruptcy court judge Tuesday to approve the agreement to sell the team reached last month with Major League Baseball.  The motion filed by the team â on the eve of a hearing in court on Wednesday â is a formality but provides some details of the agreement not made public.  The treaty between the team and baseball ended months of hostility between the Dodgersâ owner, Frank McCourt, and Commissioner Bud Selig that enlivened documents filed with the court.   According to the motion, which will be heard on Dec. 27:  McCourt does not have to sell the parking lots and surrounding land at Dodger Stadium. He is only required to rent their use to the new buyer. But potential buyers can bid for the assets, which are owned by a McCourt subsidiary. M.L.B. must stay neutral in the dispute between the Dodgers and Fox Sports, whose Prime Ticket channel has a contract to carry the teamâs games through 2013. Baseball must also withdraw any previous pleadings that backed Foxâs position against the Dodgers accelerating the process of selling the TV rights after 2013. Baseball cannot interfere in the teamâs control of the sale. In strong language, the Dodgers said in the filing that the agreement âprovides for the sale to be conducted in a manner that will be under the direction of the debtorsâ â the team â âand its financial advisorâ entirely to âmaximize value and not for any other purpose.â  Any disputes will be sent to a mediator. M.L.B. exerted substantial control of the sale, also out of bankruptcy court, of the Texas Rangers last year by Tom Hicks.
