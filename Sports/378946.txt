Advertisement By WILLIAM N. WALLACE As the Olympic Games approach -- the opening ceremonies are 19 days away -- some of the 10,000 competitors may be reflecting upon all the training they have done. One is NORM BELLINGHAM, a 27-year-old American kayak racer. "People don't realize how miserable training can become," Bellingham said the other day at Lake Placid, N.Y., where the United States team is training. "This past year has been so tough. I've been eating and sleeping the paddling. Every day when I come back from training I feel absolutely dead, like I had the flu, the whole body aching. Just as I begin to recover, it's time to do another hard workout." Bellingham, who will be competing at his third Olympics and was a gold medalist the last time, knows what the training is for. "I need something to show for my effort," he said. "People are not going to ask, 'How was your experience?' They want to know, 'What did you do? What did they hang around your neck?' I feel a responsibility to win a medal, the prettiest one I can." Bellingham, 6 feet 5 inches and 215 pounds, was once told by IAN FERGUSON of New Zealand, "If I had your body I'd win six gold medals." Ferguson won four with his own body.
