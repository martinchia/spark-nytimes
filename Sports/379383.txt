The comments by Giants defensive end Osi Umenyiora about General Manager Jerry Reese in an affidavit that will become part of the N.F.L. playersâ antitrust case against the league seemed as if it might signal the end of the playerâs relationship with the team. But Umenyiora, in a telephone interview Friday, said he would âabsolutelyâ welcome a return to the Giants. He also expressed concern over playing time on the Giantsâ crowded defensive line and acknowledged moving his belongings from his home in New Jersey. âI love my teammates,â said Umenyiora, who has been living in Atlanta. âThe owners of the team, Mr. Mara and Mr. Tisch, Iâm really cool with both of them; they came to the hospital when I was injured. Theyâre wonderful people. I donât have a beef with them per se. At the end of the day, theyâre going to have to make the best decision for them.â

Umenyiora, in an affidavit to be filed in federal court in Minnesota next month, said that Reese has not make good on an April 2008 promise to renegotiate his contract or to trade him to another team. Umenyiora was selected as a plaintiff in the Brady v. the N.F.L. antitrust case. On Friday, he sought to explain the statements not as an attack on the organization, but simply part of the playersâ legal case. The Giants said they had no comment. Umenyiora, 29, who has two years remaining on a six-year contract extension he signed in 2005, has been unhappy with his deal with the Giants. In 2009, he clashed with the coaches over playing time, even threatening to retire if he was not made a starter. âAny time you mention my name, it seems as if itâs just a firestorm of negativity, and Osi doing this and Osi doing that,â Umenyiora said. âNobody in that organization or on that team can tell you Iâm a disruption or a negative person or Iâm perceived in such a way, because theyâd be lying.â Last year, Umenyiora recorded 11Â½ sacks and set an N.F.L. record with 10 forced fumbles. But the Giants, rich with talent at defensive end, face some questions about the makeup of their defensive front, something that seemed to concern Umenyiora. The fixtures of the future defensive lines in New York are the captain Justin Tuck and the teamâs 2010 first-round draft pick, Jason Pierre-Paul. Less is known about the others. In addition to Umenyioraâs uncertain status, Mathias Kiwanuka, who missed most of last season with a herniated disk in his neck, will become a free agent. âIf they renegotiate my deal, I have to be on the field, and I have to perform,â said Umenyiora, who softened his stance on playing time last year. âTo play all those guys is going to be very, very difficult. For everyone to get their chance to showcase their skills, itâs going to be difficult to do that.â Umenyiora also responded to the criticism levied on Twitter by Philadelphia Eagles running back LeSean McCoy, who said Thursday that Umenyiora was the Giants’ third-best defensive lineman. Umenyiora referred to him as âLady Gaga,â a nickname the Giants have given to McCoy. âThat little Chihuahua or poodle in the backfield; he doesnât have to block me,â Umenyiora said. He added: âIf you have something to say, say it man to man; you canât be a Twitter gangster. Thatâs easy to do, trying to be a tough guy. Say it to my face, and weâll see what happens.â The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
