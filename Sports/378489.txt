If you have ever visited Baseball-Reference.com, you know that it is one of the greatest inventions of human history. Not only does the site contain every baseball statistic you could ever want, sorted in every imaginable way, but it also has cool circular icons that represent every team a player ever played for, and his uniform number on that team. So when you look up, say, Nick Swisher, you get four circles: green-and-gold No. 25 for the Athletics, green-and-gold No. 33 for the Athletics, black-and-silver pinstriped No. 30 for the White Sox, and Yankee pinstriped No. 33. Most Baseball-Reference.com users probably ignore the circles in their pursuit of the playerâs OPS from 2005. I see them as little stories, iconic representations of a playerâs career. In Swisherâs case, the circles remind us of his humble beginnings as a September call-up in 2004 who wore whatever uniform number was available. The kid who batted .250 in 60 at bats gets equal circle time with the current Yankees slugger. A player with only one circle is either a rookie or Derek Jeter. Jeterâs lone pinstriped No. 2 demonstrates his significance as clearly as any line of stats, photo montage, or 2,500-word essay on his brilliance. Seventeen seasons, one team, one number, unchanging and unchangeable, the Internet equivalent of a statue by the main gate. There arenât many one-circle guys in baseball history. Mike Schmidt has two circles because he wore No. 22 for 13 games before switching to the more familiar No. 20. (He also wore a Halloween wig on the field once, but he does not get a circle with a wig for that.) Robin Yount is a one-circle guy who has three circles to represent changes in the Brewers uniform over the years. The Tigers, who through most of their history kept their biggest stars forever and ever, have a lot of guys who came close to having one circle, but even Al Kaline changed uniform numbers once. Lou Whitaker was a one-circle guy, with uniform No. 1, making his circle doubly cool.  More interesting than the one-circle guys are the million-circle guys. The Brewersâ Mark Kotsay has 10 circles, reflecting a myriad of trades and a relative lack of attachment to any one set of digits. His teammate Jerry Hairston has 11 circles. LaTroy Hawkins has 11 circles, meaning that the Brewers have the market nearly cornered on high-circle guys. Multiple circles reflect a dichotomy. The player was good enough to play for many years, but not good enough to establish himself in any one place. Multiple-circle guys are invariable lefty outfielder-first basemen, or utility infielders, or middle relievers, guys who can trudge almost unnoticed through major league baseball for 15 years or so. A player with multiple circles is a survivor in a world of interchangeability: they can be replaced at any time, and often are, yet never quite go away. You might think of Craig Counsell as the circle champion, because he has been hanging around baseball for 16 years as an on-and-off starter and utility guy. But Counsell has only six circles by virtue of his ability to hang around for five years or so in every city. Counsell does have one of the most exhilaratingly lengthy fielding stat lines in the Baseball-Reference.com oeuvre. For most of his 15-year career, he has played three positions per year, though he sometimes mixed some first base and outfield into the results. Each position gets its own row of stats, so Counsellâs fielding record extends for an oppressive 44 lines. Like most baseball statistics, the needless detail is both impressive and oppressive; knowing that Counsell turned eight double plays at shortstop for the 2002 Diamondbacks is not important to anyone on earth, even Counsell, and you can feel guilty for being able to find that stat so easily when you do not know, say, your wifeâs shoe size. The long statistical trails can bury you in obscure data points. The circles tell a more succinct story, that of a utility infielder good enough to change teams only occasionally and preserve his signature No. 30 through most of the moves. Those Baseball-Reference.com circles can be like happy little glowing suns, greeting you with cheery colors, and sometimes a surprise, when you load up a page in search of quick information or deep meaning. Many of us searched for Dan Johnson just seconds after his game-tying home run against the Yankees on Wednesday. Johnson, who did not make the Rays postseason roster despite his playoff-clinching heroics (the Rays needed an extra catcher more than a âsluggerâ with a .119 batting average), is obscure as major leaguers go, yet he is the proud holder of five circles. Johnson was the Athleticsâ starting first baseman for a few years, which is easy to forget, but he has also picked up three circles for three uniform numbers in Tampa: He has accumulated almost as many circles as doubles (four). Itâs a visual cue of how tenaciously he has hung on, through long stints in the minors and hit-your-nieceâs-weight seasons, to become immortalized as an end-of-season hero and trivia question. Many of us grew up dreaming of playing in the major leagues. We would kill to have just one circle on Baseball-Reference.com. Had we made it, though, we would probably pick up five of them, because we would be Johnsons, not Jeters.
