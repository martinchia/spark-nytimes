ST. LOUIS â After making a record 28 pitching changes in the N.L.C.S., Tony La Russa pulled the right levers with his bullpen on Wednesday night, making five more changes. They all went his way, and so the Cardinals took the first game of the 107th World Series, 3-2, in front of 46,406 at Busch Stadium. Read David Waldstein’s full story here.  


Game OverCardinals win the first game of the World Series, 3-2!


That’s it! Jason Motte comes in to earn the save in the ninth, and the Cardinals take Game 1 from the Rangers, 3-2. 
There was some controversy when Beltre grounded out to third for the second out, because he hopped out of the box as if he’d fouled the ball off his foot. But the umpires maintained their original call, to the chagrin of Ron Washington, who came out to argue. 
The game ended when Nelson Cruz flied out to left, sending the Cardinals streaming onto the field.  




Bottom of the EighthScoreless eighth gives Rangers one last chance


Lance Berkman led off the inning with an infield single and made it all the way to third on a sacrifice bunt and a ground out to shortstop. 
But Nick Punto watched a curveball from Scott Feldman, thrown on a full count, fall in for a third strike to end the inning. That’s a gutsy pitch in a big spot. 
Now here come the Rangers, with one last chance to tie it up.

The Rangers are left with one more chance… Dotel and Rhodes, with combined 33 MLB seasons, are making their World Series debuts in the same inning. Pretty cool.Thu Oct 20 02:50:01  via webTyler KepnerTylerKepner  Things are getting tense here at Busch Stadium, as the Cardinals still hold a slim lead, 3-2.  Mike Gonzalez and Scott Feldman combined to pitch a scoreless seventh for the Rangers.  And to Eric, commenter #10: It only matters where the ball is — either in fair or foul territory — when it moves past first or third base. Berkman’s two-run single in the fourth clearly bounced first in foul territory, but then it spun back into fair territory before it reached the bag.     Some men just walked through the press box with big guns and “Police Secret Service” stamped on their backs. Snipers to protect the First Lady, I guess, though after the carnage in Zanesville, I’m wondering if they’re here to destroy squirrels.  Marc Rzepcynski — a left-handed reliever with a last name Tony La Russa actually cannot pronounce, no joke — came in with one out and two runners on base and struck out Craig Gentry and Esteban German, a pair of right-handed hitters, to end the inning. He walked off the mound pumping his fists.      David Freese pounded a one-out double to right field; Cardinals fans pounded their mittens together in celebration.  Freese went to third on a wild pitch, before Yadier Molinda struck out swinging. After Nick Punto walked, La Russa brought in Allen Craig to pinch-hit for Carpenter, and Washington countered by pulling Wilson for Alexi Ogando.   Craig lined a ball down the right-field line, where Cruz attempted to make a sliding catch, but could only trap it with his legs.   That made it 3-2, in favor of the Cardinals  Let the chess match begin! Here’s Carpenter’s line: 6 innings, 5 hits, 2 runs, 1 walk, 4 strikeouts. He threw 87 pitches, 45 of them for strikes.       And here’s Wilson’s:  4 2/3 innings, 4 hits, 3 runs, 6 walks (2 intentional), 4 strikeouts. He threw 94 pitches, 50 of them for strikes.  An 0-2 count on Michael Young with a runner on third and two outs brought the crowd of 46,406 people to its feet, towels twirling above their heads. Young made them hold their breath when he punched a ball down the first-base line. But Pujols ranged to his left, slid down on his left leg to corral the ball, and made a 360-degree turn to throw Young out at first.  He pumped his fist in celebration as he ran off the field. Tony La Russa has marveled to the reporters all October about how much Pujols brings to the team on top of his bat. That was a clear example. For some mid-game reading, @TylerKepner looks at a side of Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa that is often lost. //t.co/lfkHy7mCThu Oct 20 01:48:21  via webNick CorasanitiNYTnickc  The debate on when to walk Albert Pujols can go on forever. But Ron Washington got it right with his gamble in the fifth. With one out and a man on second, Washington had C.J. Wilson intentionally walk Pujols to bring Matt Holliday, the Cardinals’ cleanup hitter, to the plate.  On the very next pitch, Holliday grounded an inside cutter down the third-base line for an inning-ending 5-4-3 double play.  Napoli’s blast in the top of the inning sucked some of the air out of Busch Stadium, for sure. And that sequence of events has quieted things a bit more.   It’s 2-2! With one out and a man on first, Mike Napoli crushed a 0-1 sinker that didn’t sink an estimated 389 feet into the right field stands. To my amateur eyes, it seemed a bit longer than that.  The homer was all the more surprising for these fans because Carpenter had looked so masterful against the previous hitter. He threw five pitches to Nelson Cruz, each one seemingly lower than the last, before coming up in the zone with a fastball to get him swinging.    After three and a half smooth innings, one of our starters finally experienced some turbulence.   C.J. Wilson opened the inning by pegging Albert Pujols, a machine programmed to play baseball, with a slider he held onto for too long. The ball clanged off Pujols’ robot body, and he took first base. Matt Holliday lined a ball into the right field corner for a double and both he and Pujols scored when Lance Berkman bounced a ball past Michael Young for a single.        David Freese smacked a ball to deep center, bringing the home fans out of their seats, but the ball was caught at the warning track. It’s 2-0 Cardinals. If Carpenter keeps pitching the way he has the past couple of innings, the Cardinals may not even need any more.    @DavidWaldstein writes on a Tale of Two Relievers, Darren Oliver and Arthur Rhodes. //t.co/nxnoPxNRThu Oct 20 01:06:01  via webNick CorasanitiNYTnickc  Chris Carpenter is throwing darts now. How could we have doubted the man? Andrus opened the inning by glancing a foul ball straight back into Molina’s glove. The catcher bounced out of his crouch in clear pain. From the replays, it looked like the ball forced his thumb back awkwardly. But he walked it off, and then Carpenter got Andrus swinging. Josh Hamilton struck out on an inside sinker, and Michael Young bounced one to shortstop.  When he’s on, Carpenter has the ability to make good hitters look feeble.     We’ve got one third of the game under our belt, and it’s all zeros, still.  Nick Punto led off and lined a ball to center for the Cardinals’ first hit. But Carpenter failed to help his own cause, bouncing a bunt outside the third-base line for a third strike. Furcal went down swinging, and then Jon Jay grounded weakly to second to end the inning.  Wilson, who has struggled in the playoffs thus far, seems comfortable tonight. No Cardinal has hit the ball particularly hard, and all of his outs through three have come via ground ball or strikeout.   Neither pitcher has come out with his best stuff, but they’re moving rather efficiently through these early innings nevertheless. Carpenter has fallen behind on a number of batters, but none of them have been able to make him pay, and he cruises through a 1-2-3 third.    David Freese, the hometown boy, drew a walk from Wilson with two outs. But Molina grounded softly to short to end the inning.   Through the first two rounds of these playoffs, the windows in the press box at Busch Stadium were left wide open, even during the colder nights. But they are shut tight for this one, giving the box a sort of eerie quiet.   And finally, no squirrel sightings to report.  Carpenter, who unlike his counterpart Wilson is wearing long sleeves, is all over the zone. Out of 29 pitches thus far, he’s thrown just 14 strikes.  With one out, Adrian Beltre ripped a sinker from Carpenter down the left field line. David Freese got some leather on it, but it bounced into left field as Beltre cruised to second. Carpenter then walked Nelson Cruz, who moved to the sixth spot for this series.   But Mike Napoli grounded into a 6-4-3 double play to end the inning.  Carpenter, of course, was brilliant in Game 5 of the N.L.D.S., but he’s been somewhat shaky in his other two starts. How would you, readers, evaluate his October?  It’s cold here at Busch Stadium, and the wind is blowing. The temperature at the start of the game was 49 degrees, and you can assume it’ll drop from there.  The fans here seem well equipped, though, with bright red scarves and red hoodies pulled tightly over their heads. C.J. Wilson, who has experimented with cryotherapy, which uses cold temperatures to aid muscle recovery, is pitching in short sleeves. He walked Rafael Furcal to start the bottom of the first, but worked his way out of the inning with the help of a nifty 5-4-3 double play.      From way up in the press box, Rangers look like the Cubs with these blue softball tops. Big difference: Rangers are a good baseball team.Thu Oct 20 00:15:17  via webTyler KepnerTylerKepner
  One half-inning gone and plenty of action already.  First, Yadier Molina did what he does best, firing a bullet to second to catch Ian Kinsler stealing at second and set off the first round of “Yadi! Yadi!” chants from the home crowd. The next batter, Elvis Andrus, rolled one to Albert Pujols’ right. Pujols led Carpenter a little too far with his throw to first, forcing Carpenter to go sprawling headfirst to make the catch. His momentum carried him through the bag, and he made the out, managing not to get stepped on by Andrus on the bang-bang play.  Tony La Russa said before the game that the Cards’ defense was much improved from earlier this year, and we just saw a little bit of that. Cardinals take the field. It’s 49 degrees, windy and  World Series Game 1 — Instant Autumn.Thu Oct 20 00:04:58  via TweetDeckDavid WaldsteinDavidWaldstein  We are about to get underway for Game 1 here at Busch Stadium.
