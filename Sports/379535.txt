Chris Mullin made plenty of basketball news this year despite the N.B.A. lockout. He was elected to the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame and the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame, and honored by the Buoniconti Fund to Cure Paralysis for his charity work. A former St. Johnâs star from Brooklyn, Mullin played 16 seasons in the N.B.A., experiencing the 1998-99 lockout with the Indiana Pacers. Mullin, 48, retired as a player in 2001 and was the general manager of the Golden State Warriors from 2004 to 2009. He is now an N.B.A. analyst for ESPN.   What kind of play can fans expect when the N.B.A. games start?  Early on, things will be a little sloppy. Having everything condensed is not advantageous for high-quality play. But it seems many of the guys were playing in charity games and other games, so that will help. The veteran teams that have been together will get off to quicker starts. The young teams will have more pressure to jell and learn the systems.  What do you think about the agreement?  I have not seen the final document, but Iâd say the owners got a good deal. The players gave up quite a bit. But theyâre both going to do fine. Minus the exchange of money, I did not see any major issues that got changed.   How do you think the Knicks will do?  Theyâre coming along, but I still think they still have needs. Basketball is not a game where you just add numbers up and say we have these big-time scorers and we win games. Dallas proved that. Balance, depth and compliment of talent wins. With Carmelo and Amarâe, they have two great, Hall of Fame-type players. But they do need a playmaker and someone to balance them out. Theyâre two similar players. They both play with the ball and are two high-volume scorers.  Will the Nets be successful when they move to Brooklyn?  I love the fact that theyâre going to Brooklyn. I think itâs going to work. I really do. With the Nets going to Brooklyn, itâs the first time in my mind that they will be a legitimate threat to the Knicks.   Have you followed St. Johnâs and Coach Steve Lavin, who is recovering from prostate cancer?  Heâs done a wonderful job bringing back energy and restoring credibility and respectability to the program. Weâre praying for him that he gets healthy. Itâs exciting that the school is coming back. Great people have put their whole life into that university. Coach Carnesecca. Jack Kaiser. I spent some time there after the Hall of Fame induction. Itâs a place always near and dear to my heart.  What N.B.A. players were the toughest for you to score against?  Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. They were very athletic guys who could disrupt your game and play great defense.  How do you like being an analyst with ESPN?  I like it. A lot was thrown at me last year, my first year. I have a better feel for what I want to do now. It keeps me reading and thinking about the game and talking basketball with people. My style is giving the facts. Iâm not into the rah-rah and make a stink about everything. I have an opinion and a reason about whatâs going on. But Iâm not into doing shtick.  In your prime, could you succeed in today’s game?  Shooting and the 3-point shot is such a big part of the game, not only making shots but spreading out the game and spacing the floor.
If I was out there with all these great athletes, I think I could probably find a spot to camp out and make a few shots.  Are you interested in becoming a general manager again or becoming a head coach?  I would consider doing both. I love being part of a team. A lot of my success has always come being part of a great family, part of a great team and using my talent to influence the success of a unit. With the right people, I would do it for sure.  Did you have a chance to be the general manager of the Knicks?  Nah, nah. That was a lot of speculation. Obviously, I have a great relationship and great respect for Donnie Walsh. If Donnie was in Timbuktu and he came calling I would be honored to work for him.  You live in California. What do you miss most about New York?  The people and the food. When I come back, one of my first stop always is John’s Pizzeria on Bleeker Street. I love working out at New York Athletic Club and walking in Central Park. Working for ESPN I get to come back at times and I look forward to it.  What’s on your iPod?  Stevie Wonder. Bruce Springsteen. Bob Seger. Rolling Stones.
