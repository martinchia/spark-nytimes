Advertisement  The police in Cincinnati yesterday charged Cincinnati Reds outfielder DEION SANDERS with a felony arising from his confrontation with an off-duty police officer at Riverfront Stadium last month. In upgrading earlier misdemeanor charges against Sanders, WILLIAM GUSTAVSON of the prosecutor's office said the player was charged with failure to comply with an order or signal of a police officer. Sanders was also charged with two misdemeanors for leaving the scene of an accident in the Aug. 8 incident, the police said. The police said Sanders was arrested after he ignored a warning by Officer Herb Kohus and driving his motor scooter through a restricted gate after a Reds home game. The police said Kohus was dragged about 30 feet while trying to turn Sanders's motorcycle off. Kohus, who was treated for ligament damage and scrapes, remains in physical therapy and has not returned to work, Gustavson said. Kohus said that he did not recognize Sanders and that Sanders refused the officer's request to see his driver's license. Sanders has pleaded innocent in Hamilton County Municipal Court to the original misdemeanor charges of resisting arrest and failing to provide a driver's license.
