Advertisement  Partners in the Yankees' ownership will meet in Tampa, Fla., today, apparently to make yet another change in managing partners. Daniel McCarthy, the current-but-yet-to-be-approved managing partner, declined last night to discuss the reason for the meeting. Another partner said he understood McCarthy would withdraw from the position and be replaced by Barry Halper, from Livingston, N.J., a noted collector of baseball memorabilia. "I'm not discussing anything about the partners," McCarthy said by telephone from Tampa. "If there's any announcement to be made tomorrow, Jeff Idleson will make it." Then he hung up. Idleson, the Yankees' media relations director, said from Pompano Beach, Fla., that he did not know the reason for the meeting. Advertisement George Steinbrenner, who owns 55 percent of the club, nominated McCarthy to succeed Robert Nederlander. Nederlander took over in August 1990, when Steinbrenner was banished from running the club by Commissioner Fay Vincent as a result of Steinbrenner's dealings with Howard Spira. Managing partners must be approved by the commissioner, the ownership committee and the other club owners. McCarthy met with Vincent on Jan. 15, but the commissioner was not satisfied with their session. They were scheduled to meet again this Friday. Advertisement Steinbrenner, who is trying to return to the post himself, was expected to nominate Halper because he would likely gain approval.
