Advertisement  Two British weight lifters, ANDREW DAVIES and ANDREW SAXTON, sent home from the Barcelona Olympics for failing drug tests, were cleared to resume competition yesterday. They had tested positive for the stimulant Clenbuterol in a pre-Games drug test. They were sent home in disgrace from Barcelona when the result was made public. But after a four-hour meeting Saturday, British weight-lifting's governing body ruled that the two men did not know that Clenbuterol was banned when they took the drug. Clenbuterol is used to treat asthma.  Davies and Saxton admitted taking Clenbuterol before the Games, but said they did not know it was banned. Saxton said he took it to relieve asthma, while Davies said he took it to relieve a tight chest. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
