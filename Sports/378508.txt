DETROIT â After the success he had two years ago leading the Yankees to the World Series title, Alex Rodriguez may have thought he had heard his final boos at Yankee Stadium. The fans in the Bronx on Sunday, however, produced more lusty hoots to again remind Rodriguez of his recent failures. After the first two games in the Yankeesâ American League division series, he was 0 for 8. But as unforgiving as the treatment may have been for Rodriguez, who had only 68 at-bats in the final two months of the season, it was nothing compared with the humiliation he went through here five years ago. As Rodriguez searches for his swing in the glare of the postseason, he arrived Monday at the place where he experienced perhaps the lowest moment of his career, also in the first round of the playoffs against the Detroit Tigers. On Oct. 7, 2006, Manager Joe Torre dropped Rodriguez to the No. 8 spot in the batting order for Game 4, ahead of only Melky Cabrera. Rodriguez had just gone 0 for 3 in Game 3 and was 1 for 11 in the series. Despite being devastated by the public indignity, he could only publicly accept his fate. âI got no one to blame but myself,â he said then. âYou got to look in the mirror and address that.â But things only became worse. Rodriguez went 0 for 3 in Game 4 as the Yankees were embarrassed by the Tigers in the final game of the series. He also committed a throwing error that led to an unearned run in the 8-3 loss, then had to account for his failure. After the game, Rodriguez, who had an opt-out in his contract after the 2007 season, was left to answer questions about whether he even wanted to be in New York anymore, or whether the Yankees wanted him to come back. âI mean, if theyâre dying to get me out of here, I hope not,â Rodriguez said after the game. âIâm 100 percent committed to being a Yankee. This is the only place I want to play.â A year later, in rather clumsy fashion, Rodriguez did opt out, and the news broke during Game 4 of the World Series as the Red Sox were on the verge of winning their second title in four years. But as he said, Rodriguez did come back, signing a staggering 10-year, $275 million contract with the Yankees two months later. Rodriguez continued to be under intense scrutiny in New York, but in 2009, he gave a command performance in the postseason, hitting .365 with 5 doubles, 6 home runs and 18 runs batted in as the Yankees won it all. After that, there could have been a reasonable expectation that the booing would cease for good. Two games and eight at-bats into the 2011 postseason, it returned with vigor. âIâm not surprised,â Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said, âbecause I think our fans want us to win so bad, and I think they always expect big things from Alex with his name and the things that heâs accomplished. Thereâs high expectations.â But no one else on the team, including Derek Jeter, who went 0 for 5 with two key strikeouts and made a throwing error, or Mark Teixeira, who went 0 for 4, were booed Sunday. They did not hear so much as a hiss. But when Rodriguez popped up in the eighth, the booing was loud and sustained. âThatâs the nature of being Alex, sometimes,â Girardi said. So far, Girardi, who attributed the Yankeesâ failures in Game 2 to Tigers starter Max Scherzer, has shown no inclination to take the drastic measure that Torre did five years ago. Rodriguez was batting fourth again for Game 3 on Monday, just as he had in the first two games. In the last few days of the regular season, Girardi moved Robinson Cano into the third spot in the batting order from the fifth spot. The plan was devised to ensure that, with Rodriguez batting behind him, Cano would see enough good pitches to hit. And despite Rodriguezâs struggles and Canoâs success in Game 1 (he had a grand slam and six R.B.I.), the Tigers have pitched to him. During the Yankeesâ ninth-inning rally in Game 2, Cano came to the plate with runners on first and second and two outs. Tigers Manager Jim Leyland said he considered walking Cano to load the bases and pitching to Rodriguez, which would have been another small slap to Rodriguez. But Leyland did not do it, instead pitching to Cano, who grounded out for the final out. âAlexâs presence, I think, is what changed him,â Girardi said. After Game 2, Rodriguez said he was looking forward to the opportunity to change everyoneâs opinion with one big hit. He said he would not react emotionally to the booing, and invoked a Zen approach to his future at-bats. Occasionally, players who are booed at home look forward to going on the road, where they can blend in. For Rodriguez, coming to Detroit, the site of one of his worst moments in the game, might not have provided one of those times.
