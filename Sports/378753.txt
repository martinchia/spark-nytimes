SAN ANTONIO â U.C.L.A.captured the N.C.A.A. womenâs volleyball tournament championship Saturday night, beating Illinois in four sets for the fourth national title in program history and the Bruins’ first since 1991. âI feel numb,â said U.C.L.A.Coach Michael Sealy, who is the first coach to play for a menâs volleyball championship team (U.C.L.A. in 1993) and coach a womenâs team to a title. After rallying to take the first set, the Bruins seemed in control with a 20-13 lead in the second. But the Illini went on a 12-3 run, capped by 2 points by the 6-foot-6 freshman Liz McMahon to even the match. That Illini rally actually helped put the Bruins in a good mind-set to win the match.  âWe went in the locker room after the second set, we just kind of all looked at each other and we were like we’re just going to have fun,â said the U.C.L.A. junior outside hitter Rachael Kidder. âEveryone’s going to lose sets and win sets, and you can’t get caught up in it. And we were just confident that it was our game the whole time, and we knew if we had the momentum and we were in control of the game then it was going to go our way.” Illinois’s Colleen Ward, a first-team all-American, however, put down the first kill, one of her 17 on the night, and the Illini took a 12-8 lead. But the Bruins rallied again and rattled off the last 4 points of the set to go up 2-1. âAfter we went into the locker room after Set 2, I think that was a really big turning point for us,â said the junior outside hitter Tabi Love. âYeah, we were down in the third set, but we had already made the decision that we were going to win it. And so it was easy to come back.â Losing the third-set lead was a tough blow to the Illini. âIt could have went either way,â Ward said. âThey got the points. It was definitely hard for us to come back in the fourth.â That comeback was going to be even more difficult against the U.C.L.A. defense, which carried the Bruins, who hit .189 through the first three sets. The Bruins were able to collect 15 blocks, led by the freshman middle blocker Zoe Nightingale, who had 11 in the match. âSometimes technically she’s not the most sound blocker,” Sealy said of Nightingale. “But there’s just an aggressive instinct she has. She has the ability to really reach into low seams and get over the net.â The Bruins controlled the fourth set, taking a 14-7 lead and never looking back. The senior middle blocker Sara Sage entered the match in the fourth set and provided six kills en route to the 108th national championship over all in school history, an N.C.A.A. record. âIt means a lot,â Kidder said. âI think it feels really good for our team and even better for the school.â
