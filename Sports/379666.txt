Advertisement  AP Cincinnati Reds reliever Rob Dibble was suspended for four games and fined an undisclosed amount by National League President Bill White today for throwing a baseball into the stands and hurting a spectator. But Dibble delayed the penalties by appealing. He now faces a total of seven games out of uniform for two angry outbursts this season. Last month, White suspended Dibble for three games and fined him $1,000 for throwing a pitch behind the back of Houston's Eric Yelding, touching off a brawl. Dibble appealed that first suspension and is continuing to pitch pending a June 17 hearing in New York. There was no hearing date set for an appeal of today's suspension, his fourth from the league in the last three seasons. White today suspended and fined Dibble for hurling a baseball into the center-field stands last Sunday after a 4-3 victory over the Chicago Cubs. Unhappy that he gave up two runs before getting the last out, Dibble turned and heaved the ball, which struck Meg Porter, a first-grade teacher, on the elbow. The 27-year-old Porter required medical treatment and missed several days of work. Dibble visited her home Wednesday and apologized. He also agreed to pay her expenses from the injury. Dibble's throw violated a strict league policy against players' tossing baseballs into the stands. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
