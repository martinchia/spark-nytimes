Advertisement By WILLIAM N. WALLACE Never before have there been so many contenders -- at least a dozen -- for college football's national championship, a crown always more ethereal than substantial, as the regular season comes to an end. The second season, the bowl games, may settle the dust a little. For example the Orange Bowl contest, between Colorado and Notre Dame, will match the two contenders who played the most difficult schedules. Schedule strength is one rational line of thinking for an irrational project, determining a champion without a playoff system. The dozen contenders are as follows, alphabetically: Brigham Young (10-1): Lost to Oregon. Opponents' winning percentage: .508. Plays at Hawaii ( 6-5), on Saturday. Then it will play in the Holiday Bowl against Texas A&M (8-2-1) on Dec. 29. Advertisement Clemson (9-2): Lost to Virginia and Georgia Tech. Opponents percentage: .547. Plays Illinois (8-3) in Hall of Fame Bowl on Jan. 1. Advertisement Colorado (10-1-1): Lost to Illinois, tied Tennessee. Opponents' percentage, .595. Plays Notre Dame (9-2) in Orange Bowl on Jan. 1. Florida (9-1): Lost to Tennessee. Opponents' percentage: .519. Plays at Florida State, 8-2, on Saturday. Ineligible for bowl game. Florida State (8-2): Lost to Miami and Auburn. Opponents' percentage: .514. Plays Florida (9-1) on Saturday, then Penn State (9-2) in Blockbuster Bowl on Dec. 28. Georgia Tech (9-0-1): Tied North Carolina. Opponents' percentage: .537. Plays at Georgia (4-6) on Saturday, then in the Citrus Bowl against Nebraska (9-2) on Jan. 1. Miami (8-2): Lost to Brigham Young and Notre Dame. Opponents' percentage: .580.

Faces Iowa (8-3) in Rose Bowl on Jan. 1. The official football guide of the National Collegiate Athletic Association lists four determining sources of a national champion and each is a poll. There is The Associated Press, which polls a select list of sports- writers and broadcasters; United Press International, which polls a group of coaches; the Football Writers Association of America, which polls a panel of its members, and the National Football Foundation, which has its own panel that always agrees with the A.P. poll. Only once in the last 15 seasons, 1978, has there been a disagreement among these four ranking systems. That year, U.P.I. held out for Southern California while the other three selected Alabama. Before Notre Dame defeated Southern California, 10-6, on Saturday the coach of the Irish, Lou Holtz, said his team no longer had any national championship aspirations and that honor would go elsewhere. But Holtz has been known to change his mind. Since verbosity is almost as important as victory in the polling business, the football world should be hearing more from the Notre Dame mentor before the Colorado game and perhaps after. Because the deals had all been made, there were no surprises when the bowl invitations were officially tendered after Saturday's games. Advertisement "That makes a mockery of the process," said John Swofford, the North Carolina athletic director and chairman of the N.C.A.A.'s post-season-events committee. The system will be abandoned next year. There were a few surprises on the field. Iowa was upset by Minnesota but will to the Rose Bowl nevertheless to play Washington. Virginia lost to Virginia Tech, the Cavaliers' third defeat in the last four games, but will go to the Sugar Bowl to meet Tennessee. Syracuse was crushed by Miami, 33-7, but will show up for the Aloha Bowl in Honolulu to meet Arizona, which edged Arizona State, 21-17. Raghib Ismail of Notre Dame helped his Heisman Trophy candidacy by gaining 180 all-purpose yards against U.S.C. and before a national television audience. So did Ty Detmer, the Brigham Young quarterback, in passing for 560 yards in a 45-10 victory over Utah State. Detmer, who has another regular-season game left, thus broke the year-old N.C.A.A. record of Houston's Andre Ware for most yards passing in a season, 4,869 to 4,699. Detmer had five touchdown passes and also five intercepted passes.
