 To the Sports Editor: Re “Points for Product Placement,” April 6: That college athletes do not share in the largess of big-time college athletics is a myth. Most athletes in N.C.A.A. Division I receive scholarships, often in the range of $25,000 to $50,000 or more a year, and they do not pay for flights around the country, hotel rooms, training tables, trainers, athletic shoes and clothes, first-rate practice facilities not available to other students, tutoring and more. These benefits add up to far more than professional athletes make in the N.B.A. Development League, minor league baseball, arena football and the Canadian Football League. The money to pay for all of these perks must come from somewhere, and if it is not from athletic department revenue, then it comes at the expense of families like mine who pay full tuition to have children attend major universities as nonathletes. Let’s stop the poorly thought-out call for payments to college athletes. JEFFREY WEINSTEIN Dayton, Ohio Advertisement  To the Sports Editor: If the N.C.A.A. won’t guarantee student-athletes medical care for injuries sustained on a team and won’t allow them to share in the profits of selling their names and images, let’s start by removing all advertising logos from uniforms and shoes. Advertisement I suspect athletes would be disciplined for putting a bit of tape over them. JIM HABER Wayland, Mass. A Players Union Paradox To the Sports Editor: Re “Voices Emerging Against a Union,” April 6: Central to the underlying decision that Northwestern’s football players are employees under the National Labor Relations Act is their expansive subjugation to coach-dictated control. However, a corollary of that circumstance — the player-to-coach obedience embedded in the culture of team sports — very likely ensures that a majority of the player-employees, at Coach Pat Fitzgerald’s urging, will vote no in the pending union election.

Boxers have known that for a century, but the promise of a wealthier life for the few who excelled in their sport continued to draw those with no better alternatives until today’s even more brutal versions became popular. Lots of sports are dangerous, but so is being with the police or fire departments. As long as the athletes know of the dangers, why not let them make the decision whether it is all worthwhile? ARTHUR O. ARMSTRONG Manhattan Beach, Calif. To the Sports Editor: The current Czech and Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech has worn a rugby-style scrum cap while playing soccer after a head injury several years ago. There are ways to protect players with minimal compromise when coaches, administrators and equipment makers are committed to player safety and long-term health, and when athletes are creative and open to change. MIKE MCKENNA Weybridge, Vt. A Better Way to ‘Catch’ Trout To the Sports Editor: Re “In Montana, Cutthroat Trout Are Hungry Trout,” April 9: Because the cutthroat trout is one of God’s most perfect and beautiful creatures, and because it is guileless, the only way it should be fished is with a dry fly with the hook cut off at the shank. The cutthroat pulling the fly underwater is counted as a catch, thus avoiding the obscenity of a day of 138 fish caught and released with its attendant small but significant mortality. DAVID GREGORY Santa Fe, N.M. A version of this letter appears in print on April 13, 2014, on Page SP8 of the New York edition with the headline: Defining a ‘Fair Share’ for College Athletes.
