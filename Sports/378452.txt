Advertisement  Major league clubs changed the rules of the amateur draft to enhance their bargaining leverage and reduce their costs, baseball's arbitrator found yesterday. Five weeks after striking down the new draft rules that extended a club's rights to a player from one year to as many as five years, George Nicolau issued an 18-page opinion explaining his decision. He ruled on July 17 that changes in the draft rules had to be negotiated with the union because the draft is linked to the provision in the collective bargaining agreement covering compensation for free agents. "The obvious effect of the changes was to dramatically shift leverage in the clubs' favor and, as is quite apparent from the evidence, this is what the clubs wanted to do," Nicolau wrote. Nicolau will hold hearings to determine what remedies, if any, he should grant the Players Association and the players who were drafted in June.
