Freddy Garcia, a pitcher the Yankees signed in February not knowing if heâd make the team, and Bartolo Colon, who had been absent from the major leagues since JulyÂ  2009, have certainly been nice stories for the Yankees so far, but their starts to the season go well beyond the realm of pleasant surprises. In the shadows of the highly anticipated Cliff Lee-Josh Beckett showdown in Philadelphia on Tuesday night, Garcia continued to flourish, pitching six innings and allowing two earned runs as the Yankees routed the Milwaukee Brewers, 11-2.  Through his first 14 starts this season, Garcia is nearly matching the best start heâs ever had to a season, going 7-6 with a 3.21 earned run average, with 55 strikeouts in 84 innings (5.89 K/9 IP). In 2002 with the Seattle Mariners, Garcia was 8-4 with a 3.20 E.R.A. with a K/9 IP rate of 7.37. Colon, who has been out since June 11 with a hamstring injury, is having a similarly impressive and unlikely start to the 2011 season. His first 10 starts have yielded a 5-2 record with a 2.96 E.R.A., and heâs striking out nearly eight batters per nine innings.  Itâs easily his best start to a season since 2005, when he started 5-3 with a 2.53 E.R.A. The throw-until-it-sticks strategy the Yankees employed this spring with their rotation, which included the other, less successful reclamation projects Carlos Silva (currently on the disabled list in Class AAA Scranton-Wilkes-Barre) and Kevin Millwood (now with Bostonâs Class AAAÂ  affiliate Pawtucket), has undoubtedly worked so far.  But Colon, who hasn’t started more than 20 games in a season since 2005, has already found his way to the disabled list (possibly returning this weekend) and Garcia hasn’t finished a season with an E.R.A. under 4.00 since 2005 (3.87). The rest of the rotation, outside of C.C. Sabathia, has its own questions. Ivan Nova is dealing with the typical ups and downs of a rookie season, and A.J. Burnett, while steadier than last season, is still working on his Jekyll and Hyde routine. The biggest question of all remains Phil Hughes, though early signs are encouraging. Hughes threw 88 pitches in six and a third effective innings for Class AA Trenton on Wednesday. Most encouraging of all, his fastball was regularly clocked at 93 miles per hour, topping out at 94 m.p.h. Some were viewing this weekâs Phillies-Red Sox series as a preview of whatâs to come in this seasonâs World Series. With marquee pitching matchups like Cliff Lee-Josh Beckett and Cole Hamels-Jon Lester, it certainly has an October feel to it. The Yankees, the Red Sox and the Phillies are all where most expected them to be heading into July. The three teams with the largest payrolls in baseball have the three best records in the league. But while Boston, despite its own starting pitching vulnerabilities, and Philadelphia are where they are in part because of their aces, the Yankees have relied on the unlikely comeback stories of two aging, veteran pitchers. How worried should Yankees fans be about matching up in October?
