Canada (3-0-2), playing in Quebec, finished with 8 points. The United States was a 4-3 winner over Finland, which also advanced. The Americans finished 4-1-0 for 8 points, but Canada finished first because it had earlier defeated the United States.

The United States, with what appears to be its best team since the Mary Lou Retton-led Olympic squad of 1984, was second going into today's optionals with 196.208. Romania was third with 195.795. China was fourth with 195.270. Competition in the men's optionals began later yesterday. The Soviet Union held a comfortable lead after compulsories.

(AP) HORSE RACING World Record on Grass Known Ranger, a 5-year-old gelding from England, matched the world record for running a mile on the grass yesterday at Belmont Park when the horse won the Snow Knight Handicap in 1:322/5 and came within one-fifth of a second of matching Dr. Fager's world record set on the dirt 23 years ago. The gelding, owned by Claiborne Farm and trained by Bill Badgett Jr., was ridden by Julie Krone over the Widener turf course, which was officially labeled "fast." Known Ranger won by two lengths over the favorite Fourstardave, who had four lengths on Sifting Gold. The winner, who paid $6.40 for $2 to win, carried 113 pounds, 11 fewer than Fourstardave but 1 more than Expensive Decision carried on Oct. 8 when he set the world record for a mile on the grass at Belmont.
