DETROIT â It was a happily eerie scene at Comerica Park on Thursday, as the new Detroit Tigers slugger Prince Fielder sat on the dais for a news conference, flanked by his cute, curly-haired 7-year-old son, Jadyn. Father and son both wore No. 28 Tigers home white jerseys, with the name Fielder on the back. Dad was holding court, as son curiously watched the throng of reporters in front of him asking questions. It was the same as 22 years ago, when Prince Fielder’s father, Cecil Fielder, was introduced as a Tiger and brought his cute baseball-playing son to the spotlight. Prince Fielderâs world came full-circle on Thursday, as he officially became part of his favorite childhood team with a nine-year, $214 million contract. âItâs really awesome, donât know what to say, I never thought it could happen and now itâs happened,â Prince Fielder, 27, said. âThis is an awesome moment. A special day.â The addition of Prince Fielder augments and changes the look of the American League Central-champion Tigers. Slugger Miguel Cabrera will move to third base, Prince Fielder will play first, and Manager Jim Leyland said the D.H. slot would remain flexible during the season.

Leyland was asked if he was concerned about the Tigersâ defense and speed, given that Prince Fielder and Cabrera are both on the bigger side and not known for their swiftness on the basepaths. âIf they hit where theyâre supposed to hit them, they can trot,â Leyland said, dryly. âIâd rather have a slow guy that can hit, than a fast guy who canât.â Prince Fielder laughed and said he was looking forward to playing with the Tigers. âThe fans are really excited, and itâs nice they remember me,â Prince Fielder said. To play in front of the fans who watched me grow up, itâs cool.â  The Tigers, Detroit and Prince Fielder have a special connection. Cecil Fielder was a superstar for the team from 1990 to 1996, before being traded to the Yankees. He was  known for his big homers and oversized frame and personality to match. He also had a pint-sized doppelganger in Prince. The two were  virtually inseparable in and out of the ballpark. Prince Fielder played in the Tigers clubhouse, with players loving to goof around with him and sneak him candy when his dad was not looking. Prince Fielder said one of his favorite memories was, âbeing thrown into clubhouse trash cans by  Tony Phillips and Pete Incavigiliaâ. The father and son  filmed a McDonaldâs commercial in 1992 that had Prince striking out his dad in a backyard game. The Tigers wanted to draft Prince Fielder in 2002, but he went to the Milwaukee Brewers with the seventh pick. The Tigers had the eighth pick, and took shortstop Scott Moore, who ultimately had little impact and was traded  in 2005. Ilitch said he now relished  bringing Prince Fielder âback home.â âAt the old ballpark, Cecil would come up to the box after Tigers games and bring me food,â Ilitch said. âHeâd sit down, and all he did was talk about Prince.  âAnd Prince is going to do this and that.â I said to myself, âTypical father, bragging about one of his kids.â But I know Cecil well, and how often Prince was in the ballpark, getting very familiar with it at a young age.â Ilitch turned to Prince Fielder and said, âWhat were you, 14, when you hit it into the upper deck?â Ilitchâs math was a little off, and Prince Fielder politely corrected the record. âNo, 12,â he said, as he looked down at his baseball-playing son standing next to him in a Tigers  jersey.
