The N.C.A.A. tournament can be daunting: so many games, so many networks, so little time. Luckily, technology can tell us what to get excited about, and when.  Thuuz, a web-based service described in a Times review by Joshua Brustein on March 13, sounds like a dream-come-true for the busy fan (or freelancer). Thuuz uses computer algorithms to analyze play-by-play statistics, rates the quality of games on a 100-point scale, then sends e-mail or text messages to users when, in Brusteinâs words, âtheir personal threshold for excitement is reached.â  Eager to explore my personal threshold of excitement to its fullest, I signed up for Thuuz just before the start of the tournament. Excitement is Relative
Subscribers to Thuuzâs free service get to select their favorite teams and sports. Itâs a top-down design, so you can tunnel quickly through âAll Basketballâ to âNCAA Menâsâ to âMarch Madnessâ and/or your favorite teams, from the Kansas Jayhawks to the Campbell Fighting Camels. Hockey, baseball, football, soccer, and cricket are all represented, so you can keep track of next weekâs I.C.C. World Cup Semifinals with the help of Thuuz if you so desire.

Your sport and team preferences determine whether Thuuz sends you an alert, and it also has an impact on the âexcitementâ calculations. Choose a favorite team, and a little thumbs-up reading â+10â appears next to all of that teamâs upcoming games. Games of national importance also get excitement modifiers. There are no âminusâ penalties at this time, though that may change after a few more Nets-Cavaliers games. Thuuzâs calculations produce some strange results. North Carolinaâs three-point win over Washington on Sunday earned an excitement score of â99,â a worthy total for a thrilling game. On the other hand, a Virginia Tech-Wichita State N.I.T. game earned a â92.â The Super Bowl scored only â83,â one point less than Kent Stateâs four-point N.I.T. win over Fairfield. You would expect some default hierarchy to rank Super Bowls and Final Four games above regular season N.B.A. games and cricket matches, and to rank those games above lawn dart competitions and the N.I.T., unless the user is a Kent State alum who custom-adjusts the settings. As it now stands, Packers fans must use the âthumbs upâ to raise their team above the Golden Flash. Mild Thrills You May Have Missed
Thuuz e-mail alerts classify games as either âgoodâ or âgreat.â (You can also receive alerts for âOKâ or even âdullâ games if your personal excitement threshold is very low). The e-mail header âGood Gameâ damns with faint praise, promising the most meager of thrills. Do you switch away from a game that just started, which still has the potential to be âgreat,â to watch the end of something merely âgood?â You probably donât crawl out of bed for such a game: Thuuz sent a “Good Game” email at 12:20 a.m. Eastern on Saturday about Georgia vs. Washington. A good game is simply good; a good nightâs sleep is outstanding. Missing a âGreat Game,â however, can cause anxiety. Discover on Saturday evening that Temple has taken San Diego State to double overtime, and you might rip the Wii remotes from your childrenâs hands and commandeer the television. Unfortunately, you may tune in just in time to see the Kawhi Leonard dunk that opens up a seven-point San Diego State lead in the waning seconds. The Thuuz designers are still working on the predictive element of their programs. âGreat Gameâ alerts arrive like belated invitations to a party. Thuuz caused several temporal dilemmas throughout the first weekend of the tournament. The alerts provide helpful hints for fans with TiVO and/or a Tardis: âWatch from 17:29 to go in the 2nd half,â reads the typical e-mail that arrives with 1:18 to play. DVRs and Internet streams make such rewinds possible, but do you really want to do it? Faced with the news that Michigan is taking Duke to the wall, do you rush to the local tavern to watch the final two minutes with a crowd, or do you retreat to your laptop and start watching with 10:43 to go in the first half? One option provides the visceral thrill of fandom, the other context and a deep understanding of how the game unfolded.  Of course, if you are enough of a college basketball fan to subscribe to a service like Thuuz, you are probably not going to lose track of a Duke-Michigan game in the first place. I was watching Marquette-Syracuse on Sunday night when Thuuz told me Texas-Arizona was a “Great Game.” âThe top of the screen could have told you that,â my wife said as I switched networks. âItâs tied with a minute left!â Twitter also beats Thuuz to the punch: everyone Tweets about tournament games, from sportswriters to friends to N.F.L. players with little else to do right now. The Thuuz alert often arrives after 10 minutes of Tweets along the lines of âButler could upset Pitt!â meaning it might as well not arrive at all. Across the Spectrum
Thuuzâs most fascinating feature is the color-coded timeline it uses to illustrate each gameâs excitement level. The graph displays intense moments in fiery red, routine stretches in dull yellow, and so on. Dukeâs narrow win over Michigan starts with a band of yellow, then turns deep orange before finishing in a blaze of red. By contrast, Dukeâs blowout against Hampton (a 3 on the Thuuz excitement meter), graphs as two long rectangles: the first half drab yellow, the second the sickly color of dried paste. Itâs basketball as Piet Mondrain imagined it. These timelines can be used to rate and classify any aspect of life. Take marriages: the honeymoon is a brief flash of burgundy, followed by the rich orange of carefree youth, the cool yellow of parenthood, the cold white of family problems, and finally -â hopefully -â a return to tangerine-hued everyday bliss. In our autumn years, we may embrace the spirit of Thuuz by turning to our spouses, reflecting on our lives (starting a decade ago, when things really got exciting) and alerting them that the experience was, overall, a “Good Game.”
