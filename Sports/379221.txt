Advertisement By WILLIAM N. WALLACE The 1992 Winter Olympics may have ended yesterday, but we have not heard the last of speed skater BONNIE BLAIR and figure skater KRISTI YAMAGUCHI who, among other things, will advise us to drink water in future months. Evian, one of more than 40 firms that are official Olympic sponsors, signed Blair and Yamaguchi in advance on the good chance they would be gold-medal winners at Albertville. It came to pass for both, and now these two athletes will tour the United States extolling the merits of Evian water in maintaining a healthy life style. As for the Summer Games in Barcelona, Spain, Evian has signed swimmer MATT BIONDI, volleyball player STEVE TIMMONS, diver WENDY WILLIAMS and cyclist CONNIE YOUNG. These six athletes make up the Evian Peak Performance Team and the corporate reasoning is that the better their Olympic performances, the more convincing their subsequent endorsements. Blair and Yamaguchi are also to appear on trading cards that the United States Olympic Committee has licensed Impel Marketing to produce. Impel's first two series, of former decathlon athletes and other star Olympians of the past, came out last year. This year will bring a collectible series of Olympic hopefuls, like Williams, who introduced the cards recently, and next fall sets of 1992 Olympic medalists like Blair and Yamaguchi.
