INDIANAPOLIS — AsÂ at any major event, security is a top concern at this yearâs Super Bowl. It is an issue that should be taken seriously by everyone. But that doesnât mean there is no opportunity for humor. For instance, the list of banned items at this yearâs game includes the standard items like weapons, fireworks and mace. But it also has the following: Fans can bring cameras, but cannot bring cases for them. They can bring binoculars, but those similarly will have to be unprotected. No camcorders will be allowed, but since virtually every camera and phone manufactured at this point can shoot video, itâs unclear how they intend to prevent people making videos. It is not just security at the game that the N.F.L. is concerned with, as the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Thursday that a raid of fake merchandise had seized more than $4.8 million in fake N.F.L. merchandise and shut down 307 Web sites over the last few months. Proving that in sports people count everything, the total haul of counterfeit goods was 42,692 items of fake Super Bowl memorabilia and an additional 22,570 items representing other sports leagues. The raid was called Operation Fake Sweep by I.C.E., and you have to assume that whatever government official came up with that name was quite proud. Finally, on Sunday the airspace above Lucas Oil Stadium will be restricted during the game, so it is unclear if there will be any F-18’s doing a flyover. The concept may seem ridiculous, as the stadium has a roof, but that did not stop them from doing one over Cowboys Stadium last season. The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
