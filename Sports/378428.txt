Advertisement  Croquet, once exclusively a sport of the privileged, still requires all-white outfits. But it has begun to attract an occasional blue-collar player. A United States Croquet Association survey of the association's 5,000 members shows that one in four is a millionaire, and one in four drives a Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Cadillac or BMW. But 5 percent drive Volkswagens. And last year's top-ranked player was a machinist. ''It's just in the last couple of years that croquet has been available to people who don't belong to country clubs or have private courts,'' said Peyton Ballenger, a top American player. Ballenger, one of croquet's few club pros in the United States, works at the PGA Sheraton Resort, headquarters of the croquet association.

Fifty students at all levels of ability will be taught by some of the world's best players.

Association membership has increased from 5 clubs in 1977 to more than 300 this year. Clubs can be found in such middle-class places as Arkadelphia, Ark.; Rockford, Ill.; Lewisburg, W. Va., and Keokuk, Iowa. The backyard game is only a distant relative of the croquet played here, where the wickets are narrower, the mallets are heavier, the rulebook thicker and tempers shorter. ''You'll occasionally see a mallet fly through the air,'' Ballenger said.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
