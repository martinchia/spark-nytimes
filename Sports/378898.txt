With all the late-season record chasing by Drew Brees, Darren Sproles, Jimmy Graham and the Saints’ offense as a whole, wide receiver Marques Colston remained under the radar, as usual. But when Colston, the quiet Hofstra alumnus, passed 1,000 yards receiving for the season Sunday against Carolina, it was the fifth time in his six years that he had accomplished the feat. Of all the receivers in N.F.L. history, only Randy Moss did it in each of his first six campaigns. (He did not do it in his seventh.) Even the great Jerry Rice missed in his rookie season before reeling off 11 straight. Colston has never been selected to the Pro Bowl. Extra point Colston passed another Hofstra receiver, the Jets’ Wayne Chrebet, in career N.F.L. touchdown receptions this season, with 48 (Chrebet had 41 but still has more receptions and receiving yards). If you’re wondering how Chrebet is faring after his career was ended by concussions, see this article from November, which concludes: âI always said that they were going to have to carry me off this field to get me to retire. Unfortunately, they did. Canât complain; it was a great ride.â The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
