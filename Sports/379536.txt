When Gregg Berhalter was hired last week to take the job as head coach of Swedish club Hammarby, it was a remarkable breakthrough for American soccer.  Over most of the past decade, the United States has gradually been able to increase its rate of exporting professional players to Europe. This trend, however, has not been true for American coaches who have found little, if any, success in Europe.  As both a player and an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Galaxy, Berhalter announced in the middle of the M.L.S. season that this would be his last as a player. It was also about the time when he was approached by former teammate and the current Galaxy academy director Chris Klein about a vacancy at the Stockholm-based Hammarby.  The two clubs are closely related. Anschutz Entertainment Group owns the Galaxy as well as 49 percent of Hammarby. Klein is also on the board at Hammarby and was able to put Berhalter’s name in play.  Berhalter, who was born in Englewood, N.J., and grew up in Tenafly, N.J., eventually was hired in mid-December. Berhalter was given a two-year contract, with Hammarby holding an option for an additional year.  âI was excited,â Berhalter said. âAs a candidate for the job, I knew I was in contention. I think itâs a good step for me and I think itâs the right move at the right time. I was definitely sad to leave the Galaxy and my coaching position there but Iâm excited.â  As a player, Berhalter was a journeyman having played for seven different professional clubs during his career. His first clubs were based in the Netherlands. He then played one season in England at Crystal Palace before moving to Germany. His final club was the Galaxy, which he joined in 2009.  While he changed clubs frequently, he was consistently a key part of the each of the teams he played for. It was in Germany, however, where he began to view the game with the eye of a coach.  âItâs funny, youâre a certain type of player but youâre still young,â Berhalter said. âAs I got a little bit older, I started thinking about the game in a coaching way. You start having discussions with people and you start to really get into it. It becomes exciting. As I was getting older, I felt like I was going to move into that role.â Berhalter began to acquire his coaching licenses in Germany and continued it in the United States. He still needs to obtain the final licenses but will be pursuing them vigorously in Sweden.  The challenges that await Berhalter are immense. The club was founded in 1897 but has won the title in Swedenâs top league, the Allsvenskan, once, in 2001.  In 2009, Hammarby finished in last place and was relegated into the second division, the Superettan.  In 2011, Hammarby flirted with yet another relegation but was able to finish in 11th place and maintain its Superettan status for 2012.  Despite the struggles, the club remains one of the more popular teams in the country and Berhalter is now in charge of turning the club around.  âWe want to improve,â Berhalter said. âThatâs first and foremost. I want to improve the team and think of this thing as everyone is committed to getting better together and everyone is committed to the team. Once we stabilize and once we get things moving in the right direction, then the real work begins. Then we begin pushing forward a bit more.â Berhalter is yet to coach a professional game but he is already envisioning the style he wants Hammarby to play. He will keep last seasonâs interim head coach, Roger Sandberg, as his assistant.  He has a wide variety of coaches that he has learned from and he still talks to Bruce Arena every few days and expects to continue to receive advice from the former U.S. national team head coach and his mentor at the Galaxy.  Berhalter is proud of having played and learned the game in different countries and is confident this will give him his own style, which he hopes is fast-paced and dynamic.  âMy style of play and how I see the game is probably unique,â Berhalter said. âBut I have learned from all the coaches Iâve been around. But as for my style, I like a passing game, obviously. I like a quick counter attacking team that plays and moves the team forward. I like interchanging passing and interchanging positions.â âItâs easy to talk about how I want the team to play,â he quickly added. âBut the other thing is can I get the team to do that? Thatâs going to be the challenge.â Berhalterâs hiring is a milestone for American soccer because he is now the only United States-born head coach of a professional soccer team in Europe. Other Americans, like David Wagner at Borussia Dortmundâs under-23 team, have enjoyed success but were not born or raised in the United States.  Last season the American Joe Enochs was hired as interim head coach at Osnabruck as it was attempting to avoid relegation from the 2. Bundesliga. In the end, Osnabruck was relegated and Enochs was prohibited from coaching beyond the season because he did not have the requisite coaching licenses.  Berhalterâs situation is different. He will be the head coach from the start of the season and he will have an opportunity to implement his vision.  The former standout at St. Benedicts Prep in Newark and the University of North Carolina is not daunted by being the only American head coach in Europe. He believes more Americans soon follow.  âSoccer is obviously a global game and Iâve been lucky enough to have a lot of experience all around the world,â Berhalter said. âI think that I donât really feel a stigma attached to my name because Iâm American. I think that more opportunities will come for American coaches. Our coaching is excellent in America in all of our sports. They can learn a lot for us.â Berhalter is going to spend the next few months putting together his team for the coming season. The team currently has no American players, but it was the first professional club for former U.S. international Charlie Davies, who remains popular among the teamâs fans.  Berhalter is not specifically looking to sign an American, but he does not deny that it is possible given the success Davies had.  âWeâre going to look for the best possible players that fit our situation,â Berhalter said. âIf thatâs an American, then so be it. I can definitely see an American coming over here and Charlie kind of paved the way. He gave Americans a good name at Hammarby. So as far as the fans are concerned, theyâd definitely be open to having another one.â Berhalter is best remembered by American fans as being a key player on the 2002 United States World Cup team but the stage is now set for him to take the initial steps for Americans coaching in Europe.
