Advertisement By JIM BENAGH After the young season's most hectic weekend, there are still 20 unbeaten Division 1 college basketball teams, including some real surprises. Some of the unbeaten are top-25 powers: Duke, U.C.L.A., Oklahoma State, Kansas, Connecticut, Michigan State, Oklahoma, Missouri and Louisville. But the list also contains Clemson, Temple, Boston College, Syracuse, Tulane, Western Michigan, Wisconsin-Green Bay, Eastern Illinois, Washington State, Stanford and Brigham Young. Before any of the unblemished gets too excited, though, it might be pointed out that 20 is twice the number of major-college teams that managed to finish undefeated during the last 50 years. An additional 11 teams in that span made it through the regular season unbeaten, only to be felled in post-season tournaments. Making Room at the Top One reason there are    only    20 unbeaten teams at this point in the 1991-92 season is because of what happened Saturday to some of the best teams in the country. Advertisement Arizona, the team ranked No. 2 in the Associated Press poll, was beaten by No. 19 Arkansas, 65-59. Ohio State, ranked No. 4, was upset by unranked Southern Cal, 79-77, in overtime.. Advertisement Furthermore, No. 12 Michigan State needed a last-gasp shot to hold off previously unbeaten Cincinnati, 90-89, and No. 25 Louisville needed a desperation shot at the buzzer to beat Louisiana State, 93-92. Arkansas is known for its aggressive, pressing defense and it lived up to its reputation. "I think that we played the best man-to-man that we have played all year in the last part of the game," Razorback guard Lee Mayberry said after making four key free throws in the last 38 seconds to hold off Arizona. "They couldn't get a decent shot." In fact, Arizona (5-1) had a hard time getting any kind of shot on Arkansas's home court in Fayetteville. The Wildcats' three big men -- Chris Mills, Sean Rooks and Ed Stokes -- combined to make only 5 of 24 field-goal attempts. Last season, they combined for 60 points in a 12-point victory over Arkansas, now 7-2. In Los Angeles, Jim Jackson hit 8 of 16 shots and scored 28 points for Ohio State (6-1), including 22 in the second half. But he didn't get much help as the rest of his teammates hit for only 17 of 47. The night's biggest scorer, Trojan guard Harold Miner (31 points), also made the biggest play. With 11 seconds remaining in overtime, he took an alley-oop pass from Duane Cooper for the game-winner. For U.S.C. (7-1), it was the first victory over a team ranked in the top 4 since 1970, when the Trojans beat U.C.L.A.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Cincinnati (7-1) had an 18-point lead on the Spartans in East Lansing. Michigan State was saved by Kris Weshinskey's 3-pointer with 5 seconds left. It was also a lost weekend for two other top-10 teams. No. 8 Kentucky (6-2) was edged, 81-80, by No. 13 Georgia Tech (7-2) in Atlanta. And No. 10 St. John's (4-2) dropped an 82-77 decision to No. 14 Indiana (6-2) at Madison Square Garden. Sooner, and Later Oklahoma (6-0) got its well-oiled scoring machine in gear Saturday, knocking off Morgan State, 144-81 -- a 63-point margin. Well-rested after a 10-day layoff, the Sooners took 103 shots and made 55. Damon Patterson led the winners with 41 points. He had 15 points in the team's early 19-2 surge and had 33 by halftime. It didn't hurt the Sooners, who were playing at home in Norman, that Morgan State took an 0-8 record into the game. Advertisement While Oklahoma had the weekend's best outburst, Utah (9-1) took defensive honors by swamping Wichita State, 58-36, in Kansas. Utah needed the defense because it could hit only 39 percent of its own shots. The Shockers led, 19-15, before the Utes went into a zone. Georgetown (6-1) came close to matching Utah's defensive feat, beating Maryland-Eastern Shore, 79-37. It didn't hurt that the Hoyas' foe was 0-7 going into the game, and that Maryland-Eastern Shore had a brand-new coach after having lost by 37 points recently to Division III Salisbury State. Finally, earlier this month, Kansas State, which got off to a 2-0 start, was ranked No. 1 in the country by a computerized ranking service. Saturday, the Wildcats lost to Lamar, 116-75, and are now 4-2 and have the worst record in the Big Eight. Back to College The last time Steve Alford led a college basketball team, it was at the 1987 National Collegiate Athletic Association championship game. He was the guard who spearheaded Indiana to a 74-73 victory over Syracuse. Saturday night, Alford was leading a college team under different circumstances. A week ago, Ron DeCarli resigned as Manchester (Ind.) College's coach, frustrated that his team couldn't win a game. The 27-year-old Alford, who was cut by the Sacramento Kings a month ago after four years in the N.B.A., was named head coach. Alford's debut was spoiled by Kalamazoo College, 79-69, and Manchester's record fell to 0-9. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
