Advertisement  Jim McMahon, the often-injured, charismatic and controversial quarterback who was released by the San Diego Chargers last month, is intrigued by a recent contract offer from the Philadelphia Eagles, according to Steve Zucker, his agent. ''We're not going to let money get in the way,'' Zucker told The Philadelphia Inquirer on Monday. ''If Jim feels this is the right situation with the right team, we'll get it worked out. Jim's made it very clear he wants to go to a team a step away from the Super Bowl.'' McMahon would be used as a backup to Randall Cunningham, the starting quarterback, according to remarks on his weekly radio show by Coach Buddy Ryan.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
