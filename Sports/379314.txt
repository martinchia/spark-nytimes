ATLANTA — Arkansasâs postseason got off to a bad start Thursday with a report by CBS Sportsline that Razorbacks Coach John Pelphrey committed a recruiting violation. Things got worse with a 74-68 loss to Tennessee in the Southeastern Conference tournament.  Pelphrey already faced questions about his job security following an 18-13 regular season that included a 7-9 showing in the SEC West.  The report includes a picture of Pelphrey with the prep prospect Archie Goodwin, who attends Sylvan Hills High School in Arkansas, and his teammate, Trey Smith, at a high school tournament last December. N.C.A.A. rules prohibit college coaches from having off-campus contact with a prospect until July 1 following the prospect’s junior year in high school.  âWe’re certainly very sensitive to those things and take all that stuff very, very seriously,â Pelphrey said at his postgame news conference. âIt will be looked into with regards to our compliance people, and if there’s something there, we’ll certainly cooperate and be forthcoming.â In a statement, Athletic Director Jeff Long said: “We became aware of the compliance issue this morning regarding contact with prospective menâs basketball student-athletes. If the facts are as we understand them to be at this time, it would appear to be a secondary violation.”  Pelphrey is 69-59 in four seasons at Arkansas. The Razorbacks have made one N.C.A.A. tournament appearance (2008) during his tenure.   âWe’ll talk about our team tonight and we’ll talk about the SEC tournament,â Pelphrey said when asked about his job security. âThere will be a time for that reflection  here at some point in time. I look forward to it.â
