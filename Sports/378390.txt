Advertisement  The St. John's University search committee that will recommend a successor to its retired basketball coach, LOU CARNESECCA, conducted its first meeting yesterday. A source familiar with the meeting, a telephone conference call, said that the committee only spoke in general terms. The Rev. DONALD J. HARRINGTON, St. John's president, established the committee a week ago today, after Carnesecca's announcement. Offices at the university were closed yesterday at the end of the holiday period. A central issue to the recommendation, and Harrington's decision on a coach, continues to be whether to promote BRIAN MAHONEY, an assistant for 16 seasons and Carnesecca's choice, or hire a high-profile outsider with a more established record as a head coach. "Brian wants the opportunity to coach, not just the opportunity to make money," said CARMINE CALZONETTI, a former St. John's player and assistant coach and now an assistant to the vice president who supports Mahoney's promotion. "Another coach would want the opportunity to make money more than the opportunity to coach. Everyone's talking about the financial package. That's all you hear. Nobody's talking about the job."
