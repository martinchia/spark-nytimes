PARIS — Rafael Nadal of Spain defeated Andy Murray of Great Britain, 6-4, 7-5, 6-4, to reach the final round of the French Open Friday, giving him a chance to win a sixth crown at Roland Garros. Powering the ball into the deepest corners and countering Murrayâs controlled pace, Nadal broke his opponentâs serve six times en route to the victory, his 11th in 15 matches against the scrambling Scotsman and his fourth on clay. Murray, seeded fourth, managed to break Nadalâs serve only three times. He hit 35 winners, one less than Nadal. The semifinal victory by Nadal, seeded first, gives Nadal an opportunity to match Bjorn Borgâs record six championship titles between 1974 and 1981.  John Martin provided live analysis of the match:




Game, Set, Match Nadal Beats Murray, 6-4, 7-5, 6-4
 After 3 hours 14 minutes on court, Nadal steps to the line to serve for the set. He doesnât waste time, as befits a winner who wants to finish off his opponent. His first winning point is an overhead smash into a corner. His next is a slashing backhand passing shot that accelerates past Murray at net. His third point is a baseline-corner-to-baseline-corner shot that splits the court. Murray smacks a backhand into the net. Nadal jumps, walks to net, nods to Murray, then turns and lifts his arms to the sky. Patience, power, persistence paid off.   On Sunday, Nadal will face the winner of the match between Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. If  John Isner of Tampa, Fla., is watching, there must be the flicker of a smile  crossing his face about now. The American, who played college tennis at the  University of Georgia, is the only opponent in this French Open to have won a  set off Nadal. He won two, in the first round, and the match seemed to suggest  that Nadal was vulnerable. False logic there. Isner was formidable and Nadal, a  stalwart competitor, won a tough match. Now, Nadalâs putting the experience to  good use today against Murray, whose serve isnât quite as fast as Isnerâs, but  whose skill set is formidable, too. Just not enough, it seems, to derail a  speeding express train. Patience of the kind Nadal needed against Isner is  paying off. Murray hits a forehand into the net and trails, 5-3. Thereâs an old saying in tennis, donât run that far and not win the point. In the fifth game of the set, Nadal had a chance to change calamity into conquest. Murray hit a wicked cross-court drop shot, feathering the ball across the net at an almost impossible angle. Nadal raced forward to retrieve, blocked a return up the line, which Murray immediately popped into a lob. Nadal turned his back to the net and then looked over his shoulder for the ball. When he saw it, he slapped it with a backhand volley. It was a bit weak. Murray saw it coming back and hit the ball in Nadalâs direction, which was okay, because the swift-footed Spaniard misjudged the shot and sent it into the net.  For Nadal, it had been a long run for a lean result. Nadal won redemption later in the game, staving off three break points and racing to the net on a weak Murray lob. His running overhead smash would have made Pete Sampras proud.  Now  Nadalâs talking to himself, berating his failure to pop a volley over  the net to blunt a picture-perfect running cross-court backhand by  Murray. The ball falls to earth, like Nadalâs hopes for that point,  which he had carefully constructed. One construction project fails,  another succeeds. Murray maneuvers Nadal into a down-the-line mishit to  save a game point. Then Nadalâs forehand wrong foots Murray and puts  him back on top to win the game. Murray accommodates with a forehand  service return into the net. Nadal  starts skipping and running around the court, taking his towel,  brushing perspiration off, then getting in place to return serve. Heâs expectant in his posture, for good reason. After winning the second set, 7-5, Nadal and his express train are leaving the station. Nadal is forcing Murray into error after error.  Never allowing the Scotsman to lean into the match with authority. Nadal  keeps observing his rituals with the fidelity of a monk. He scrapes red  brick dust off the baseline at every opportunity. He arranges his  bottles. He tugs at his shorts. His expression says to me that he sees  the finals in the distance.  Murrayâs vision is clouded by doubt. He  slugs a beautiful inside-out forehand wide. Even though he wins his  serve, the  stationmaster is preparing to blow the whistle. Murray hits his 54th ace of the tournament to deny Nadal another service break. It would have been the fifth of the match. Murray has broken Nadal three times so far. But now Murray is talking to himself, arguing it seems, about his own errors. Nadal’s frequent visits to breakpoint land seems to be getting to Murray. His mood wonât improve after Nadal wins the break point, jumps in the air, and heads to the chair to begin his bottle maneuver. The Spaniard is about to serve for the second set.  Nearing the beginning of a third hour, Nadal takes his seat, trailing by a game. On the changeover, his ritual is fun, if not a little odd, to watch. Sometimes you can see it on television. He settles in his seat, arranges two bottles exactly the same distance apart every time. Iâd estimate four inches apart, based on the time I sat behind him at last yearâs U.S. Open final. The ritual is so exact, it defies definition as anything other than superstition carried to excruciating lengths. Since I havenât won any major international championships and only got to the Round of 16 in the U.S. National Public Parks tournament one year long ago in the 20th century, I can only marvel.  If Murray has hit two more beautiful shots in this tournament, itâs hard to imagine. He slugs two winning cross-court shots, one a backhand, one a forehand, both of them evading Nadalâs racket by yards, not inches. Then he watches Nadal double-fault on break point to lose his serve. Not likely anybody would believe that the Spanish conquistador would lose his nerve, but it happened. Now that theyâre back on serve, Murray must increase the pressure to have a chance of turning this match around. If heâs just good enough to keep holding serve, it could be a lost cause.  He pumps a couple of more unforced backhand errors into the net and stands in danger of losing his serve. So he follows conventional advice and races to net, keeping the pressure on. Bad idea. Nadal passes him with an easy backhand stroke. Murrayâs facing two break points.  After another furious (meaning uncountable) rally of many strokes, Nadal pushes a forehand over the baseline. Murrayâs gotten a minuscule reprieve. He survives. He thrives. Nadal loses focus and slams a forehand service return long and wide. Then Murray double-faults.  Who authorized these lapses? The match is crumbling into a shambles of errors and extraordinary shot-making. Nadal finds the range and pummels a forehand down the line. Murray slaps an easy forehand into the net. Gone. All the carefully constructed points. Murray canât get to another Nadal forehand and the Spaniard leaps in glee. Heâs gotten another service break. Murray ought to worry.  Now itâs Murrayâs turn to misjudge the elements. He tries a forehand drop shot, risky in calm weather much less the tempest on Chatrier, and it predictably hits the net cord and falls back on his side. Then he sails a forehand long.  Before long, Nadal is drilling a forehand crosscourt winner that takes away Murrayâs serve and shoves him a little closer to the locker room.  The trainer is called. To whom will he administer? Murrayâs right ankle has needed attention in the past. But the trainer doesnât come on court and Murray walks to his position. Whatâs going on? News at 11 or whenever we can find out.  The wind. The wind. Without a doubt, Nadal is having trouble gauging its impact. He sends a forehand just over the baseline to give Murray his service game. As the changeover ends, Murray and the chair umpire, Kader Nouni of France, exchange words without benefit of microphones.  Nadal looks around. Something is starting to spook this match. The wind. Murray doesnât like a call and Nouni jumps down to look. He likes the call. Murray looks grim and walks away. Then he pumps a backhand into the net.  Itâs facile to say something weird is happening, but words fail when winds blow in tennis. Murray pumps still another backhand into the net after the briefest of rallies. The set is tied.  Nadal lowers his head, a sign of personal disgust. Heâs lost two points in a row on weak shots that Murray either volleys away (with a picture perfect motion, allowing the ball to dance on the strings to do the work) or slugs into an unreturnable shot.  But now, with the wind kicking up, both players are struggling. Murray starts to hit a forehand but the ball doesnât come to him as expected, blown short, and he leaps forward to try to catch it. He doesnât. Then he hits a powerful forehand that dies in the wind and allows Nadal to dance in and crush a shot for a winner.  This wind could be a devilishly complicating factor if it doesnât take a seat soon and let the players have at each other.   Surprisingly, Murray is  suddenlyÂ sluggish going for a forehandÂ and hits it in the net. Nadalâs  keeping the pressure on and in a comedy of flopping and flipping, the  two players run to the net to try to capitalize on their opponentâs weak  shots, one after the other. Nadal wins the point with an  off-the-racket-head shot that clears the net and passes Murray.  That  gives him a set point and now the test is whether Nadal can construct a  point for victory. He canât. Itâs a furious rally (translation: too many  strokes to count responsibly). Nadal blows the point with a flubbed  backhand that sails into the net. Then Murray, persevering and running  Nadal side to side, gets another break point.  Good strong concentration  by the Scotsman. But not enough. He flubs a backhand on the 1,500th stroke. What a sight is Nadalâs drop shot on another break point. He  races to net and follows the teaching proâs advice: donât swing, just  let the racket wait for the ball.  In this case, Nadal let the ball touch  his strings and angled the racket slightly to let the ball pop off it  and over the net. When the set ends, itâs a Murray forehand error that  cuts off his chance to catch up. The Spaniard ascends to a one-set lead  by keeping his cool. Nadalâs relentless. But his backhand, sometimes his most potent weapon, fails him as he gets closer to set point. Then his forehand fails him, sailing a shot far over the baseline. Murrayâs break point opportunity, his fourth of the match is at hand. Nadal chokes, it seems, driving a forehand into the net and losing his serve. He wasnât pushed that much. Clearly, he needed to keep the ball in play but didnât. Murray sees some daylight.  He pops another drop shot that Nadal gives up on before getting close. Then he lets a ball drop onto a line without trying to return it. Heâs mildly disoriented and shaking his head when the chair umpire, Kader Nouni of France, rules the ball hit the line. Murrayâs still in the hole but closer to getting out of it if he can apply the pressure now. Nadalâs applying pressure and Murrayâs wincing, probably feeling a bit trapped. Nadal takes away another serving game by Murray with a series of slashing crosscourt shots that Murray isnât moving quickly enough to contain.  Heâs looking at the scoreboard statistics during the changeover and doesnât seem to like what he sees. Nadalâs hit fewer winners, 6 to Murrayâs 7, the same number of unforced errors, 6 each, yet broken Murray twice, and 22 points to Murrayâs 16.  Whatâs going on here? Murray will have to figure it out to stay in this set. An instant analysis is that Nadal is putting more pressure on the Scot than he can handle. Winning another service game, Nadal is on the doorstep.  Nadalâs staying in the points longer, meaning heâs not going for the lines as soon as Murray. This translates to a few more points won. Murray seems to hurry his shots ever so slightly. Even so, he grabs a break point opportunity by luring Nadal to net with a drop shot.  On the next point, Nadal takes it back by driving his approach shot deep and slapping a Murray lob toward his backhand. Itâs classic wrong-footing at a high level. It works. Another wrong footer puts Nadal back in control on his serve after facing two more break points. Another drop shot brings Nadal forward and Murray does the exact right thing: He pops a lob over Nadalâs head and even Nadal canât get back in time.  This is classic good tennis tactic. The crowd is appreciative. Nadalâs forehand flourish is amazing to watch. He twirls the racket like a baton, swiveling his wrist in a flamboyant circle as he meets the ball. He holds serve with relative ease, although Murray isnât far behind, pulling it to 40-30 before hitting wide. A moment later, he sends a second forehand wide. Heâll have to watch his strokes more carefully. Still later, he canât handle the high-bouncing shots Nadal is dishing out and sends a forehand long to trail, 15-30, on his serve. He wisely moves in to crush a forehand that Nadal pops up to him and itâs 30-30. Again, Murray loses focus and sets up a break point, which he squelches with an extraordinary inside-out forehand into the corner for a winner. Nadal isnât backing off and takes the deuce point, then breaks Murray with a convincing forehand down the line passing shot. Murrayâs flexing his serving muscle, hitting two aces in the first game. Itâs a good sign for Murray. He rushes net on Nadalâs backhand and it pays off: He hits a touch volley crosscourt, far out of Nadalâs reach. At 40-15, Nadal blocks a backhand wide and yields the game.  PARIS — Andy Murray of Britain enters this match as the decided underdog against Rafael Nadal of Spain. Not only has Nadal defeated Murray 10 of the 14 times they have met, but he has won their only three encounters on clay, including their last meeting two months ago in Monte Carlo. Case closed? Not yet. Murray, a perfectionist, exhibits an extraordinary drive and a set of improving talents that could enable him to score a breakthrough to victory. Statistics can lie, mislead or illuminate. Consider some from Roland Garros this year: In five matches, Murray has hit 50 aces, the most of any player in this championship. Nadal has hit 21. Murray has hit one of the fastest serves recorded here, a 134 mile-per-hour screamer (10 mph slower John Isnerâs fastest). Nadalâs top serve didnât make the top 25. Endurance? French Open statisticians record the number of strokes on every point. Murray and Nadal have both shown a talent for extending and winning long rallies. Against Viktor Troicki of Serbia, Murray won rallies that lasted 33 and 30 strokes. Against Pablo Andujar of Spain, Nadal won rallies of 32 and 30 strokes. The lesson: Both men run down balls and donât quit easily. Letâs try one final measure of competitive success: break points won. Both players are tenacious when they see an opportunity. Murray leads all players with 36 break points won. Nadal ranks close behind. He has won 33 break points. Despite Nadalâs long lead in victories, this could be a terrific match.
