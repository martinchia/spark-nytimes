Advertisement  TRACK AND FIELD  Bubka Breaks His Own Mark in Pole Vault Sergei Bubka inched closer to the outdoor 20-foot mark yesterday, soaring 19 feet 11 3/4 inches to raise his world record in the pole vault at a meet in Formia, Italy. Bubka beat his mark of 19-11 1/4 set in Moscow last month. Bubka cleared the height on his first attempt, received a thunderous ovation from the crowd, and passed on his other attempts. Each time Bubka raises the world record, he earns between $30,000 and $40,000 from meet organizers and about $90,000 from his commercial Italian sponsor. Bubka said recently that he believed he could go as high as 20-4 1/2, but he wants to do it gradually. Margarita Ponomaryeva of the Soviet Union won the women's 400-meter hurdles in 54.25 seconds, the second fastest time of the year. Kathy Freeman of the United States was second in 56.38. Mark McKoy of Canada upset former world-record holder Renaldo Nehemiah in the 110-meter hurdles. McKoy won in 13.53, .16 ahead of Nehemiah. Dannette Young scored the only United States victory in the meet, taking the women's 200-meter in 23:03 seconds. She edged Lilian Allen of Cuba and another American, Lillie Leatherwood. Cuban athletes took the men's high jump and the women's 200- and 800-meter races. African runners swept the top five places in the 10,000 meters, with Petro Metta of Tanzania winning in 28 minutes 7.70 seconds. CYCLING De Wilde Finishes First in Third Stage Etienne de Wilde of Belgium won the third stage of the Tour de France in a sprint finish yesterday, leaving Rolf Sorenson of Denmark in the overall lead and defending champion Greg LeMond of the United States in second. In contrast with Sunday's opening two stages in which LeMond and Eric Breukink staged a breakaway, today's 130.8-mile leg saw a mass finish over the flat terrain in Dijon. De Wilde went to the front a few hundred yards from the line and managed to hold on. He narrowly beat Jean-Paul van Poppel of the Netherlands and Germany's Olaf Ludwig. Sorensen retained the yellow jersey with a 10-second advantage over LeMond, who was two seconds ahead of Breukink.
