Fox Soccer analyst Warren Barton shared a peculiar thought on air last February shortly after Everton had ousted Chelsea from the F.A. Cup on penalties at Stamford Bridge. “I donât trust left-footed penalty takers,” said Barton after Evertonâs Leighton Baines and Chelseaâs Ashley Cole, two left-footers, failed to convert their attempts.   Barton would be $10 poorer today if he had bet a dollar against every left-footed penalty taker in Major League Soccer this year. Columbusâs Andres Mendoza, Houstonâs Brad Davis, Real Salt Lakeâs Fabian Espindola and Chicagoâs Sebastian Grazzini combined to give lefties a perfect 10 of 10 from the spot during the regular season, with Mendoza contributing half of that tally.  One seasonâs data is not nearly enough to dismiss Bartonâs bias, but it does reveal some interesting penalty stats. Left-footers placed 80 percent of their kicks to their natural side — the goalkeeperâs left. Davis placed all three of his penalties successfully to that corner.  Right-footers were far more likely to vary their target with 46 percent of shots going to their natural side — the goalkeeperâs right — and 35 percent going to the goalkeeperâs left. About three-quarters of these kicks were successful. The 19 percent aimed down the middle met with unblemished results. In total, right-footed players registered an 80 percent success rate: 59 of 74 kicks converted, 9 shots saved, 3 foiled by the goal frame and 3 off target. Philadelphiaâs Sebastien Le Toux successfully went to the goalkeeperâs right with all four of his penalties, including two against Dallas goalkeeper Kevin Hartman in a 2-2 tie on Aug. 13. Los Angeles Galaxyâs Landon Donovan also converted 4 of 4, splitting his kicks equally between the corners.  D.C. Unitedâs Charlie Davies, New Englandâs Shalrie Joseph and the  Golden Boot winner Dwayne De Rosario all scored on four of their five attempts. Six players tried and failed on one occasion including Red Bullsâ Thierry Henry and Rafael Marquez. Seattle Soundersâ Kasey Keller and Sporting Kansas Cityâs Jimmy Nielsen thwarted the leagueâs second- and third-highest paid players. Dallas forward David Ferreira hooked his only kick wide against Vancouver on Apr. 23 shortly before sustaining the ankle fracture that ended his season. D.C. United, with 10 penalties, was awarded the greatest number of spot kicks. Davies and De Rosario converted eight. Columbus was the most successful exponent with all nine of its kicks finding the net. Chivas USA was the only side not to receive a penalty. New England led the league in giveaways with eight penalties conceded. Davies was the only opponent to let them off the hook when he skied his kick over Matt Reisâs crossbar. Reis and Salt Lakeâs Nick Rimando both faced seven penalties without making a save, but Rimandoâs goal frame denied Seattleâs Mauro Rosales and Portland Timbersâ captain Jack Jewsbury. The Red Bulls’ discarded goalkeeper Greg Sutton proved unbeatable from 12 yards for most of his foes. The Canadian foiled Coloradoâs Jeff Larentowicz and New Englandâs Joseph, and Jewsbury struck the left post during Portlandâs 3-3 tie with the Red Bulls on June 19. Brad Davis and Vancouverâs Eric Hassli were the only players to beat Sutton from the spot before he was shunted on loan to Montreal Impact in the summer. Chicagoâs 22-year-old stopper Sean Johnson also made a couple of saves to thwart Hassli and San Jose’s Chris Wondolowski. The greatest pressure on penalty kick takers is arguably in a World Cup final shootout. Left-footers have converted 5 of 5 shootout kicks taken between the 1994 and 2006 finals combined, while right-footers have missed five of 13 attempts.  The pressure on M.L.S. players will be ratcheted up beginning Wednesday night when the postseason begins and the specter of a season-ending shootout looms. Regardless of the outcome, there seems to be little rationale for following Bartonâs gut feeling.
