Advertisement  Jerry Tarkanian, who 12 days ago ended a turbulent coaching career at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, will not be hired as head coach at San Diego State, according to a person in the university's athletic department with knowledge of the school's plans. Instead, the university is expected to hire Tom Asbury, the coach at Pepperdine, the person said. Asbury has been at Pepperdine for four seasons, and this season led his team to a 24-6 record and a berth in the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, with a first-round game against Memphis State on Thursday. Asbury, who would replace Jim Brandenburg, is expected to be named in the next several days. There had been speculation for weeks that Tarkanian had been the first choice of the San Diego State athletic director, Fred Miller, but that pressure from the academic community was swaying the university away from Tarkanian.

But the person in the athletic department said Miller had already been informed of the decision. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
