The 31-year-old Gay, who is set to return from his suspension in next week’s Diamond League meeting in Lausanne, received a reduced ban for cooperating with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency’s investigation. In a brief statement on Thursday, the IAAF says the sanction “was appropriate under the circumstances and in accordance with IAAF rules. Consequently, the IAAF decided not to exercise its right of appeal.” The World Anti-Doping Agency decided on June 4 that it would not appeal. Gay tested positive for an anabolic steroid at the U.S. championships last year. He was stripped of all of his results since July 2012. Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
