Advertisement By JOSEPH DURSO Thoroughbred racing, which in 1990 saw star horses suffer injuries and death, is opening 1991 on the same painful note. Unbridled, who won the Kentucky Derby and the Breeders' Cup Classic last year, suffered a bruised right foot recently while in training at Gulfstream Park in Florida, and his debut there on Feb. 9 has been postponed. It is believed that he might not open his 1991 season until April. This delay for Unbridled, a 4-year-old colt, carries a special sigificance because his 1991 debut had been shaping up as a racing gala: he was preparing to take the stage in the $500,000 Donn Handicap, the inaugural event in the new American Racing Championship series of 10 races for older horses. On the same day, on the same national television program, the winners of the Eclipse Awards for 1990 will be announced. And Unbridled appears to be the winter favorite to win the premier award as Horse of the Year. So, he stood to win a rich race and a historic award on the same day. But this past week, all of this unraveled when he was withdrawn from the Donn by Carl Nafzger, who trains Unbridled for France Genter of Minneapolis, the 92-year-old owner who became a television celebrity last May when her colt won the Kentucky Derby. 'Just Not Ready' Advertisement "We were aiming him for the Donn," the trainer said from Gulfstream Park. "But we had early rain a few mornings, and Unbridled doesn't like an off track, so he missed a workout. It was probably good that he did. The next day, he was a little tender in the right front foot. We found a bruise, and he missed three days of training in all. He's just not ready."

After beginning his roll of major victories last year by winning the Florida Derby at Gulfstream Park, Unbridled ended the season with a smashing victory in the Breeders' Cup Classic and with a bankroll of $3.9 million.

He also was one of the survivors of a star-crossed class. Many of the headline horses of 1990 were injured during the year, including Sunday Silence, Easy Goer, Red Ransom, Mister Frisky, Criminal Type and Housebuster. And the champion filly, Go for Wand, was one of three horses who died after mishaps in the Oct. 27 Breeders' Cup series at Belmont Park. To deepen the regret, all three of the leading horses in the Eclipse Award voting for Horse of the Year have become casualties of one sort or the other: Go for Wand, Criminal Type and now Unbridled.                --------------------          Cordero Out For a Week Angel Cordero Jr., who was injured during a two-horse spill in the fourth race at Aqueduct on Friday, reported yesterday that he might miss a week or so but that he was eager to return. "My shoulder and collarbone are separated a little," he said by telephone from his home. "I have to see a specialist Monday, then I'll know more. The X-rays showed no broken bones. I'm just body-sore, and I have a big lump on top of my shoulder." Cordero, 48 years old and the senior star of New York racing, was thrown when Modest Glow tripped over Originate in the home stretch. Originate broke a foreleg and was destroyed. His jockey, Jose Ferrer, was slightly hurt but was riding yesterday. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
