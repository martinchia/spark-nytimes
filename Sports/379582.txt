INDIANAPOLIS â When the Patriots advanced to the Super Bowl, a scheduling conflict emerged for Chad Ochocinco. Instead of asking questions at Media Day, as he has done the last two years as the lead reporter for the Ochocinco News Network, he would be answering them. Fulfilling his duties on Tuesday was Jacksonville running back Maurice Jones-Drew, who lowered his shoulders and bulled into a scrum surrounding Ochocinco to conduct the first interview for what he called âMJD-TV.â Here it is, in all its glory: MJD: So now we have it here, this is now officially MJD-TV and my first interview with the former OCNN CEO. Howâs everything going? OCHOCINO: Everything is good. A lot of cameras. A lot of mikes. A lot of questions. Most of them are somewhat common sense. But itâs cool. MJD: Iâve never been in this situation before. Iâve never been around cameras like this, all these people. Iâm in Jacksonville. OCHOCINCO: Thereâs a lot of sharks. Being nervous is like bleeding. MJD: Iâm in Jacksonville though. We donât see all this. OCHOCINCO: they swim. Everybody goes swimming. MJD: I canât swim. Could you carry me? OCHOCINCO: No, I canât carry you. I canât even carry my damnself right now. MJD: Youâre doing a good job. Youâre in the Super Bowl. Who wouldnât want to be here? OCHOCINCO: Youâre right. MJD: All that hard work we put in the summer, you donât want this? Letâs talk about all the off-the field stuff, the TV show, racing the horse, right? Bullfighting, all those things. What do you have next for us? OCHOCINCO: This offseason, Iâm getting married. MJD: Thatâs the biggest one of them all. OCHOCINCO: Thatâs the big dance. The big dance here, the big dance there. MJD: No wrestling alligators? OCHOCINCO: I own one, though. MJD: Yeah, really? Whatâs her name? OCHOCINCO: Emilio. MJD: Emilio? How big is she — or he? OCHOCINCO: About eight feet. MJD: Youâve got a picture? OCHOCINCO: No. MJD: Letâs see, whatâs another question? You going to do any running with the bulls so MJD-TV can be there to see that? OCHOCINCO: No but Iâll be in Spain this offseason. You can come. MJD: Can we fly you out there? OCHOCINCO: I already have a ticket, but you can come on. MJD: Weâve got to do something. That $3 dollar check that you took from me to buy this network, itâs going to go a long way. I told her I would add a little more class to this situation. OCHOCINCO: However you want to do it, itâs your show now. MJD: Iâll take care of it. Read more from Ben Shpigel on Chad Ochocinco at Media Day here.
