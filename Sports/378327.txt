The Falcons are 3-0 under their first-year coach, Jerry Glanville. Their previous best start in the preseason was 2-0-1 in 1967. Atlanta led by 10-7 at halftime. Then Miller teamed with Thomas to increase the lead to 17-7 with 4:31 left in the third quarter. Miller was replaced later in the period after completing 18 of 24 passes for 209 yards. The Packer quarterback, Mike Norseth, hit Clarence Weathers with a 60-yard touchdown pass on the first play of the fourth quarter, cutting the Falcons' lead to 17-14 with 14:52 left. Two Plays Overruled On the next series, the Packers' Tony Bennett apparently recovered a fumble by the Atlanta quarterback, Gilbert Renfroe. But the play, which included a return to the Falcons' 4, was overruled by video replay.
