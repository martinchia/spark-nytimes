Advertisement  GARRY MADDOX, known as the Secretary of Defense when he played center field for the Philadelphia Phillies, is campaigning to succeed BILL WHITE as president of the National League. Phillies president BILL GILESsaid he had recommended Maddox to Los Angeles Dodgers owner PETER O'MALLEY, who heads the search committee. Maddox, 42, played 15 years in the majors (1972-86) for the San Francisco Giants and the Phillies. He had a lifetime batting average of .285 and earned eight Gold Gloves. White, who announced he will leave office after this season, is the first black president of either league. Maddox, who is now a successful businessman, says he sees the job as a chance to increase minority involvement in the game. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
