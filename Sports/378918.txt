Advertisement  Time Warner Sports will begin a monthly pay-per-view boxing show with the April 19 telecast of Evander Holyfield's first defense of his heavyweight title, against George Foreman in Atlantic City. Seth Abraham, the chief executive officer of Time Warner Sports, said yesterday that future cards would run on the second Friday of every month and would feature two world championship-caliber bouts priced at under $20.
