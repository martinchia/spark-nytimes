Advertisement  Although there has been no major progress in contract talks between the New Jersey Nets and their first-round draft pick, Kenny Anderson, lines of communication remain open, according to insiders on both sides. Willis Reed, the Nets' vice president, recently relayed a modified offer to Anderson's attorney, Richard Howell of Atlanta, although the terms in years and how they would be distributed were not specific. Anderson, from Queens, is hoping to land a long-term deal that would pay him close to $3 million a season. The Nets, whose only firm offer was for five years at $2.25 million a year, are hoping to bring Anderson in at closer to $2.5 million. With three exhibition games left, including a date last night in Auburn Hills, Mich., against the Detroit Pistons, and 10 days left before the start of the regular season, the Nets continue to use their incumbent point guards, Mookie Blaylock and Tate George. Anderson, working out in Atlanta at Georgia Tech, has had Howell begin to explore alternatives, such as the possibility of playing a season in Europe.
