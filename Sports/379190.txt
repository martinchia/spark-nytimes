Advertisement  Reuter Carl Lewis used a portable phone to relate his feelings to a newspaper during Saturday's opening ceremony of the Barcelona Games. The International Olympic Committee, far from amused by Lewis's action, says it's time for him to hang up. The six-time gold medalist was in breach of the Olympic charter, the I.O.C. said today as it warned the American team to stop Lewis from acting as a journalist at the Games. I.O.C. information director Michele Verdier said there had been complaints that two athletes, Lewis and Swiss swimmer Dano Halsall, had used portable phones at the ceremony to give commentaries to newspapers with which they had contracts. She said warning letters were being sent to the United States and Swiss teams, stating that these activities breached the Olympic charter and asking for action to prevent it being repeated during the Games.
