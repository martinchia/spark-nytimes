Advertisement  The Knicks' JOHN STARKS will challenge Seattle's SHAWN KEMP, runner-up in last year's Slam-Dunk championship, and the Nets' DRAZEN PETROVIC will challenge the two-time defending 3-point Shootout champion, CRAIG HODGES of Chicago, on fun-and-games Saturday of the N.B.A. All-Star weekend, Feb. 8-9 in Orlando, Fla. The program kicks off with a Legends Classic, featuring the Hall of Famers OSCAR ROBERTSON, DAVE COWENS and RICK BARRY. The 3-point shooters will line up next, with Boston's LARRY BIRD, winner of the first three shootouts -- his bad back willing -- expected to challenge Hodges, a four-time finalist, and a field including CRAIG EHLO of Cleveland, JEFF HORNACEK of Phoenix, JIM LES and MITCH RICHMOND of Sacramento and JOHN STOCKTON of Utah, as well as Petrovic. DEE BROWN of Boston, the defending Slam-Dunk champion, is out this year because of an injury, but Kemp will lead a lineup of Starks, NICK ANDERSON of Orlando, STACEY AUGMON of Atlanta, TERRELL BRANDON of Cleveland, CEDRIC CEBALLOS of Phoenix, LARRY JOHNSON of Charlotte and DOUG WEST of Minnesota.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
