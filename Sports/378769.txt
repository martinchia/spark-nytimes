Advertisement  Two years into his career with the Cleveland Browns, about the only way LEROY KELLY was going to get into the Pro Football Hall of Fame was to drive for an hour and buy a ticket. Then JIM BROWN unexpectedly retired and Kelly rushed in,  all the way to the Hall of Fame. Today he will be inducted with Cowboys running  back TONY DORSETT and defensive tackle RANDY WHITE, Vikings Coach BUD GRANT, 49ers cornerback JIMMY JOHNSON and JACKIE SMITH, a tight end for the St. Louis Cardinals and Cowboys. After the ceremony, the Atlanta Falcons and San Diego Chargers will meet in  the annual Hall of Fame exhibition game. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
