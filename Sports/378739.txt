He and Ed Valentine of Big Blue View will be writing about the Jets and the Giants in the days leading up to the Giants-Jets game on Saturday.  Few N.F.L. coaches today can be correctly described as class acts, but for Giants Coach Tom Coughlin, the phrase fits quite well. When Coughlin started with the Giants in 2004, players knew him to be a no-nonsense drill sergeant. Since then, the coach has adjusted; his players now see him as approachable, even affable. Coughlin meets with players regularly in one-on-ones. Though he has softened, Coughlin will still do what he deems right â as evidenced by his benching of Ahmad Bradshaw for the first half against Dallas two weeks ago, over breaking team rules. It was a game the Giants could ill afford to lose, but Coughlin stood by his principles. Still, there must be a reason the words âTom Coughlinâ and âjob securityâ have been part of a refrain over each of the last four seasons. The Giantsâ Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots in 2008 was nothing short of remarkable, but David Tyreeâs famous catch occurred just a month after grave questions circulated about Coughlinâs viability with the Giants. His Super Bowl win tamped the doubts â until the next fall. Too often Giants fans on sports talk radio chide Rex Ryan over what he says and does. Callers say Ryan talks too much and should be more about winning than about sound bites, the way Coughlin is. The contradiction is that for all the lectures about winning and principles that Big Blueâs fans administer, many fail to support their own coach. The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
