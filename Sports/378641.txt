ARLINGTON, Tex. â Pressure was a popular topic in the Rangersâ clubhouse Friday. Predictably, nobody would admit to feeling any for Game 6. âThe only pressure, if any that would be on us, is whatever we put on ourselves,â outfielder David Murphy said. âI donât see why the pressure would be on us. Weâre not one loss away from elimination.â Maybe so, but doesnât somebody have to feel the heat Saturday night?

The Rangers referred to a similar Game 6 situation here in last yearâs A.L.C.S., when they ousted the Yankees and reached the first World Series in franchise history. âWe gained a lot of experience last year,â Michael Young said. âWe played a lot of hard-fought games. We knew what to expect coming into this postseason. Nothingâs really taken us by surprise.â Texas tied with the Yankees for best home record in the American League at 52-29 and bashed around most opponents. During the regular season, the Rangers averaged 6.1 runs at home and 4.4 runs on the road. That gap has closed in the postseason: in four home games, Texas is averaging 4.5 runs while still scoring 4.4 in away games. Not that the Tigers are intimidated in what will be their third elimination game. See: Game 5 at Yankee Stadium in the division series. See: Game 5 on Thursday night in Detroit. âWeâre pretty relaxed as a whole,â said Max Scherzer, the Tigersâ starting pitcher Saturday night. âWeâre not really fazed by any of the situations thatâs been presented to us.â Scherzer pitched six innings, struck out six Rangers and allowed three runs in his start at the Ballpark in Game 2, which was tied at 3-3 in the 11th inning when Nelson Cruz won it with a grand slam. Asked which team faces more pressure, Scherzer embraced the entire concept. âItâs an awesome atmosphere,â Scherzer said. âItâs such an electric stadium. The fans are tremendous, and it just makes it so much more exciting to play in this type of moment. I think weâre all chomping at the bit to be able to play Game 6.â The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
