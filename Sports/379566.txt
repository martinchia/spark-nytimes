Lawrence Tynes kicked a 31-yard field goal almost eight minutes into overtime Sunday to give the Giants a 20-17 victory over the San Francisco 49ers in the N.F.C. championship game at Candlestick Park. It was the second time in four years that Tynes had kicked an overtime field goal to send the Giants to the Super Bowl. This time, just as in 2008, his kick earned the Giants a date with the New England Patriots in the N.F.L.’s championship game. Eli Manning, who was the M.V.P. when the Giants beat the Patriots in that previous meeting, completed 32 of 58 passes for 316 yards and 2 scores, including a 17-yarder to Mario Manningham in the fourth quarter that gave the Giants a 17-14 lead. But San Francisco drove right back down the field to tie the score with a field goal, and the teams probed like boxers over the final minutes of regulation and the early part of overtime.  By then, the defenses had begun to assert themselves, and neither Manning nor 49ers quarterback Alex Smith could break loose for the one big play that might have won it. Instead, the game turned when the Giants’ Jacquian Williams knocked the ball out of the hands of 49ers returner Kyle Williams on a punt in overtime, and Devin Thomas dived on the ball at the San Francisco 26. Ahmad Bradshaw coolly ran the ball in closer for Tynes, and his kick won it — just as it did at Lambeau Field in  the 2008 N.F.C. championship game in Green Bay. Now he and the Giants will try to repeat their victory over the Patriots in the Super Bowl in two weeks. Times reporters and editors provided live analysis of Sunday’s N.F.C. Championship game between the Giants and the 49ers at Candlestick Park. Earlier, the Patriots beat the Ravens, 23-20, in the A.F.C. Championship game when Baltimore kicker Billy Cundiff missed a 32-yard field goal that would have tied the score in the final seconds. You can relive that game as it happened here, or read on to do the same with the Giants-49ers game.  


10:35 P.M.It’s GOOOOOOOD!!!! Giants win, 20-17


A low snap but Weatherford corrals it and Tynes drills it true! The Giants win, 20-17.
The Giants are going back to the Super bowl — to face the Patriots!
Just like last time. Wow.




10:34 P.M.Make that a 31-yarder


Delay of game penalty.




10:32 P.M.Here comes Tynes to win it


DeOssie to snap, Weatherford to hold. It’ll be a 26-yarder.




10:31 P.M.Two runs by Bradshaw — to the 10!


They’re centering the ball for Tynes, who sent them to the Super Bowl four years ago with an overtime field goal in Green Bay.




10:27 P.M.FUMBLE on the punt! Giants ball!


Jacquian Williams reaches in on the punt and knocks the ball away from Kyle Williams — Devin Thomas falls on it!!!
The Giants take over at the 24. They are already in field goal range. What a disaster — the second turnover for Williams today on a punt, which is too bad because he’s looked good at times.
But he barely got touched there — Jacquian Williams just reached over and jabbed the ball out.




10:26 P.M.Manning SACKED on third-and-3!


Justin Smith just bulls his way in and hauls him down. The 49ers’ sixth sack of the day.




10:21 P.M.Manning to Beckum for the first down


A 6-yard run by Bradshaw and a short pass to Beckum and the Giants get a fresh set of downs in the 49ers’ logo.




10:20 P.M.Davis for 11, on third-and-12


The Giants will start at the 36 after the punt. The change of field position on those possessions helps them a lot.




10:16 P.M.Jernigan drops, but wouldn’t have been a first down


So the Giants will punt, and San Francisco can win it. Well, next team to score can win it, so Ed Hochuli’s coin-toss soliloquy was all for naught.




10:16 P.M.Deep ball from Manning early


After a first down throw to Hynoski, Manning throws long. But for the second time today, two 49ers collide and prevent an interception by slamming into one another.


@FO_MTanier Michael Tanier
Niners signature defensive play: two DBs crash, no interception, 1 is hurt.
Mon Jan 23 3:15:39  via Michael Tanier






10:13 P.M.Call your playoff hero now


The last overtime playoff game was, of course, the Broncos’ win over the Steelers in the wild-card round. If the 49ers win that day, they may have to build them a new stadium. 




10:09 P.M.Walker catches it, but tackle ends regulation


Remember, there are new overtime rules. Unless there’s a touchdown on the first possession, both teams will get a chance at the ball.
Boy, a lot of Ed Hochuli tonight. He looooves to talk, doesn’t he?
Giants win the toss, so they’ll get the chance for the first three-and-out. (Kidding, but not really after those last few minutes.)




10:07 P.M.Tuck sacks Smith


Harbaugh takes his final timeout with 4 seconds left, so they will chuck it and hope for a penalty throw a carefully designed long pass downfield on the final play.




10:06 P.M.Timeout SF: 12 seconds left


Short pass to Gore didn’t really help there.




10:04 P.M.29-yard punt by Weatherford


Williams returns it to the 26.
Remember, San Francisco only needs 3 here, and Fox just mentioned that Akers’s career-long is 57 yards. So they only need to gain about 25 yards here.




10:03 P.M.27 seconds left; Giants punting


They take a delay of game to help Weatherford try to pin the 49ers inside the 10 for the last half-minute.
Can’t say these teams haven’t had chances to win this game. One of them will regret failing to take advantage in the closing minutes here.




10:00 P.M.Manning holds, holds, holds …


.. and hits Bradshaw at the 48 just before three Niners clobber him. Manning may have the best survival clock in football; he knows just when to get rid of the ball before he gets slaughtered.
And boy did he get hit. Ended up with a shoulder pad outside his jersey and his chinstrap covering his mouth. But picked up the first down.




9:58 P.M.Quick three and out for Smith


His last pass sails over the head of Delanie Walker, who appeared to have no idea it was coming. Now 1:29 left as Andy Lee punts, and the coverage team smothers the Giants inside the 20.
Manning again, though now overtime looms. 




9:55 P.M.Manning wanted Cruz, but missed him


Ball curled to Cruz’s back shoulder and he fell diving for it at midfield. That said, he was covered by two guys there, so no guarantees.
Back to you Alex. 




9:53 P.M.Third-and-15: Manning’s wheelhouse


Oddly, he may have the 49ers right where he wants them here on third-and-15. During the timeout, he goes to the sideline and reaches into the magic box that holds the 16-yard pass play to Victor Cruz that they always seem to pull out here. They keep it safe in a red velvet sleeve just for occasions like this.




9:51 P.M.49ers strip Bradshaw, but whistle had blown


Good thing for Giants, too, because 49ers fell on it. But Bradshaw’s progress had been stopped, so it’s the right call.
Two-minute warning.




9:50 P.M.First-and-10 to second-and-21


Willis buries Manning.




9:48 P.M.Kiwanuka SACKS Smith! Three and out for SF


So Smith lets his big moment pass: incompletion, Gore for 3, sack. 
He may come to regret that. Giants take over at the 26 with 3:04 left and two timeouts. Manning knows what to do here. 




9:45 P.M.Three and out for Giants


They punt it back with 4:15 left. It goes out at the San Francisco 35.
Alex Smith, paging Alex Smith: your moment may have arrived.




9:40 P.M.Third-and-5 at the 10 for 49ers; Nope, FG


And they don’t get it. So David Akers comes on for a 20-yard chip shot.
He bangs it through, tying the score at 17-17 with 5:39 left.
If Saints-Niners was any guide, we’ve still got two or three lead changes left.




9:38 P.M.Kendall Hunter 18 yards to the 15


Boy, the 49ers don’t like to think about field goals, do they? They want touchdowns. 
The Saints made the same mistake the Giants are making — they assumed Harbaugh would be practical and just tie the score and continue the fight. But Harbaugh wants to win.




9:36 P.M.Giants lined up like they were daring Smith there …


… and he almost made them pay. Smith just missed Delanie Walker going long down the left side, but a penalty on the Giants gives them a first down anyway.
Then Smith takes off out of the shotgun when the pocket evaporates and races 17 yards to the 32. Now under eight minutes left.




9:33 P.M.Kyle Williams is NOT broken up


He grabs the kickoff after Manningham’s touchdown and races to the 45 — great starting position for Smith and the offense. Bad mistake? Might have blown the game? Not me. And who cares anyway? 
A closer like Mariano Rivera or Brian Wilson couldn’t have brushed off a mistake faster than that.




9:31 P.M.TOUCHDOWN — Manningham!!!


Doug Mills/The New York TimesMario Manningham reeled in a scoring pass from Eli Manning to temporarily give the Giants the lead.
A couple runs and a couple throws move the Giants marginally closer and then Manning throws deep middle for Manningham — TOUCHDOWN! A 17-yard score gives the Giants the lead back, at 17-14, with 8:34 left.
And if you’ve watched any Giants football this season, that should not have surprised you in the least. 
The only surprise was that Cruz didn’t catch it.




9:24 P.M.Giants ball!!!


They get it at the 29, where they touched it, since they can’t advance it. 
But this could be a huge moment in this game. If Giants score, and win, they’ll have to give a game ball to the inventor of the super slo-mo cam.
Scoring, though, could be difficult the way the San Francisco defense has awakened.




9:23 P.M.Coughlin challenges


Devin Thomas gets credit for getting down there and being alert enough to grab the ball and make a stink about it.


@FO_MTanier Michael Tanier
Kyle Williams must be numb in that knee.
Mon Jan 23 2:27:04  via Michael Tanier






9:20 P.M.Punt may have hit a 49er; review?


The game goes to commercial with a dispute about whether the ball hit the 49ers punt returner, Kyle Williams, or merely bounced free and was picked up (or I should say downed) by the Giants. 
Ruling on the field is no touch, and 49ers ball. With about 11 minutes left, that call (or its reversal) deep in 49ers territory could be a massive call.
Fox’s Mike Pereirra seems to think it hit him.




9:19 P.M.Still looks like Niners have extra players on D


Maybe it’s the red jerseys. Just seems like they are everywhere. 
Backpedaling near his goal line, Manning whipped that last pass out like he couldn’t wait to get to the sideline and regroup.




9:14 P.M.Must be an East Coast-West Coast thing


Oy. Consecutive commenters accuse me of 1. being a 49ers fan and 2. of East Coast bias. 
At least my mom still loves me. (But then, she’s a Patriots fan, so she has nothing to complain about today.)




9:08 P.M.A little outdated, but still true





@timkawakami Tim Kawakami
Alex Smith has more rushes (5) than completed passes (3). And could easily win this game with 2 or 3 key completions here.
Mon Jan 23 1:44:35  via Tim Kawakami


Chris Canty helps him out on the final play of the third quarter by drawing a 15-yard penalty.
Heading to the fourth: 49ers 14, Giants 10. San Francisco ball.




9:06 P.M.49ers’ Brown Is Helped Off


ThearonW. Henderson/Getty ImagesTarell Brown was able to walk off the field.
Brown, who hit Dashon Goldson like a tidal wave, stays down. But now he’s walking off with help.
That hit was so bad Harbaugh came out to check on him. Good to see him up. (Trainers were chuckling with Harbaugh, so it does not appear to be serious.)
But the hit did its job; the Giants punt it away.




9:01 P.M.49ers look like they’re playing with 14 guys


They are shoving the Giants’ offensive line around up front, and flying around in the secondary. Manning just threw a midrange ball into coverage and FOUR GUYS had a chance to intercept it. One of them would have, too, if Tarell Brown hadn’t slammed into a teammate in midair.
That looked like a car crash.




8:55 P.M.49ers really turned up the pressure there


The touchdown seems to have revived the 49ers, who sack Manning on third down to force a punt. The Giants really could have used a longer drive there, just to settle things down. Now they’ll really need to stand up and make sure they don’t let the 49ers drive down and open up some breathing room.




8:52 P.M.Bill Cowher saw that score coming





@CowherCBS Bill Cowher
Surprised I haven’t seen more screens. It slows down a pass rush.
Mon Jan 23 1:41:07  via Bill Cowher






8:47 P.M.Smith deep for Davis — TOUCHDOWN!


Doug Mills/The New York TimesVernon Davis hauled in his second touchdown of the game to give the 49ers a 14-10 lead.
Vernon Davis comes in motion right to left and takes off — getting behind Kenny Phillips — where Smith finds him. He leaps for a perfectly lofted ball at the goal line and hauls it in — TOUCHDOWN!! His second of the day, and just like that — good return, quick screen, deep ball — the 49ers are back in the lead at 14-10 with 5:18 left in the third quarter.
UPDATED: On replay, Phillips clearly thought he was getting safety coverage, which is why he let Davis go. Unfortunately, the safety didn’t know that.




8:46 P.M.Gore gets 24, to the Giants 30


He appeared, open, in the flat, and even Smith couldn’t miss that today. He rambles 24 yards.




8:43 P.M.Williams almost broke that return


Kyle Williams, who is handling the returns in place of the injured Ted Ginn, had a seam and a head of steam. What he needed was a better set of cleats; one cut and he was down, but he still gives the 49ers the ball at their 46 with just under seven minutes left in the third quarter.
In a 3-point game where his offense needs all the help it can get, that counts as a big play.




8:36 P.M.The Giants just look more poised


Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesSan Francisco quarterback Alex Smith with Coach Jim Harbaugh. With the exception of one long pass, Smith struggled against the Giants defense.
They are playing — on both sides of the ball — like they’ve been in this spot before.
Which many of them have.
In fact, they essentially been playing playoff games since they faced the Jets at Christmas. The 49ers haven’t, and it looks it.




8:29 P.M.Small victory: 49ers 7, #uswnt 6 at half


The United States women’s national team, which is competing in the Concacaf Olympic qualifying tournament in Vancouver, is up 6-0 at halftime of its game against Guatemala. They won 14-0 in their opener. The 49ers are just hoping to get to 14 at this point.




8:26 P.M.No secrets for Giants


Doug Mills/The New York TimesVictor Cruz had 125 yards receiving in the first half and helped set up both Giants scores.
Manning completed passes to seven receivers in the first half, and finished it 16 of 27 for 181 yards.
Alex Smith, meanwhile, was only 2 of 7 for 79 yards. But one of them was the 73-yard touchdown to Davis. So their passing game was, well, disappointing.
Frank Gore had 46 yards on nine carries, so they didn’t run it much better. Part of the problem was that they barely had the ball.




8:25 P.M.Well, now it’s under way


Still: Giants 10, 49ers 7.




8:24 P.M.Second half under way


For those complaining that I don’t have the score in every update, it’s still 10-7 Giants.




8:14 P.M.Victor Cruz should have been drafted





@SamBorden Sam Borden
Cruz goes 8 for 125 in the first half. I’m no expert, but that seems good.
Mon Jan 23 1:09:35  via Sam Borden






8:08 P.M.FIELD GOAL! Giants lead, 10-7


Tynes hits from 31 yards with 2 seconds left in the half.




8:06 P.M.Cruz to the 12


Clock running, but Manning spikes it to run the field goal unit on. For second play in a row, the Giants seemed to forget they are out of timeouts. Manning tried to take one and got a delay penalty a second ago. Then he saves Tynes’s bacon, because he had run out to try the field goal on the final play without realizing the clock hadn’t stopped.
But Manning saw him and his holder turning to sprint back, and stalled the snap (and spike) til they were safely back on the sideline.




8:05 P.M.Cruz again! He’s over 100 now


Manning steps up and find Cruz again (do the 49ers not watch tape?) and the Giants are at the 22 now.
There are 20 seconds left, so they can try a couple passes before a kick.




8:04 P.M.One minute left in the half


Manning hits Cruz for 15 yards, just on the other side of the 50. But the Giants have to use their last timeout to stop the clock. Manning them tries Manningham before going back to his security blanket, Cruz, for 11.




8:00 P.M.Giants will get one last crack in the half


With the ball deep in their end, the 49ers seemed to be trying to figure out a way to get to halftime without giving the ball back to the Giants.
But they couldn’t do it. So Andy Lee punts it back with 1:36 left. The Giants get it about the 35.




7:54 P.M.About those stadium lights at Candlestick


Much discussion so far. Sam Borden was concerned.


@SamBorden Sam Borden
It’s pretty dark out there — I am guessing it’s something wrong with the lights. Would have to think they should be on by now.
Mon Jan 23 0:21:30  via Sam Borden


So he and Judy Battista looked into it:


@judybattista Judy Battista
Am told no issue with the lights here.
Mon Jan 23 0:47:27  via Judy Battista




@SamBorden Sam Borden
Told that apparently the lights are configured for baseball, so not all of them turn on for football.
Mon Jan 23 0:47:40  via Sam Borden


Which was a totally plausible explanation, except for …


@PostBroncos Lindsay Jones
@SamBorden They realize they have a whole different stadium for baseball in this city, right?
Mon Jan 23 0:48:42  via Lindsay Jones


So the mystery remains.




7:51 P.M.Can’t spell elite without e-l-i





@FO_MTanier Michael Tanier

7:49 P.M.@NYTJohnBranch Here’s one for you


No groin pulls on that last pass to Cruz.




7:41 P.M.Vernon Davis: 1 TD, 2 personal fouls


He got one for the celebration after his touchdown, and just got a second for jumping into a shoving match between Michael Boley and several other 49ers.
 




7:36 P.M.Player to watch: Giants have a new center





@JSablichNYT Justin Sablich
One of the ugliest extra points I’ve seen in awhile, weather is real nasty. Wonder how Kevin Boothe is going to hold up at center #giants
Mon Jan 23 0:34:39  via Justin Sablich






7:32 P.M.Take 2 — TOUCHDOWN!!


Doug Mills/The New York TimesHakeem Nicks couldn’t corral this pass from Eli Manning in the end zone, but the Giants still scored a touchdown on the drive.
Manning buys time on second down, then flips the ball forward to a wide-open Bear Pascoe. A 6-yard TOUCHDOWN! Tie game.




7:30 P.M.First-and-goal for Giants at the 6


Manning loses his center (Baas) but keeps on going: to Cruz for Nicks (and another third-down conversion) and to Nicks for 9. Jacobs rushed 2 yards to the 6, and it’s first-and-goal.




7:24 P.M.Manning deep to Cruz!


The first play of the second quarter is a doozy — Manning 36 yards to Victor Cruz, who got behind Carlos Rogers.
A better ball and he would have followed the footprints left by Davis down that same sideline. Instead, he slows up for the ball and is hauled down at the 49ers 35.




7:21 P.M.Nicks better, but now Davis is achy


Nicks is back on the Giants’ sideline, but Vernon Davis is showing 49ers trainers his lower back.
The teams have switched ends after the first quarter. Giants say they want the “dry” end this quarter.


@SamBorden Sam Borden
There is probably a more eloquent way to say this but: It is freaking POURING here.
Mon Jan 23 0:18:05  via Sam Borden






7:16 P.M.49ers FUMBLE! Risky move, but they keep it


The 49ers call a reverse on first down (guess we’re done with the conservative play-calling) and Kendall Hunter loses the ball right in front of Umenyiora, but he can’t get the handle on it before the 49ers cover it.


@judybattista Judy Battista
Certainly Jim Harbaugh knows more about play-calling than most of us, but that call in this weather?
Mon Jan 23 0:17:38  via Judy Battista






7:14 P.M.Fourth-and-1, Giants go


The Giants, at that netherworld that is the opposing 34, go for it on fourth down. But Jacobs is stopped for no gain as he dives up the middle, and the ball goes back to the 49ers.
Tough to kill Coughlin there; no way they were kicking a 50-yard field goal into the wind and rain on this field. Feel free to kill Jacobs, however, who ought to be able to get a yard just by leaning forward at his size.




7:11 P.M.Nicks heads to locker room (shoulder?)


The Giants get to midfield on a catch by Nicks, but he gets up with his right shoulder hanging and runs straight to the sideline.
Now he’s gone to the locker room.


@judybattista Judy Battista
Pouring and the wind is blowing hard in the Giants’ faces now.
Mon Jan 23 0:10:35  via Judy Battista






7:04 P.M.After review — still a TOUCHDOWN!


A very precise explanation by Ed Hochuli, but here’s the short version: he didn’t see enough to overturn the call on the field, so it’s a touchdown. So San Francisco leads, 7-0.


@SamBorden Sam Borden
Eddie Guns with a personal essay, the upside of which is that the TD stands.
Mon Jan 23 0:04:26  via Sam Borden


Just like last week’s fumble controversies in Green Bay, you probably haven’t heard the last of that decision.




7:02 P.M.Did Davis step out? Under review


The plays under review, and a quick Fox replay makes it look as if Davis stepped on the sideline as he ran away from Rolle.
This could be the Giants second HUUUUUUUGGGE break in four plays.
Doug Mills/The New York TimesThe Niners’ Vernon Davis raced 73 yards for the first score of the game.




7:00 P.M.TOUCHDOWN 49ers — Davis runs free!


Brutal mistake in the Giants secondary as Vernon Davis just sprint past Antrel Rolle down the right sideline.
He sprints 73 yards — untouched and untroubled — to the end zone. TOUCHDOWN!




6:58 P.M.Jason Pierre-Paul jumps offside — by three hours


Good news Giants fans. Jason Pierre-Paul bounced out of bed this morning fired up. Ready to go. You could almost picture him stalking around his hotel room screaming, “Wooooo! Letsgoletsgoletsgo!!”

Let’s put aside for a moment that “8hrs And 60min” is actually, uh, nine hours. The bigger problem is that Pierre-Paul apparently forgot to reset his watch when he got to San Francisco on Saturday. Fortunately for him, Twitter has a built-in corrections department, otherwise known as the rest of Twitter.


@DCFanaticsBlog DCFanatic
@DatBoyJPP You have 12 hours until you game starts bro.

@DCFanaticsBlog you right thought it was at 12pm
Sun Jan 22 11:25:39  via Jason Pierre-Paul


It was his last pregame post. Good thing Tom Coughlin’s not on Twitter. 




6:56 P.M.Manning stripped — FUMBLE!


Giants dodge a huge bullet as McDonald runs down Manning from behind on third down and strips the ball.
It bounces free, and a 49er dives on it, but it squirts out and Kareem McKenzie at the 30. The Giants lose 13 yards, but avoid an early disaster. Instead, they are thrilled to punt it away.




6:54 P.M.Third down? You mean first down


Manning now 2 for 2 on third-down conversions, finding Hakeem Nicks on the right sideline on third-and-8.
When they run, though, they get nowhere. The 49ers linebackers are just so good.




6:52 P.M.Giants, meanwhile, come out throwing


Manning goes deep over the middle with one of his first throws, then find Victor Cruz for 12 yards and a first down.




6:48 P.M.Giants force a punt


It’s a good one, so Giants will start at the 16 after a short return.




6:45 P.M.49ers playing it safe early


Thearon W. Henderson/Getty ImagesThe 49ers’ Kendall Hunter was tied up by the Giants’ Spencer Paysinger.
A handoff to Frank Gore and a short pass to him out of the backfield from Alex Smith, then a run by Kendall Hunter. Both coordinators said they would call the game differently because of the conditions, but the sloppy track is expected to be more of a problem for the Giants, who have feasted on big plays this season.




6:41 P.M.The Giants will kick off


San Francisco will get first crack with the wet ball. 




6:40 P.M.It’s pouring in San Francisco by the way


It’s got to be a factor, no? But how? And when? That’ll be the question.




6:38 P.M.Kristin Chenoweth with the anthem — slooooowly


Not as bad as Steven Tyler in Foxboro earlier today, but man: does anyone just sing the song anymore?
Quick tip: the anthem’s not about you. It’s about all of us.
(To be fair, Chenoweth didn’t butcher it the way some do.)




6:28 P.M.Jimmy Johnson picks the 49ers. Why, you ask?


The Fox analyst Jimmy Johnson just said the N.F.C. game “will be decided by the team that tackles the best.” Groundbreaking. Though I still think it will be decided in the traditional way, by the team that scores the most points.
That’s like Tom Brady analysis. Brady just told the crowd in Foxborough that “I pretty much sucked today.”




6:23 P.M.Rainy? They could cover field with Wilfork’s t-shirt


If it rains hard in San Francisco, I hope they have one of those A.F.C. Champions t-shirts Vince Wilfork is wearing in Foxborough to stretch over the stadium. That’d keep the players, the field and the fans dry.




6:10 P.M.Hope Cundiff’s locker isn’t near Ray Lewis’s


Because Cundiff just missed a last-second field goal that would have tied the A.F.C. title game.  A 32-yarder. 
“Uh, sorry Ray. My bad. No hard feelings?”
The Patriots are back in the Super Bowl. Only question now is who will join them.




6:03 P.M.N.F.C. injury report: Ginn is out for 49ers


In what is a positive, though not unexpected development, for the Giants, Ted Ginn Jr. will not play today for the 49ers. Ginn is more dangerous in his role as a returner than as a receiver, but he hurt his knee against the Saints last week and was unable to recover.
Tight end Delanie Walker will play, however, and might see a few more balls if the Giants blanket Vernon Davis. Walker is returning from a broken jaw sustained on Christmas Eve. But even though that was a month ago, the idea of getting hit by a linebacker with even the remains of that injury just sounds painful.
Linebacker Mark Herzlich (ankle) is the only Giants casualty. Tight end Jake Ballard (knee), who has been in and out, will play.




5:53 P.M.Twitter says it’s down for maintenance


Can the N.F.L. still hold a playoff game without Twitter in this day and age?
If a touchdown is scored and no one is there to Tweet it, does it still count for 6 points?




4:55 P.M.Pregame reading for Giants-49ers


Bill Pennington wrote about Giants Coach Tom Coughlin in Sunday’s Times, an in-depth (and, let’s be frank, a little frightening) look at the exacting methods and attention to detail that have helped the coach be successful.
Mike Perkins was one of the first people Tom Coughlin hired as he built an N.F.L. franchise in Jacksonville during the mid-1990s. When the Jaguarsâ stadium was nearly complete, Coughlin ordered Perkins, the son of the former Giants coach Ray Perkins, onto the new field to calculate how many steps there were from the home sideline to the locker room. 
âHe wanted to know exactly how long it would take to get into the locker room at halftime,â said Perkins, who assumed a multitude of football duties in his first year at Jacksonville. âWe did time trials â 19 seconds, 20 seconds. I thought he was nuts.â
Next, Perkins was helping design the office rooms where coaches would watch game videos. Coughlin was worried about how far the seats would be from the video screen.
âHe had me call other teams in the league and ask them how far their screens were from their chairs,â Perkins said.
âPeople thought I was nuts. They had to go measure â seven feet, eight feet. Tom decided on seven feet.â
Randy Edsall remembers his first 1976 practice at Syracuse when Coughlin was his quarterbacks coach.
âWe were doing dropback drills,â said Edsall, now the head coach at Maryland. âUnder center, Tom told us that we should imagine both feet at high noon on a clock face. When we drop back, his instructions were to take our first step back and at 4 oâclock.
âLater that day, weâre watching practice tape and Tom is getting on me big time. âRandy, youâre stepping back at 3:30, not 4 oâclock.â Iâm 17 years old and I thought, âWhat is the deal with this guy?â â 

While you chuckle, remember that Coughlin’s methods have produced one Super Bowl title and have the Giants two wins from another. Just saying. 
Ron Kroichick of the San Francisco Chronicle profiles the sometimes superhuman 49ers defensive end Justin Smith, who grew up on a farm in Missouri after his father saved his life by putting him in a capsule and firing it toward Earth just before their home planet Krypton exploded. O.K., that part isn’t true, but some parts of Smith’s body of work are hard to believe too:

The cult mostly hinges on the crazy-athletic plays Smith, at 6-foot-4 and 285 pounds, keeps making. First he chased down fleet Eagles wide receiver Jeremy Maclin and punched the ball loose for a game-clinching fumble on Oct. 2. Then he batted down Eli Manning’s fourth-down pass to preserve a win over the Giants on Nov. 13.
Those plays served as a prelude to what Smith did early in the fourth quarter of San Francisco’s riveting playoff victory over New Orleans. He drove into Bushrod, a 315-pound Pro Bowl tackle, and kept driving until they were both within sniffing distance of Saints quarterback Drew Brees.
Smith, still engaged with Bushrod, reached out with his right hand, grabbed Brees by the collar and pulled him down as he threw a hurried, incomplete pass.
“It’s nothing new – we’ve seen him do that to a million different tackles,” 49ers offensive tackle Joe Staley said. “I’m just glad he’s on our team. I’d hate to have to match up against Justin.”

Monte Poole of the San Jose Mercury News is picking the 49ers today, and he’s doing it for one reason only:
While I believe Manning is superior in most ways to 49ers quarterback Alex Smith, I don’t think there is a vast difference. If Manning is at the top of the league’s second tier of passers, Smith has risen to the bottom of that group. Each is aided by solid runners.
The greatest difference between these teams is on the other side of the ball. The 49ers are appreciably better than the Giants.

Enjoy. 


 A low snap but Weatherford corrals it and Tynes drills it true! The Giants win, 20-17. The Giants are going back to the Super bowl — to face the Patriots! Just like last time. Wow. Delay of game penalty. DeOssie to snap, Weatherford to hold. It’ll be a 26-yarder. They’re centering the ball for Tynes, who sent them to the Super Bowl four years ago with an overtime field goal in Green Bay. Jacquian Williams reaches in on the punt and knocks the ball away from Kyle Williams — Devin Thomas falls on it!!! The Giants take over at the 24. They are already in field goal range. What a disaster — the second turnover for Williams today on a punt, which is too bad because he’s looked good at times. But he barely got touched there — Jacquian Williams just reached over and jabbed the ball out. Justin Smith just bulls his way in and hauls him down. The 49ers’ sixth sack of the day. A 6-yard run by Bradshaw and a short pass to Beckum and the Giants get a fresh set of downs in the 49ers’ logo. The Giants will start at the 36 after the punt. The change of field position on those possessions helps them a lot. So the Giants will punt, and San Francisco can win it. Well, next team to score can win it, so Ed Hochuli’s coin-toss soliloquy was all for naught. After a first down throw to Hynoski, Manning throws long. But for the second time today, two 49ers collide and prevent an interception by slamming into one another. @FO_MTanier Michael Tanier Niners signature defensive play: two DBs crash, no interception, 1 is hurt. Mon Jan 23 3:15:39  via Michael Tanier The last overtime playoff game was, of course, the Broncos’ win over the Steelers in the wild-card round. If the 49ers win that day, they may have to build them a new stadium.  Remember, there are new overtime rules. Unless there’s a touchdown on the first possession, both teams will get a chance at the ball. Boy, a lot of Ed Hochuli tonight. He looooves to talk, doesn’t he? Giants win the toss, so they’ll get the chance for the first three-and-out. (Kidding, but not really after those last few minutes.) Harbaugh takes his final timeout with 4 seconds left, so they will chuck it and hope for a penalty throw a carefully designed long pass downfield on the final play. Short pass to Gore didn’t really help there. Williams returns it to the 26. Remember, San Francisco only needs 3 here, and Fox just mentioned that Akers’s career-long is 57 yards. So they only need to gain about 25 yards here. They take a delay of game to help Weatherford try to pin the 49ers inside the 10 for the last half-minute. Can’t say these teams haven’t had chances to win this game. One of them will regret failing to take advantage in the closing minutes here. .. and hits Bradshaw at the 48 just before three Niners clobber him. Manning may have the best survival clock in football; he knows just when to get rid of the ball before he gets slaughtered. And boy did he get hit. Ended up with a shoulder pad outside his jersey and his chinstrap covering his mouth. But picked up the first down. His last pass sails over the head of Delanie Walker, who appeared to have no idea it was coming. Now 1:29 left as Andy Lee punts, and the coverage team smothers the Giants inside the 20. Manning again, though now overtime looms.  Ball curled to Cruz’s back shoulder and he fell diving for it at midfield. That said, he was covered by two guys there, so no guarantees. Back to you Alex.  Oddly, he may have the 49ers right where he wants them here on third-and-15. During the timeout, he goes to the sideline and reaches into the magic box that holds the 16-yard pass play to Victor Cruz that they always seem to pull out here. They keep it safe in a red velvet sleeve just for occasions like this. Good thing for Giants, too, because 49ers fell on it. But Bradshaw’s progress had been stopped, so it’s the right call. Two-minute warning. Willis buries Manning. So Smith lets his big moment pass: incompletion, Gore for 3, sack.  He may come to regret that. Giants take over at the 26 with 3:04 left and two timeouts. Manning knows what to do here.  They punt it back with 4:15 left. It goes out at the San Francisco 35. Alex Smith, paging Alex Smith: your moment may have arrived. And they don’t get it. So David Akers comes on for a 20-yard chip shot. He bangs it through, tying the score at 17-17 with 5:39 left. If Saints-Niners was any guide, we’ve still got two or three lead changes left. Boy, the 49ers don’t like to think about field goals, do they? They want touchdowns.  The Saints made the same mistake the Giants are making — they assumed Harbaugh would be practical and just tie the score and continue the fight. But Harbaugh wants to win. … and he almost made them pay. Smith just missed Delanie Walker going long down the left side, but a penalty on the Giants gives them a first down anyway. Then Smith takes off out of the shotgun when the pocket evaporates and races 17 yards to the 32. Now under eight minutes left. He grabs the kickoff after Manningham’s touchdown and races to the 45 — great starting position for Smith and the offense. Bad mistake? Might have blown the game? Not me. And who cares anyway?  A closer like Mariano Rivera or Brian Wilson couldn’t have brushed off a mistake faster than that. A couple runs and a couple throws move the Giants marginally closer and then Manning throws deep middle for Manningham — TOUCHDOWN! A 17-yard score gives the Giants the lead back, at 17-14, with 8:34 left. And if you’ve watched any Giants football this season, that should not have surprised you in the least.  The only surprise was that Cruz didn’t catch it. They get it at the 29, where they touched it, since they can’t advance it.  But this could be a huge moment in this game. If Giants score, and win, they’ll have to give a game ball to the inventor of the super slo-mo cam. Scoring, though, could be difficult the way the San Francisco defense has awakened. Devin Thomas gets credit for getting down there and being alert enough to grab the ball and make a stink about it. @FO_MTanier Michael Tanier Kyle Williams must be numb in that knee. Mon Jan 23 2:27:04  via Michael Tanier The game goes to commercial with a dispute about whether the ball hit the 49ers punt returner, Kyle Williams, or merely bounced free and was picked up (or I should say downed) by the Giants.  Ruling on the field is no touch, and 49ers ball. With about 11 minutes left, that call (or its reversal) deep in 49ers territory could be a massive call. Fox’s Mike Pereirra seems to think it hit him. Maybe it’s the red jerseys. Just seems like they are everywhere.  Backpedaling near his goal line, Manning whipped that last pass out like he couldn’t wait to get to the sideline and regroup. Oy. Consecutive commenters accuse me of 1. being a 49ers fan and 2. of East Coast bias.  At least my mom still loves me. (But then, she’s a Patriots fan, so she has nothing to complain about today.) @timkawakami Tim Kawakami Alex Smith has more rushes (5) than completed passes (3). And could easily win this game with 2 or 3 key completions here. Mon Jan 23 1:44:35  via Tim Kawakami
 Chris Canty helps him out on the final play of the third quarter by drawing a 15-yard penalty. Heading to the fourth: 49ers 14, Giants 10. San Francisco ball. Brown, who hit Dashon Goldson like a tidal wave, stays down. But now he’s walking off with help. That hit was so bad Harbaugh came out to check on him. Good to see him up. (Trainers were chuckling with Harbaugh, so it does not appear to be serious.) But the hit did its job; the Giants punt it away. They are shoving the Giants’ offensive line around up front, and flying around in the secondary. Manning just threw a midrange ball into coverage and FOUR GUYS had a chance to intercept it. One of them would have, too, if Tarell Brown hadn’t slammed into a teammate in midair. That looked like a car crash. The touchdown seems to have revived the 49ers, who sack Manning on third down to force a punt. The Giants really could have used a longer drive there, just to settle things down. Now they’ll really need to stand up and make sure they don’t let the 49ers drive down and open up some breathing room. @CowherCBS Bill Cowher Surprised I haven’t seen more screens. It slows down a pass rush. Mon Jan 23 1:41:07  via Bill Cowher Vernon Davis comes in motion right to left and takes off — getting behind Kenny Phillips — where Smith finds him. He leaps for a perfectly lofted ball at the goal line and hauls it in — TOUCHDOWN!! His second of the day, and just like that — good return, quick screen, deep ball — the 49ers are back in the lead at 14-10 with 5:18 left in the third quarter. UPDATED: On replay, Phillips clearly thought he was getting safety coverage, which is why he let Davis go. Unfortunately, the safety didn’t know that. He appeared, open, in the flat, and even Smith couldn’t miss that today. He rambles 24 yards. Kyle Williams, who is handling the returns in place of the injured Ted Ginn, had a seam and a head of steam. What he needed was a better set of cleats; one cut and he was down, but he still gives the 49ers the ball at their 46 with just under seven minutes left in the third quarter. In a 3-point game where his offense needs all the help it can get, that counts as a big play. They are playing — on both sides of the ball — like they’ve been in this spot before. Which many of them have. In fact, they essentially been playing playoff games since they faced the Jets at Christmas. The 49ers haven’t, and it looks it. The United States women’s national team, which is competing in the Concacaf Olympic qualifying tournament in Vancouver, is up 6-0 at halftime of its game against Guatemala. They won 14-0 in their opener. The 49ers are just hoping to get to 14 at this point. Manning completed passes to seven receivers in the first half, and finished it 16 of 27 for 181 yards. Alex Smith, meanwhile, was only 2 of 7 for 79 yards. But one of them was the 73-yard touchdown to Davis. So their passing game was, well, disappointing. Frank Gore had 46 yards on nine carries, so they didn’t run it much better. Part of the problem was that they barely had the ball. Still: Giants 10, 49ers 7. For those complaining that I don’t have the score in every update, it’s still 10-7 Giants. @SamBorden Sam Borden Cruz goes 8 for 125 in the first half. I’m no expert, but that seems good. Mon Jan 23 1:09:35  via Sam Borden Tynes hits from 31 yards with 2 seconds left in the half. Clock running, but Manning spikes it to run the field goal unit on. For second play in a row, the Giants seemed to forget they are out of timeouts. Manning tried to take one and got a delay penalty a second ago. Then he saves Tynes’s bacon, because he had run out to try the field goal on the final play without realizing the clock hadn’t stopped. But Manning saw him and his holder turning to sprint back, and stalled the snap (and spike) til they were safely back on the sideline. Manning steps up and find Cruz again (do the 49ers not watch tape?) and the Giants are at the 22 now. There are 20 seconds left, so they can try a couple passes before a kick. Manning hits Cruz for 15 yards, just on the other side of the 50. But the Giants have to use their last timeout to stop the clock. Manning them tries Manningham before going back to his security blanket, Cruz, for 11. With the ball deep in their end, the 49ers seemed to be trying to figure out a way to get to halftime without giving the ball back to the Giants. But they couldn’t do it. So Andy Lee punts it back with 1:36 left. The Giants get it about the 35. Much discussion so far. Sam Borden was concerned. @SamBorden Sam Borden It’s pretty dark out there — I am guessing it’s something wrong with the lights. Would have to think they should be on by now. Mon Jan 23 0:21:30  via Sam Borden So he and Judy Battista looked into it: @judybattista Judy Battista Am told no issue with the lights here. Mon Jan 23 0:47:27  via Judy Battista @SamBorden Sam Borden Told that apparently the lights are configured for baseball, so not all of them turn on for football. Mon Jan 23 0:47:40  via Sam Borden Which was a totally plausible explanation, except for … @PostBroncos Lindsay Jones @SamBorden They realize they have a whole different stadium for baseball in this city, right? Mon Jan 23 0:48:42  via Lindsay Jones So the mystery remains. @FO_MTanier Michael Tanier Since halftime of Falcons game, Eli Manning is 13-of-14 when passing on third and six or more, plus the fumble earlier Mon Jan 23 0:46:46  via Michael Tanier No groin pulls on that last pass to Cruz. He got one for the celebration after his touchdown, and just got a second for jumping into a shoving match between Michael Boley and several other 49ers.   @JSablichNYT Justin Sablich One of the ugliest extra points I’ve seen in awhile, weather is real nasty. Wonder how Kevin Boothe is going to hold up at center #giants Mon Jan 23 0:34:39  via Justin Sablich Manning buys time on second down, then flips the ball forward to a wide-open Bear Pascoe. A 6-yard TOUCHDOWN! Tie game. Manning loses his center (Baas) but keeps on going: to Cruz for Nicks (and another third-down conversion) and to Nicks for 9. Jacobs rushed 2 yards to the 6, and it’s first-and-goal. The first play of the second quarter is a doozy — Manning 36 yards to Victor Cruz, who got behind Carlos Rogers. A better ball and he would have followed the footprints left by Davis down that same sideline. Instead, he slows up for the ball and is hauled down at the 49ers 35. Nicks is back on the Giants’ sideline, but Vernon Davis is showing 49ers trainers his lower back. The teams have switched ends after the first quarter. Giants say they want the “dry” end this quarter. @SamBorden Sam Borden There is probably a more eloquent way to say this but: It is freaking POURING here. Mon Jan 23 0:18:05  via Sam Borden The 49ers call a reverse on first down (guess we’re done with the conservative play-calling) and Kendall Hunter loses the ball right in front of Umenyiora, but he can’t get the handle on it before the 49ers cover it. @judybattista Judy Battista Certainly Jim Harbaugh knows more about play-calling than most of us, but that call in this weather? Mon Jan 23 0:17:38  via Judy Battista The Giants, at that netherworld that is the opposing 34, go for it on fourth down. But Jacobs is stopped for no gain as he dives up the middle, and the ball goes back to the 49ers. Tough to kill Coughlin there; no way they were kicking a 50-yard field goal into the wind and rain on this field. Feel free to kill Jacobs, however, who ought to be able to get a yard just by leaning forward at his size. The Giants get to midfield on a catch by Nicks, but he gets up with his right shoulder hanging and runs straight to the sideline. Now he’s gone to the locker room. @judybattista Judy Battista Pouring and the wind is blowing hard in the Giants’ faces now. Mon Jan 23 0:10:35  via Judy Battista A very precise explanation by Ed Hochuli, but here’s the short version: he didn’t see enough to overturn the call on the field, so it’s a touchdown. So San Francisco leads, 7-0. @SamBorden Sam Borden Eddie Guns with a personal essay, the upside of which is that the TD stands. Mon Jan 23 0:04:26  via Sam Borden
 Just like last week’s fumble controversies in Green Bay, you probably haven’t heard the last of that decision. The plays under review, and a quick Fox replay makes it look as if Davis stepped on the sideline as he ran away from Rolle. This could be the Giants second HUUUUUUUGGGE break in four plays. Brutal mistake in the Giants secondary as Vernon Davis just sprint past Antrel Rolle down the right sideline. He sprints 73 yards — untouched and untroubled — to the end zone. TOUCHDOWN! Good news Giants fans. Jason Pierre-Paul bounced out of bed this morning fired up. Ready to go. You could almost picture him stalking around his hotel room screaming, “Wooooo! Letsgoletsgoletsgo!!” @DatBoyJPP Jason Pierre-Paul 8hrs And 60min to the big one Sun Jan 22 11:08:30  via Jason Pierre-Paul
 Let’s put aside for a moment that “8hrs And 60min” is actually, uh, nine hours. The bigger problem is that Pierre-Paul apparently forgot to reset his watch when he got to San Francisco on Saturday. Fortunately for him, Twitter has a built-in corrections department, otherwise known as the rest of Twitter. @DCFanaticsBlog DCFanatic @DatBoyJPP You have 12 hours until you game starts bro. Sun Jan 22 11:18:15  via DCFanatic
 Pierre-Paul, to his credit, quickly acknowledged his mistake. He thought the Giants had Sunday’s first game. @DatBoyJPP Jason Pierre-Paul @DCFanaticsBlog you right thought it was at 12pm Sun Jan 22 11:25:39  via Jason Pierre-Paul
 It was his last pregame post. Good thing Tom Coughlin’s not on Twitter.  Giants dodge a huge bullet as McDonald runs down Manning from behind on third down and strips the ball. It bounces free, and a 49er dives on it, but it squirts out and Kareem McKenzie at the 30. The Giants lose 13 yards, but avoid an early disaster. Instead, they are thrilled to punt it away. Manning now 2 for 2 on third-down conversions, finding Hakeem Nicks on the right sideline on third-and-8. When they run, though, they get nowhere. The 49ers linebackers are just so good. Manning goes deep over the middle with one of his first throws, then find Victor Cruz for 12 yards and a first down. It’s a good one, so Giants will start at the 16 after a short return. A handoff to Frank Gore and a short pass to him out of the backfield from Alex Smith, then a run by Kendall Hunter. Both coordinators said they would call the game differently because of the conditions, but the sloppy track is expected to be more of a problem for the Giants, who have feasted on big plays this season. San Francisco will get first crack with the wet ball.  It’s got to be a factor, no? But how? And when? That’ll be the question. Not as bad as Steven Tyler in Foxboro earlier today, but man: does anyone just sing the song anymore? Quick tip: the anthem’s not about you. It’s about all of us. (To be fair, Chenoweth didn’t butcher it the way some do.) The Fox analyst Jimmy Johnson just said the N.F.C. game “will be decided by the team that tackles the best.” Groundbreaking. Though I still think it will be decided in the traditional way, by the team that scores the most points. That’s like Tom Brady analysis. Brady just told the crowd in Foxborough that “I pretty much sucked today.” If it rains hard in San Francisco, I hope they have one of those A.F.C. Champions t-shirts Vince Wilfork is wearing in Foxborough to stretch over the stadium. That’d keep the players, the field and the fans dry. Because Cundiff just missed a last-second field goal that would have tied the A.F.C. title game.  A 32-yarder.  “Uh, sorry Ray. My bad. No hard feelings?” The Patriots are back in the Super Bowl. Only question now is who will join them. In what is a positive, though not unexpected development, for the Giants, Ted Ginn Jr. will not play today for the 49ers. Ginn is more dangerous in his role as a returner than as a receiver, but he hurt his knee against the Saints last week and was unable to recover. Tight end Delanie Walker will play, however, and might see a few more balls if the Giants blanket Vernon Davis. Walker is returning from a broken jaw sustained on Christmas Eve. But even though that was a month ago, the idea of getting hit by a linebacker with even the remains of that injury just sounds painful. Linebacker Mark Herzlich (ankle) is the only Giants casualty. Tight end Jake Ballard (knee), who has been in and out, will play. Can the N.F.L. still hold a playoff game without Twitter in this day and age? If a touchdown is scored and no one is there to Tweet it, does it still count for 6 points? Bill Pennington wrote about Giants Coach Tom Coughlin in Sunday’s Times, an in-depth (and, let’s be frank, a little frightening) look at the exacting methods and attention to detail that have helped the coach be successful. Mike Perkins was one of the first people Tom Coughlin hired as he built an N.F.L. franchise in Jacksonville during the mid-1990s. When the Jaguarsâ stadium was nearly complete, Coughlin ordered Perkins, the son of the former Giants coach Ray Perkins, onto the new field to calculate how many steps there were from the home sideline to the locker room.  âHe wanted to know exactly how long it would take to get into the locker room at halftime,â said Perkins, who assumed a multitude of football duties in his first year at Jacksonville. âWe did time trials â 19 seconds, 20 seconds. I thought he was nuts.â Next, Perkins was helping design the office rooms where coaches would watch game videos. Coughlin was worried about how far the seats would be from the video screen. âHe had me call other teams in the league and ask them how far their screens were from their chairs,â Perkins said. âPeople thought I was nuts.
