A closer look at Week 15, with the benefit of film review: Eagles O vs. Jets D The Jets’ game plan was seemingly to keep Michael Vick in the pocket and force him to be a progression passer. Realizing that Vick would have plenty of time against a soft four-man rush, Andy Reid and Marty Mornhinweg centered their aerial attack on slow-developing crossing patterns, which are extremely tough for a secondary to hold coverage against. Vick did a great job of patiently hanging in the pocket and waiting for his receivers to creep open. He threw with good timing, touch and accuracy. A few chunky gains from these plays were all it took for Philly to build and sustain a big lead. The Jets’ pass rush was not a factor over all, even when they were trying to attack. Phillyâs run game was also not much of a factor (no surprise â the Jetsâ physical front seven is too strong for Phillyâs finesse line and backs). The raw speed of Vick, Jeremy Maclin and DeSean Jackson generated a few big plays but nothing back-breaking. Most of the damage was done by tight end Brent Celek. One final note: in situations where it was plausible that New York would blitz, Philadelphia receivers spread extremely wide. This was a great tactic against a defense that often incorporates defensive backs in its blitzes. Spreading out made it easier for Vick and Company to identify which blitzers were coming, and it created more initial spacing in the passing game, which was critical given that the ball had to come out quickly. Jets O vs. Eagles D As was the case on the other side of the ball, the Eagles’ coaching staff thoroughly outwitted and outschemed the Jetsâ staff. They knew just what would make Mark Sanchez uncomfortable. The Eagles took away the Jetsâ staple of quick-developing, one-read throws by playing press coverage and/or running their swift linebackers to the hot spots near the numbers (where the majority of crossing patterns, quick slants, screens and rollouts go). They bewildered Sanchez with inside stunts on blitzes and consistently got penetration even with four-man rushes. Jason Babin absolutely owned this game, and not just because he often matched up against right tackle Wayne Hunter (who is a major liability in pass protection). The lopsided score took the Jets out of their run game. Thatâs too bad â their ground game would have been too powerful for Phillyâs finesse front seven. Redskins O vs. Giants D The Redskins took advantage of (or at least didnât squander) favorable field position in the first half. They stayed committed to their ground game, which, thanks to Giants end Jason Pierre-Paul, was only stellar, not spectacular. Pierre-Paul and Justin Tuck compensated for New Yorkâs mediocrity at linebacker. It was a little surprising that the Giants’ safeties were not a factor against the run â itâs not as if the Redskins have a feared group of receivers. Those receivers did, however, get the better of the Giants’ cornerbacks. Aaron Ross was beaten in Cover 3 a few times, and Prince Amukumara was destroyed in man-to-man on third down (he was benched late in the second quarter). Rex Grossman was adept at hanging in the pocket and locating the open target in obvious passing situations. One side note: the first interception was not on Grossman. True, Santana Moss had a step on Amukumara and the deep ball was underthrown. But that ball still sailed 55 yards. The problem was that the flea-flicker preceding the throw took too long. By the time Grossman got the ball back and could set and release, Moss was running out of his range. Giants O vs. Redskins D The Giants never found their rhythm through the air. Thatâs a problem considering their rhythm on the ground has not existed this season. Dropped passes stymied a few early drives. Eli Manning paid a heavy price for a few poor decisions, though all three of his interceptions included displays of terrific ball skills from Redskin defenders. The Redskins double-teamed receivers outside early on; corners Josh Wilson and DeAngelo Hall were excellent in underneath trail coverage. This forced Manning to work to his ancillary options inside. Over all, the pass protection was decent for the Giants, but the passing game execution simply was not. Washington controlled the tempo and flow. Chiefs O vs. Packers D The Chiefs’ offense was committed to milking the clock from the outset. They ran often on first and second down and, with a few exceptions in the second half, their passing game consisted of dink-and-dunk tactics such as play-action rollouts to tight ends and fullbacks, screens of all varieties and flares to the flats. It worked. Their third downs were manageable and the ground game was methodical. This approach kept the Packers in their base 3-4, where theyâre far more vanilla and reactive. With few exotic blitzes to worry about, Kyle Orton managed the game superbly. His first 23 completions were distributed amongst 10 different receivers. The Chiefs got great supporting performances from tight ends Anthony Becht and Leonard Pope and fullback LeâRon McClain. All three capitalized on their ball-handling opportunities and executed their run-blocks with precision. Packers fans need not worry too much about their D. It wore down a bit late in the game, but most defenses would in this sort of contest. The Packers were solid against the run and at least average against the pass. They just got lulled into a methodical contest on the road. Packers O vs. Chiefs D The Chiefs did nothing special â they simply lined up and played better football than their opponent. They used press man coverage across the board and often rushed only three, allowing for maximum safety help over the top. If Greg Jennings had been healthy, Green Bay may have had too many weapons to defend. But against Jordy Nelson, Donald Driver, Randall Cobb and James Jones, the physical presses consistently took away Aaron Rodgersâs quick reads, which took away his timing and rhythm. Rodgers had his worst game of the season. He played fast at times, overreacting to pass-rush pressure and hurriedly throwing off balance. Because of the three-man rush, he could stay in the pocket all day. That sounds ideal, but in this case, it eliminated his scrambling, which lifted a huge mental burden off the linebackers and removed the improvisational plays outside the pocket. The Packers’ pass protection wore down as the game progressed, which was just another reward for the Chiefsâ out-executing their opponent. Lions O vs. Raiders D In Mondayâs Quick Hits, it was written that Calvin Johnsonâs dominance can be expected when he faces man-to-man coverage for four quarters. It also said if the Raiders had played zone, they might have held Johnson to under 125 yards but Matthew Stafford would have still topped 390, with the yards just being distributed more evenly to others. Then, weâd be criticizing the man-heavy Raiders for playing a style in which theyâre not comfortable. After reviewing the film, thatâs actually where the criticism needed to be. The Raiders played tight man in short-yardage and third down situations (which the Lions took advantage of with pick routes and crossing patterns), but in their dime packages, they spent a lot of time in man-zone concepts, defending Johnson with loose man coverage and safety help. They had to rely on unqualified safeties for this due to having utility defender Michael Huff and several top cornerbacks out of the lineup. A few times the Raiders went to Tampa 2, which is foreign to them. The Lions generated big plays with Calvin Johnson running routes that attacked the safetiesâ zones over the top, often with presnap motion (something they donât do often). Those were the difference in the game. Over all, the Raider defense was solid, yielding just 14 points through the first 53 minutes. But in crunch time, they didnât have the pass rush or secondary depth to hold on. Credit Matthew Stafford and the Lion coaching staff for consistently identifying and anticipating Oaklandâs coverage concepts. Raiders O vs. Lions D The Raiders played a sound, steady game. In fact, it was surprising that they only scored 20 offensively. They were able to run the ball late, but over all, a lot of their traditional run plays were substituted for screens and reverses. They did this (successfully) because the way to attack the Lionsâ speedy front seven is to widen the field and get them flowing in the wrong direction. Carson Palmer was very sharp in his progressions. He was able to trust his pass protection, which had been struggling in recent weeks but settled down against a Lions D that refused to blitz. When you donât blitz, the offensive linemen have very little to think about. Thatâs how a struggling offensive line can quickly regain its form. Darrius Heyward-Bey took advantage of the Â soft off-coverage cornerbacks. (That was a questionable defensive approach; the best way to defend the still-raw Heyward-Bey is to press him. True, he may run by you, but more likely heâll struggle to get off the jam and then run an unrefined route). Heyward-Bey was having a great game until a costly second-half fumble in scoring position. Saints O vs. Vikings D Thereâs not a lot to say here. Drew Breesâs passing numbers told the story. If anything, they undersold this offensive assault. Brees underthrew Robert Meachem on two deep balls and, on several plays, he had the freedom to choose between multiple wide open receivers. There was simply nothing challenging about the Viking defense. You could blame the array of secondary injuries, but Minnesotaâs still-healthy pass rush was irrelevant, and the second-level defenders were merely mediocre against the run. One interesting tactic the Saints used: They had their outside receivers run their vertical routes uncommonly close to the sidelines. This stretched the back end of the Vikingsâ zones, creating more space for safeties Mistral Raymond and Jamarca Sanford to defend (or, more accurately, for the Saints to exploit). Vikings O vs. Saints D You simply canât play in todayâs N.F.L. without at least a modestly dynamic passing game (unless you have an option quarterback with fullback size and heart/grit/guts/five-star leadership skills, etc.). The Vikings did not even bother trying to go downfield with their wide receivers. Instead, they relied on gimmicks and cheap gadgets that the Saints easily sniffed out. The worst was putting Joe Webb at quarterback and Christian Ponder at running back in a full house backfield formation. The idea was to create option reads, but with Webb as the point man, the defense knew where the ball would go because there was no way the Vikings would actually toss or hand off to Ponder. The Saints could simply assume that the ball would go in the opposite direction of Ponder. They were right (and it didnât matter whether Webb ran or threw). In all seriousness, it would have been more effective for the Vikings to take Ponder off the field and play 10 on 11. That way the defense at least wouldnât be able to ignore an entire side of the formation. Talk about bad offensive design.
