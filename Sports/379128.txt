Advertisement  The World Boxing Council said yesterday it would not sanction the Nov. 23 fight between the champion, EVANDER HOLYFIELD, and FRANCESCO DAMIANI as a heavyweight title bout. Holyfield signed to box Damiani at Atlanta when his scheduled Nov. 8 fight with MIKE TYSON was postponed because of Tyson's rib injury. "The W.B.C. will only sanction a heavyweight championship fight if the champion makes his mandatory defense against the No. 1 of the world and the official challenger," the W.B.C. said. Tyson is ranked No. 1 by the W.B.C. Damiani is unranked by all three sanctioning bodies. "We expected this," said KATHY DUVA, a spokesman for Main Events, who noted that Holyfield "will still be putting the I.B.F. and W.B.A. belts on the line."
