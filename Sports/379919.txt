Advertisement  Quarterback RICK MIRER announced yesterday that he would return to Notre Dame for his senior season. Mirer, who had been considering giving up his final year of eligibility to enter the National Football League draft, said there were "a lot of things" that went into his decision. "Most importantly, I just wanted to be happy, and I think I could be happy here another year," Mirer said. "I've got another shot at helping us try to win a national championship, and that's something I've thought about since I was being recruited back in 1988 when Notre Dame won it all," he said. Mirer led Notre Dame to a 9-3 record in 1991 and a Sugar Bowl victory over Florida.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
