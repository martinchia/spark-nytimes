Advertisement  Kleinman has said that he advised against giving the money to Spira, who is from the Bronx. However, he became involved in the disposition of the payment last January and arranged to have a money-market account opened in Spira's name at a Bronx branch of Chase Manhattan Bank. Spira could not open an account himself because he had no acceptable form of identification. Spira, who had given Steinbrenner information about the outfielder Dave Winfield, who was then with the Yankees, and Winfield's charitable foundation, received the $40,000 in two checks and deposited a check for $30,500 in the new account. The bank, a man close to Spira said, closed the account last week, saying it was doing so ''at the bank's discretion.'' Joseph Morelli, an official at the branch bank, declined yesterday to comment about the bank's action, as did Ken Mills, Chase Manhattan's vice president for public relations.
