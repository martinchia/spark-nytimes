BETHESDA, Md. — For Davis Love III, meeting the president does not come once in a lifetime; it comes with each new administration. Love said that he had met every president since Gerald Ford. On Wednesday, he added President Obama to that list. At the presidentâs invitation, Love joined two other American golfers â Phil Mickelson and Bubba Watson â at the White House for a roughly 20-minute meet and greet with Obama. The meeting was arranged with the help of the P.G.A. Tour of America, which organizes events like the P.G.A. Championship and the Ryder Cup. Golfers playing at Congressional Country Club this week are not likely to enjoy any more face time with Obama, though the White House is about a 30-minute drive from Congressional. He is not expected to attend the Open. The last president to do so was Bill Clinton in 1997, when a special viewing platform was built for him near the 16th hole. Love said he did not mind that Obama was not coming to the Open. âIt is always exciting to meet the president,â Love, the Ryder Cup captain, said. âHe was very friendly and genuine and down to earth. We hope heâll come to the Ryder Cup to support us in his hometown.â The Ryder Cup, which will be held on Sept. 25-30, 2012, in the Chicago suburb of Medinah, Ill., and having Obama there might give the United States team the motivation it needs to take back the Cup. The Americans won the Ryder Cup in 2008, but the Europe team has won four of the last five tournaments. American golfers could also use the encouragement at majors. The last American to win a major was Mickelson, at the 2010 Masters.
