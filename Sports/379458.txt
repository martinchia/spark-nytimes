A lot of people have shared their opinions about how well Plaxico Burress will do (or won’t do) in his first season since being released from jail. Burress spoke with his play in his preseason debut on Sunday night with the Jets, with a catch on the team’s opening offensive play and a diving touchdown catch before halftime. The message to the rest of the league seemed to be: Don’t dare cover me one-one-one. Oh, and I’m back. Later, he spoke with reporters. The full transcript of his remarks and those of Rex Ryan and Mark Sanchez can be found on Jets.com. Here are a few excerpts. PLAXICO BURRESS On how he feels about his performanceâ¦
It just feels good to get back into the flow, to get into the game and get live competition. To get hit, catch the ball, just get the gist of it again.
On if he was nervousâ¦
Not nervous at all. Just more nervous excitement. I was just anxious to get out there. I felt like I was moving in slow-motion a little bit. I was in the place where I was supposed to be at the end of the play, but thereâs still some work to do.
  On if he thinks heâll catch it every time Mark Sanchez throws the ball up, similar to his touchdown catch tonightâ¦
Thatâs the plan. When teams come out and run cover zero, an all-out blitz with no safety help, those are the plays you have to make on that coverage. Itâs one of the most disrespectful coverages in football. When you can go out and make big plays against that coverage, it stops teams from doing it.
On if he feels disrespected when heâs being covered by only one defenderâ¦
Itâs cover zero. You just have one guy to beat. You know the ballâs coming out pretty quick. You just try to get your guy and get up to the football.
On if this was the first night it sunk in that heâs a New York Jetâ¦
Yeah. To be honest, yes. Just to walk into the stadium, to get on the football field. Doing stretching and different things like that, I kind of felt like I was there, but in my mind I couldnât believe that I was actually throwing the football again. It was an out-of-body experience, a surreal feeling. I just try to stay focused on the little details they ask me to do. I just try to go out there and make a few plays. REX RYAN On Plaxico Burress in his first game action as a Jetâ¦
Really, he was outstanding. Really during the weeks [of training camp], you guys have been out there, we all see it. The DBs are like, “Wow, this guy is something.” A great route runner and obviously he has that mismatch every time he goes up. You see we beat Cover One and we beat Cover Zero throwing the ball up to him. I donât care who you are playing corner, you can be Willie Brown or Darrelle Revis out there, thatâs going to be tough. MARK SANCHEZ  On what he was thinking as the play developedâ¦
Just, I hope he catches it. It was a heck of an adjustment for him. I threw that ball pretty high, and for him to come down with it, to have the body control to know where he was at, right in the front corner of the end zone, thatâs a big-time veteran catch, so thatâs nice.
On being able to throw the ball up to Burress even when he is coveredâ¦
Heâs expressed that to me. The same thing with Santonio, itâs a different kind of receiver, but with a big body like that itâs tough to cover him even when he is covered. So you can count on him making plays. On if there was an adjustment during the touchdown to Burressâ¦
It was an adjustment on his route, and he knew exactly what was coming with the pressure. Heâs picked up the offense fast to make that adjustment. It takes younger guys a longer time to do that, but heâs been doing this so long, he knew exactly where to go. We couldnât handle everything up front and we needed to get the ball out, so he was right. Extra point: If you had any doubts on Burress, have they been assuaged?
