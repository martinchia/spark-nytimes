Advertisement  The 16-driver lineup is almost set for the first running of the Hawaiian Super Gran Prix, a 100-mile race with a $1 million first prize that is scheduled for Jan. 24 in Honolulu. The organizers announced yesterday that they have received acceptances from the Indy-car drivers MARIO ANDRETTI, AL UNSER JR. and Japan's HIRO MATSUSHITA ; the Formula One drivers MARTIN BRUNDLE of England, ERIK COMAS of France and MICHAEL SCHUMACHER of Germany; the stock-car racers KYLE PETTY and BILL ELLIOTT ; the sports-car drivers DEREK WARWICK of England and JUAN MANUEL FANGIO 2d of Argentina and a sprint-car star, STEVE KINSER. In addition, MICHAEL ANDRETTI and the Italian Formula One driver RICCARDO PATRESE are likely to take part. All drivers are guaranteed $35,000 for starting the race, and they will drive identical Shelby Can-Am sports cars that are expected to reach about 140 miles an hour on the 1.5-mile, 12-turn course surrounding Aloha Stadium. The race will be telecast on a pay-per-view basis in the United States, the organizers said, with details still to be worked out. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
