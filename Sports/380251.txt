 Tom Jelte Slagter of the Netherlands won the seventh stage of the Paris-Nice race on Saturday, while the Colombian rider Carlos Betancur retained the overall lead heading into the last day. Slagter clinched his second stage win of the race by beating the world champion Rui Costa of Portugal in a sprint to the line, with Betancur finishing in third place. All three were clocked at 5 hours 5 seconds over the 195.5-kilometer (121-mile) trek from Mougins to Biot Sophia Antipolis in the heart of the French Riviera, which featured two tough Category 1 climbs and three moderate ascents. Betancur looks set to win the race, since he leads Costa by 14 seconds and is 26 ahead of the Czech rider Zdenek Stybar.
