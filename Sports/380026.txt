Advertisement Supported by By The Associated Press LISBON, Portugal — Atlético Madrid forwards Diego Costa and Arda Turan trained normally on Friday, boosting their chances of being able to play against Real Madrid in the Champions League final on Saturday. Costa, who injured his right thigh muscle in Atlético’s Spanish-title-clinching win at Barcelona last Saturday, had sought treatment in Belgrade, Serbia, this week from a doctor specializing in using fluid derived from horse placentas to repair damaged cells. Costa favored his right leg at times on Friday but trained with the rest of the team and took part in all exercises.  Turan left Saturday’s 1-1 tie at Barcelona with a hip problem, but he also trained normally on Friday. “We’ll evaluate both of them in training today. It all depends on how they feel in the training,” Atlético Coach Diego Simeone said. “We’ll talk about it tonight and see what the team needs; then we’ll see.” In the other camp, Cristiano Ronaldo seems certain to be fit to lead Real Madrid’s attack in the final. Ronaldo missed Madrid’s league match last weekend to rest an injured leg.  Real Coach Carlo Ancelotti said that Ronaldo “doesn’t have any problems” but acknowledged that he had lingering doubts about Ronaldo’s strike partner, Karim Benzema, and defender Pepe. Benzema (hamstring) and Pepe (calf) have not trained this week. Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
