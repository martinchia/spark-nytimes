Advertisement Supported by By The New York Times What to watch for in Saturday’s World Cup quarterfinals: Argentina vs. Belgium, noon: This game pits two teams who played eerily similar games in the Round of 16. Both dominated play and should have scored multiple goals, but both failed at finishing until extra time. It was not until the 118th minute when Argentina connected on a masterful pass from Lionel Messi to Ángel Di María to beat Switzerland. Belgium got extra-time goals from Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku, but had all its other chances squelched by United States goalkeeper Tim Howard. Both teams rely on ball possession and timely quick strikes, which portends a highly skilled, competitive game. Argentina does have one of the world’s best players in Messi, but has nothing like the Belgian defender Vincent Kompany. Netherlands vs. Costa Rica, 4 p.m.: On paper, this looks like a mismatch. Costa Rica is the spunky Central American underdog that could, the team that needed penalty kicks to get past a dour Greece team in the Round of 16. And the Netherlands is the big, bad bully from Europe that crushed Mexico’s hopes with a dose of big, bad, bullying soccer in the final minutes to advance to this quarterfinal. Costa Rica’s poster boy is the bouyant Bryan Ruiz, while the Netherlands follows the lead of Arjen Robben — now known for his theatrical skills in drawing fouls along with his soccer skill — and Robin van Persie. All times are Eastern. Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
