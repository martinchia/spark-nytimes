 On Sunday, Jorge Castillo of The Times wrote of Eli Manning: Last week, Manning, the Giantsâ captain, made a detour from his usual approach when he was asked during a radio interview whether he was a top-five quarterback alongside the likes of Tom Brady, considered to be one of the top quarterbacks in N.F.L. history. Manning could have gone two ways: settle on another safe response and skirt the question or provide a more pointed opinion. He chose the second. âYeah, I consider myself in that class, and Tom Brady is a great quarterback,â he said. It might have been a fun discussion topic — and it’s not wrong to stick up for yourself — but as always, it’s helpful to watch the tape.  In the comments section of a post by Mike Tanier, a reader sent in a YouTube video (above) of all of Manning’s 25 interceptions last season and wrote: “Nine interceptions were caused by tipped balls from his receivers.”  Take a look yourself. One conclusion: Hakeem Nicks can help out Manning an awful lot this season if he can refrain from  tipping balls into the hands of opponents and stick to his routes. Manning is already without two safety valves in Kevin Boss and Steve Smith, so the on-field harmony between Manning and Hicks will bear watching in 2011.  The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
