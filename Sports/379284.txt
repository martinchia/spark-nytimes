Advertisement By ROBIN FINN The United States Davis Cup Team, scheduled to begin defense of its 1990 championship in less than three weeks, does not yet exist, and Tom Gorman, the captain, has spent the last week scouring the field of the Newsweek Champions Cup for recruits. But little that has happened here has calmed his nerves. Those veterans who want to play Davis Cup cannot commit themselves, and those Gorman wants to enlist for singles duty will not commit themselves. Rick Leach and Jim Pugh, who won in Philadelphia two weeks ago but lost here in the opening round, are undefeated in Davis Cup competition (4-0) and will again be responsible for doubles. Nobody has claimed either of the two singles spots, but John McEnroe, the headliner on four winning American teams, made a point of announcing that nobody had bothered to ask him to compete.

But right now, Gorman, who has an uneasy relationship with McEnroe and has expressed preference for bringing along younger Davis Cup prospects, sees the selection process in a medical light. Pete Sampras, Brad Gilbert, Aaron Krickstein and Jay Berger, for example, are all on the injured list. Krickstein and Gilbert are wearing air casts; Berger is recovering from surgery that renders him unavailable for the next six months, and Sampras is hobbled by another leg injury that has the 19-year-old United States Open champion -- and his admirers -- fearing for his future.
