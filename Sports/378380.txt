Alex Rodriguezâs return to the Bronx has coincided with a nice run by the Yankees, who have won four of five games on their current homestand and gained ground in the American League wild-card race.  After Tuesdayâs games, in which the Yankees pounded the Los Angeles Angels (with Rodriguez getting a two-run double) and four  teams ahead of them in the wild-card race â Oakland, Tampa Bay, Baltimore and Kansas City â lost, the Yankees have pulled to within five and a half games of the Rays and the Aâs, the wild-card leaders.   With more than 40 games to go in the season, that is not a particularly daunting margin to overcome, and maybe the Yankees can do it. An injury-splattered season that was starting to become hopeless no longer looks that way. Every game now matters. Which means Yankees fans probably have no choice but to root for Rodriguez every time he has a  bat in his hands.  In his first game back in the Bronx, on Friday night, some fans booed him, and others cheered, and some in the latter group looked, on TV at least, as if they were smirking with defiance as they urged him on. But now, with the Yankees moving toward contention, what Yankees fan is going to hold his nose when Rodriguez comes to the plate? Is any Yankees fan going to root for him to hit into a double play with two runners on base and the score tied and the Rays and Aâs and Orioles all losing on the scoreboard?   Rodriguez is essentially out on bail these days, playing virtually every game while the appeal of his 211-game drug suspension goes through an arbitration procedure that will probably last the rest of the season. At the moment, of course, his guilt has not been determined, but there is a consensus that Major League Baseball has some evidence against him, particularly since the players union has acknowledged that it advised Rodriguez  to accept a modest suspension right now if one was in the offing. Yankees fans would not necessarily vote for a political candidate in trouble with the law, but what alternative do they now have, with the Yankees on a roll, but to cheer on Rodriguez? He is a player who has basically been accused by Major League Baseball of cheating through the use of performance-enhancers, but he is also batting cleanup for a team that is admirably trying to get into the playoffs for the 18th time in the last 19 seasons. The next four weeks will probably determine if  the Yankees can do it. They will play the Orioles 7 times in that period, the Rays 3 and the Red Sox 10. If they can beat up on Boston, the Yankees might even make a little run at the A.L. East crown, unthinkable as that may seem. So there you have it. Go, Alex.
