On the morning of Dec. 2, the Cleveland Cavaliers had a record of 7-10. While that record was nothing to brag about, at the time it was good for eighth place in the Eastern Conference, and Cleveland fans were cautiously optimistic about the teamâs prospects. The Cavaliers faced a stern test that evening, though, as LeBron James made his much-anticipated return to Cleveland..Playing in front of an electric crowd, the Cavaliers jumped to a 17-12 lead over the Miami Heat with 4 minutes 31 seconds remaining in the first quarter. Then the bottom fell out. The Heat scored the next 16 points and never looked back, cruising to a 118-90 win as James led the way with 38 points. That loss to the Heat was the second in what would eventually be a 10-game losing streak, and armchair psychologists everywhere blamed the prelude and aftermath of âThe Returnâ for Clevelandâs struggles. But even before the loss to the Heat, the Cavaliers were simply not a good team. In October and November, Cleveland lost seven games by 10 or more points, more than any team save the Timberwolves and Clippers.
 The Cavaliers also benefited from a manageable early-season schedule. Clevelandâs strength of schedule in October and November was about average, but in December and thus far in January the Cavaliers have played the second-toughest schedule in the N.B.A.
None of this, though, excuses Clevelandâs free-fallover the past two months.  After breaking their 10-game skid with an overtime win over the Knicks, the Cavaliers returned to their losing ways â they are currently in the midst of an 18-game tailspin. Clevelandâs abysmal season is historic on many levels. First, only 15 teams in N.B.A. history have had a longer losing streak. In fact, the Cavaliers franchise holds the all-time record of 24 straight losses. That record was spread out over two seasons, as Cleveland lost the last 19 games of the 1981-82 season and the first five games of the 1982-83 season. Second, last season the Cavaliers outscored their opponents by an average of 6.5 points per game. This season Cleveland is being outscored by an average of 11.3 points per game. If it holds, this swing of 17.8 points per game would represent the largest decline in point differential in league history. Finally, the Cavaliers are poised to set an N.B.A. record for the biggest drop in winning percentage from one season to the next. Last season, Cleveland led the league with a .744 winning percentage. Through Thursday, the Cavaliersâ winning percentage stood at .178, a precipitous decline of .566. For now, though, the record for the largest year-to-year decline in winning percentage belongs to the Chicago Bulls. The Bullsâ winning percentage plummeted from .756 in 1997-98 to .260 in 1998-99. That team lost not one star but two: Michael Jordan to retirement and Scottie Pippen to the Houston Rockets. While not even the most optimistic Cavalier fans felt the team would continue to challenge for Eastern Conference supremacy after the loss of James, few could have expected such a historic collapse. And given Clevelandâs opponents over the next three games â Denver, Orlando, and Miami â it does not appear that the suffering will end soon.
