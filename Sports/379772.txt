SAN ANTONIO -â Kansas has the easiest road to the Final Four of any top-seeded team in N.C.A.A. history, if the seeds are used to compare opponents.  The Jayhawks are No. 1 in the Southwest Region, which is the first-ever regional with three double-digit seeds among the four remaining teams.  Kansas opened the tournament by beating No. 16 Boston University and No. 9 Illinois. On Friday night at the Alamodome, Kansas faces No. 12 Richmond. The winner will play either No. 10 Florida State or No. 11 Virginia Commonwealth on Sunday for a berth in the Final Four.  Of course, the Jayhawks are dismissing any suggestion that their road is smoother than anyone elseâs. And they point out that last yearâs Kansas team was seeded first and lost to No. 9 Northern Iowa in the second round. âItâs not about the seeds,â Kansas Coach Bill Self said. âFans and media people may play it out to be that way. Itâs not about the seeds. Itâs about players. Itâs about matchups. And Richmond has good players. Everybody left has good players.â

His players, Self added, will think of Richmond âas incorrectly seeded.â If all this seems familiar for Kansas, it should. Its 2008 national championship team, seeded first, opened the tournament with victories over No. 16 Portland State and No. 8 U.N.L.V. At the regional, Kansas beat No. 12 Villanova, then No. 10 Davidson, which had upset third-seeded Wisconsin.  Kansas arrived at the Final Four having beaten no team higher than No. 8. Duplicating the trick this year would require victories over a No. 9 team â already done â and three double-digit seeds.  The 2008 team, led by Mario Chalmers and Brandon Rush, showed its strength at the Final Four by beating two other top-seeded teams: North Carolina, then Memphis in a final that went to overtime.  One more thing: That Final Four was played at the Alamodome in San Antonio.
