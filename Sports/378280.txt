Advertisement  The battle between auto industry giants, Ford and Chevrolet, is once again off to the races with the imminent return of Ford engines to the Indy-car circuit after an absence of 20 years. Cosworth Engineering and Ford Motor Company announced yesterday the formation of a new Indy-car team to provide engines for the 1992 season. Cars driven by the newly crowned series champion, MICHAEL ANDRETTI, and his father, MARIO, along with Chip Ganassi driver EDDIE CHEEVER, will be powered by the new engine. Meanwhile, the Chevrolet Motor Division and Ilmor Engineering Ltd. announced in Michigan that they would introduce a version of their Chevrolet V8 engine next year and also have a program to make it more affordable. Chevrolet engines have dominated Indy-car racing in recent years. Chevy and Ilmor announced a new, smaller compact engine that will be developed in conjunction with Penske Racing.
