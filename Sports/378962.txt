In March 2008, the Detroit Tigers signed a lumbering slugger to what was then the fifth-largest contract in baseball history. His physique and conditioning were suspect, prompting skeptics to warn that he would become a defensive liability and that his hitting might tail off. But Dave Dombrowski, the clubâs general manager, brushed aside such concerns and gave him an eight-year, $152 million deal. Dombrowski has had the last laugh. Halfway through that contract, all that the slugger, Miguel Cabrera, has done is win a batting title, a home run title and a runs-batted-in title; led the American League in combined on-base and slugging percentage over the past four years; and steered the Tigers to last yearâs A.L. Championship Series. He has a strong claim as the best hitter in baseball, and the remaining four years and $86 million left on his contract now look like a bargain. After such vindication, one can hardly blame Dombrowski for doubling down on his bet. Last Tuesday, he agreed to a nine-year, $214 million deal with perhaps the only player in the game who makes Cabrera look svelte: Prince Fielder, whose body mass index is the second-highest in baseball history, according to official height and weight figures. (The 322-pound Walter Young, who had a cup of coffee with Baltimore in 2005, edges out Fielder for the B.M.I. crown.) Will Detroit prove the naysayers wrong again? Two big differences separate the megadeals. The first is that Cabreraâs contract was just a better bet than Fielderâs. Cabrera was a month short of 25, so he still had time to develop as a hitter â which he has done, by improving his plate discipline. And the package covered him only through 32, when most top sluggers remain productive. By contrast, Fielder, who will turn 28 in May, is unlikely to improve. And he will be paid until he is 37, when his skills will surely have diminished.  The second key distinction is that the Tigers have Miguel Cabrera. With two natural first basemen on the roster, Manager Jim Leyland will have to put one of them at a suboptimal position. Which configuration would be the least inefficient? The simplest option would be keeping Cabrera at first and making Fielder the full-time designated hitter. Thereâs certainly a case for keeping the misleadingly named Fielder as far from fielding as possible. According to Defensive Runs Saved, a fielding statistic published on FanGraphs.com, Milwaukeeâs opponents scored an additional five runs a year from 2009 through 2011 because of Fielderâs poor play at first for the Brewers. But that would require Detroit to keep the punchless Brandon Inge as their everyday third baseman. If they were to replace Inge with a cheap free-agent D.H. like Raul Ibanez or Hideki Matsui, they would probably score 15 to 20 more runs. With that plan in mind, Cabrera has said he expects to return to third base, where he has not played in nearly four years. Cabrera insists that third is his natural position. But he was dismal there even in his youth with Florida. In terms of Defensive Runs Saved, his work at third cost the Marlinsâ pitchers an average of 12 runs a season. And a typical third basemanâs defense will deteriorate by about six runs a year from ages 24 to 29. Furthermore, Cabrera will be rusty at third base. He may need a few months to refamiliarize himself with the position. And opponents are likely to exploit his immobility by frequently bunting in his direction. All told, the Tigers would probably allow around 25 more runs with Cabrera at third and Fielder at first than they would with Inge at third and Cabrera at first. That loss would more than offset the offensive gain from benching Inge. Moreover, playing Cabrera at third would increase his risk of injury. Detroit had the right idea when it moved him to first. A third option, however, could make the best use of Cabreraâs skills. He does have one legitimate defensive tool: his arm. According to the Hardball Times Web site, during his last season as a full-time outfielder, 2005, he threw out 40 percent more runners than an average left fielder would have, given his opportunities. And when the ball was hit to him, runners tried to advance 9 percent less frequently than average â the best âintimidationâ ratio in baseball. At first base, Cabreraâs only defensive strength is squandered. If Cabrera can still throw the way he used to, the best spot for him could well be right field. He would surely let plenty of balls drop â perhaps 15 runsâ worth. But opposing hitters could not intentionally hit the ball his way, as they could if he were at third. Moreover, he could plausibly gain five runs back with his arm. If so, he would be just as valuable over all in right field as he is at first base. The thought of seeing Cabrera roaming Comerica Parkâs gaping power alleys may make Tigers fans shudder. But last year, St. Louis deposited Lance Berkman, a first baseman with gimpy knees who is seven years older than Cabrera, back in right after a six-year hiatus from full-time outfield duty. And despite Berkmanâs suspect defense, his bat helped propel the Cardinals to a World Series crown. The Tigersâ corner outfield situation is crowded: Delmon Young, Brennan Boesch and Ryan Raburn are all expected to see time. But if Cabrera can play right field, Detroit could look to peddle some of those spare parts in a trade for a better designated hitter or third baseman. The Tigers shocked the baseball world by signing Fielder. Now they just need a little creativity to accommodate their 275-pound prize.
