The Pirates, losing a chance to regain a first-place tie with the Mets in the National League East, lost their fourth game in a row and their fifth in six games. The Phillies, who have won the first three games of the four-game series, led by 3-1 in the fourth, but the Pirates tied the score on bases-empty homers by Bobby Bonilla and Andy Van Slyke. Bill Landrum (3-2), the Pirates reliever, retired Carmelo Martinez to start the ninth, but Charlie Hayes and Ricky Jordan singled, sending Hayes to third.
