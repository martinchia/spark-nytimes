A capsule look at the Giants’ 38-35 loss to Green Bay on Sunday: KEY PLAYER Travis Beckum began the season as the top tight end on the Giantsâ depth chart but was passed in training camp by Jake Ballard and had not had a reception since Week 3. He hooked up with Eli Manning on the gameâs first drive, however, recording a 67-yard catch-and-run for a touchdown. KEY NUMBER: 5 Thatâs how many consecutive challenges Coach Tom Coughlin has lost, including two Sunday. Usually one of the leagueâs best, he looked frustrated after officials overruled him in the first quarter and again in the third. He is 3 for 9 on challenges this season. TALKING POINT The Giants got a break when Dallas lost to Arizona. Was staying close to Green Bay enough of a moral victory to boost the Giants next week against the Cowboys?
