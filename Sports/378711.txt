DALLAS â Joe Girardi joined the Yankeesâ staff at the winter meetings Tuesday, and he did not sound any more optimistic than his general manager about obtaining a top-end starter to slot in behind C.C. Sabathia in the rotation. The general manager, Brian Cashman, has been engaged in talks about a potential trade and has inquired about several free agents, but he said, âItâs going to be hard to add to what we have currently.â Girardi noted that even if a deal was not struck at the winter meetings, one could develop later in the off-season. âI think thereâs a lot of groundwork that starts here,â he said.   In the meantime, Girardi was left to assess his current group of five starters, which could be the five he has on opening day. He said a lot depended on Phil Hughesâs regaining the form that enabled him to win 18 games in 2010. âWhen you look at our rotation this year, we need Phil Hughes to come back and be Phil Hughes,â Girardi said. âThatâs important.â Girardi also said that Hector Noesi, who went 2-2 with a 4.47 earned run average last season, mostly in relief, could get more than just the two starts he made. âI was really pleased with the progress he made last year,â Girardi said, âand he could be a factor as a starter for us this year.â As Cashman peruses the landscape for other pitching possibilities, Hiroki Kurodaâs name has resurfaced. The Yankees tried to get him from the Los Angeles Dodgers at the trade deadline July 31, but he invoked his no-trade clause and stayed in Los Angeles. The Red Sox also tried to acquire Kuroda at the trade deadline, and like the Yankees have some level of interest again. But as with other free agents like C.J. Wilson, Mark Buehrle and Edwin Jackson, the price could be too high for the Yankees. That has left Cashman to focus on trades. âI donât have significant money to be playing like that on the free-agent market,â Cashman said in general terms, not referring to a specific player. But in trade talks for pitchers like John Danks of the Chicago White Sox, Gio Gonzalez of the Oakland Athletics or Matt Garza of the Chicago Cubs, teams are asking for much in return, with packages that include more than one of their top prospects, including their best young pitchers and catcher Jesus Montero. âThere are things I could do,â he told reporters, âbut if I told you what it would take to do them, you would write tomorrow I shouldnât do them.â  The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
