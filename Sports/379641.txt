FOXBOROUGH, Mass. â The Jets defeated the Patriots, 28-21, on Sunday to advance to the American Football Conference championship game with a strong defensive effort and an opportunistic offense.  After a week of trash talk between the teams, the Jets backed up their bravado. Unlike their last time here, a 45-3 loss on Dec. 6, there was no embarrassing finish. The Jets will face the Steelers in Pittsburgh on Sunday.  With the Jetsâ defense slowing Tom Brady, the Jetsâ second-year quarterback, Mark Sanchez, overcame early accuracy issues to steer his team to the win. For a second straight week, Sanchez emerged the victor over one of the N.F.L.âs elite quarterback; the Jets defeated Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts last weekend. There was an intriguing off-field undercurrent for the game, despite the important stakes. Coach Rex Ryan and his players tossed verbal barbs at the Patriots last week. The Patriots largely did not respond to the boastful comments from their division rivals. 


7:46 P.M.Jets 28, Patriots 21


A last-gasp score for the Patriots, with Brady hitting Deion Branch with a 13-yard scoring pass with 21 seconds left. It was Brady’s 30th postseason touchdown, tying Terry Bradshaw for fifth all-time.




7:37 P.M.Jets 28, Patriots 14


This one is over. Greene sealed the game with a 16-yard touchdown run. Then he punctuated it by waving to the morose Patriots’ fans, putting the ball on the ground and resting his head on it as if it were a pillow. There is 1:41 on the clock, which does not seem to be not enough time for the Patriots to mount a come back.




7:33 P.M.Jets 21, Patriots 14


The Patriots made it a 21-14 game with a 35-yard field goal by Graham. But there was little celebration. The Patriots knew they probably needed to recover the ensuing onside kick when considering a comeback. Well, the Patriots did not recover the kick, and now they can only hope to stop the Jets to keep their season alive.




7:23 P.M.Patriots Last Chance


The Patriots have 3:29 to save their season. After the Jets punted away â Julian Edelman returned it 44 yards to the Jets’ 43 â the Patriots now have to score and probably recover an onside kick to have a shot at tying this game.




7:16 P.M.Where is Patriots’ Urgency?


With time ticking away, the Patriots showed little urgency with the ball. What gives? The Patriots slowly came to the of scrimmage and called running plays, not looking like a team down by 10 with potentially only minutes remaining in a season that held such promise. After they failed to convert on fourth down, they gave the Jets the ball back with 5:15 to play.




7:01 P.M.Jets 21, Patriots 11


Adam Hunger/Reuters Wide receiver Santonio Holmes (10) scored a touchdown for the Jets during the fourth quarter.
The Jets’ took a 21-11 lead with 13:00 to play on a beautiful 7-yard touchdown pass to Holmes from Sanchez. Sanchez threw to the corner of the end zone, and an outstretched Holmes dragged both of his feet in the corner of the end zone to make the catch count, silencing a stunned crowd here.




6:59 P.M.Sanchez Hits it Big (Again)


Sanchez has connected with one of his receivers for another huge gain. To start the fourth quarter, Sanchez hit Cotchery on a crossing pattern, which turned evolved from a short toss over the middle to a 58-yard gain as Cotchery tip-toed down the sideline.




6:51 P.M.Jets 14, Patriots 11


Matt Campbell/European Pressphoto Agency Patriots tight end Alge Crumpler celebrated with fans after his third-quarter touchdown reception.
The Patriots narrowed the Jets’ lead to 14-11 with 13 seconds to play in the third quarter.
After an eight-play, 80-yard drive that moved almost exclusively through the air, Brady scrambled around and found Crumpler in back of the end zone for a 2-yard throwing score. This is Brady’s 17th consecutive postseason game with a touchdown pass, which is second only to Brett Favre’s 20. The Patriots went for the 2-point conversion, and it was a success, with Green-Ellis plunging into the end zone.




6:47 P.M.Patriots Taking Flight


The Patriots have lacked an ariel attack most of the afternoon. But the Jets’ soft coverages might be ripe to take advantage of. The Patriots have moved to the Jets’ 14 thanks to passes of 37 yards, to Groncowski; and 16 and 12 yards, to Deion Branch. Will the Jets need to mix it up defensively?




6:37 P.M.Lanes Opening for Jets


Although the Jets’ possession seems likely to end in a punt â Sanches threw incomplete on third and 6 â there was a small glimmer of promise as this game moves to the fourth quarter: Shonn Greene’s run of 20 yards.
The Jets have not done much offensively, with the opportunistic play and a few nice passes helping put them ahead. But if they can start effectively rushing the ball, it could be curtains for the Patriots, who are playing against the clock as much as they are the players in the white uniforms.




6:32 P.M.Foxborough Fans Displeased


Michael Dwyer/Associated Press Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.
The Patriots fans are getting restless, booing after New England’s possessions. The Jets have continued to keep up pressure on Brady, whom Calvin Pace sacked to force a fumble for a loss of 12 yards; Green-Ellis recovered. It was yet another instance illustrating the Jets’ defensive success, despite rarely bringing pressure. For example, on Pace’s sack, the Jets were only rushing four defenders.




6:28 P.M.Will Jets Keep it Up?


From Bishop via Twitter: “This is about the best scenario the JetsÂ hoped for: No Sanchez turnovers, bottle Brady, win third-down, close on TOP. Will it be enough?”




6:19 P.M.Patriots Can’t Solve Jets’ Defense


So far, the Jets are employing a highly similar game plan to the one that helped them topple Peyton Manning and the Colts last Sunday. They are not blitzing much and dropping back into coverage, keeping everything in front of them. The Jets did similarly against Brady in the last game; that did not end well. But the Jets are stifling the Patriots with relatively little pressure on Brady. Will it keep up?




6:02 P.M.First Signs of Frustration


As the Patriots jogged to the locker room for halftime, they were booed by the home crowd. Before Brady took a knee to get to halftime, the New England left guard Logan Mankins was penalized for shoving Jets cornerback Marquice Cole. This was certainly an unexpected conclusion to a first half that â aside from a few poor throws from Sanchez and a missed field goal by Folk â went about as well as the Jets could have hoped.




5:58 P.M.Jets 14, Patriots 3


Cj Gunther/European Pressphoto Agency Braylon Edwards (17) scored a touchdown in the second quarter to give the Jets a 14-3 lead.
With 33 seconds before halftime, the Jets took a 14-3 lead on a 15-yard touchdown reception by Edwards, who fought his way through defenders to get to the end zone. The Jets, after seizing on the questionable decision by Belichick, have improbably taken the upper hand against the favored Patriots.




5:54 P.M.Patriots Fake Punt Fails


The Jets seize a ton of momentum before halftime. From their own 39, the Patriots appeared to try to fake a punt by snapping directly to Chung. It failed. Horribly. Chung did not cleanly field the snap, and the Jets’ took over with roughly a minute to play. The bold call by Belichick will likely be questioned by observers of the league, regardless of the outcome. At minimum, the Jets should get a field goal before halftime.




5:48 P.M.Belichick (Unsuccessfully) Throws Challenge Flag



Facing third and 4 on this possession, the Jets picked up first down when James Sanders was called for pass interference. On their next third-and-4 situation, the Jets picked up a first down after another play that required an official ruling.
With 5:16 to play in the second quarter, Patriots Coach Bill Belichick challenged whether Holmes caught a 5-yard pass from Sanchez; as Holmes rolled on the ground while wrestling the ball from Devin McCourty, it was unclear if the ball touched the ground. But Belichick’s challenged was unsuccessful, costing the Patriots a time out.





5:34 P.M.So Far, Opposite Offenses


From The Times’s Greg Bishop via Twitter: “The JetsÂ have now more than doubled their point total from their last game here. Meanwhile, the PatriotsÂ are far off their 42-point pace.”




5:30 P.M.Jets 7, Patriots 3


Al Bello/Getty Images Mark Sanchez celebrated a second-quarter touchdown.
The Jets went ahead by 7-3 with 10 minutes 24 seconds to play in the second quarter on a 7-yard reception to Tomlinson. Sanchez hit an uncovered Tomlinson in the flat, and Tomlinson won the footrace to the pylon. The score even prompted a J-E-T-S chant from a group of fans within earshot of the press box.




5:27 P.M.Sanchez Hits it Big 


After struggling with his accuracy early here â a continuation of his performance in Indianapolis last Sunday â Sanchez found Braylon Edwards on a 37-yard bomb down the left sideline. The catch brought the Jets to the green zone, and it was the first challenging throw that Sanchez executed well so far.




5:21 P.M.Brady Sacked Again


Winslow Townson/Associated Press Cornerback Drew Coleman sacks the Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.
With three sacks in their past two defensive stands, the Jets are starting to dial up some pressure on Brady. On the Patriots’ first possession of the second quarter, cornerback Drew Coleman blind sided Brady, bringing him down for a loss of 9 on third and 5. Coleman went unblocked to Brady, blitzing off the left tackle. Of note: the Jets only rushed three linemen on the play.




5:12 P.M.Sachez Having Accuracy Issues?


So far, Sanchez has not been on the money. There was the over throw to Cotchery. Then, just before the end of the first quarter, he threw wide on a short crossing pattern to Santonio Holmes. Sanchez has played poorly before in the cold weather; the temperature here is 19 degrees with the wind chill.




5:06 P.M.Patriots 3, Jets 0


Mike Segar/Reuters Shayne Graham kicked a field goal to put the Patriots on the board.
The Patriots took a 3-0 lead on a 34-yard field goal by Shayne Graham after an 11-play drive that stretched 63 yards. Though the Jets did not get much pressure on Brady â who completed passes of 28 and 10 yards â two sacks by Shaun Ellis bookended the possession.
While Ellis’s sack, on third and 5 from the Jets’ 7, forced the field goal, a player earlier, New England tight end Alge Crumpler dropped an easy touchdown reception from Brady. Crumpler shoved easily past cornerback Dwight Lowery and probably should have caught the pass.




5:04 P.M.More on Brady Interception


From Battista via Twitter: “First Brady interception in 360 attempts.”




4:55 P.M.Folk Misses Field Goal


Well, so much for that interception. After Harris brought the Jets to the New England 12, the Jets stalled, and to make it worse, Nick Folk missed a 30-yard field goal wide left. What could have been a prime opportunity was squandered. 
On the Jets’ first possession, Sanchez did not execute when given the opportunity; on their second possession, LaDaainian Tomlinson was stuffed on a short pass for minus 5 yards, preceding Folk’s miss.




4:53 P.M.Jets Intercept Brady


This is exactly the thing the Jets needed to start this game. Though they were moving well down the field, with short passes and effective runs, the Patriots’ opening possession was abruptly when David Harris intercepted a Brady pass intended for BenJarvus Green-Ellis.Â The short dump pass was not on target, and Harris rumbled 58 yards to the Patriots 12.




4:50 P.M.Cromartie Not Welcomed


Doug Mills/The New York Times Jetsâ cornerback Antonio Cromartie attempts to stop the Patriotsâ Alge Crumpler.
The fans in Foxborough made known what they think of Antonio Cromartie: they booed him lustily. After Cromartie tackled Rob Gronkowski, and his name was announced over the speakers at Gillette Stadium, they reception was not too kind for Cromartie, who used profanities to make known his thoughts about Brady last week.




4:48 P.M.Remember Me?


Oh, how ironic (or maybe not). The diminutiveÂ former Jet Danny Woodhead caught a flair from Brady, turning it upfield for a 19-yard gain, on the Patriots’ opening play from scrimmage.




4:44 P.M.Overthrow Spoils Opening Drive


The Jets first offensive possession ended when quarterback Mark Sanchez overthrew Jerricho Cotchery, who broke away from New England safety Patrick Chung for an opening on a post pattern. Though Sanchez found Cotchery for a 16-yard gain on the second play from scrimmage, his throw on third and 5 was poor, and it forced the Jets to punt it away.




4:44 P.M.Welker Benched for Start


From The Times’s Judy Battista via Twitter: “Wes Welker benched for the start of the game because of his comments about Rex Ryan’s foot jokes, CBS reports. Belichick not fooling around.”




4:40 P.M.Patriots Win Coin Toss


The Patriots won the coin toss. They will kick off to the Jets to get things underway here.




3:48 P.M.Jets’ Inactives


Here are the Jets’ inactive players: quarterback Kellen Clemens, receiver Brad Smith, fullback John Conner, linebacker Vernon Gholston, defensive tackle Jarron Gilbert, tight end Matthew Mulligan, tight end Jeff Cumberland and defensive tackle Marcus Dixon.




3:46 P.M.Patriots’ Inactives


Elsa/Getty Images The New England Patriots take the field on Sunday for the A.F.C. divisional playoff game against the Jets.
Here are the Patriots’ inactive players: receiver Taylor Price, running back Fred Taylor, running back Thomas Clayton, cornerback Tony Carter, linebacker Marquest Murrell, lineman Rich Ohrnberger, lineman Mark LeVoir and defensive lineman Myron Pryor.
Pregame | After all the talk, all the bluster, insults and controversies, the Jets and Patriots will finally settle the latest iteration of their rivalry where it was meant to happen: on the field.
The week before this American Football Conference divisional playoff game has been as vitriolic as any in recent memory. It has all been chronicled in the headlines: Jets Coach Rex Ryan setting the tone Monday by placing the weight of the game on his shoulders; Ryan taking a shot at the dedication of Tom Brady; New England receiver Wes Welker seeming to reference the Internet reports about Ryanâs admiration of his wifeâs feet; Jets linebacker Bart Scott saying that Welkerâs days in a uniform were numbered.
The Jets and Patriots split their regular-season series, with the Patriots memorably crushing the Jets, 45-3 on Dec. 6, in their most recent meeting. But the winner here on Sunday will face the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday in the A.F.C. title game. Ryan has called it the second-most important game in Jetsâ history, behind only their Super Bowl III win. Following the lead the tight-lipped Bill Belichick, the Patriots have mostly tried to address this as the next step in their playoff journey, trying to stay above the fray. 
But the focus has shifted from the locker room to the field. Now, finally, it is time to play.
