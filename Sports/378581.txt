Advertisement  Coming off a 30-11 blowout at Boston College last Saturday, Coach LOU HOLTZ of Notre Dame (4-2) is re-evaluating his approach with quarterback RON POWLUS and mulling some lineup changes for Saturday's home game against Brigham Young (5-1). "We looked at eight or nine different people changing on the depth chart," said Holtz, who also second-guessed himself about whether he had made Powlus's job more difficult by not pushing the first-year starter harder in practice. "I think that the only way a quarterback could be ready for all the various types of pressures and looks that they are going to see on Saturday is, one, to be on the practice field and number two, be under tremendous pressure from me," he said. "Then they are adequately prepared. "So I don't think he has been as prepared; not because he doesn't want to be, or not because he chose not to be, but the circumstances are such that he just has not been able to develop as rapidly as what I think he is capable of developing."
