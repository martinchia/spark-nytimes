The soccer transfer window in Europe slams shut on Aug. 31, which means itâs a nervous time for players stuck in unfavorable situations. Michael Bradley, for one, isnât playing for Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach these days — Coach Lucien Favre has said he doesnât want Bradley around — so all the midfielder can do is wait by the phone and hope somebody calls. Otherwise, the 24-year-old Bradley could end up watching a lot of soccer between now and January. (For what itâs worth, MÃ¶nchengladbach is doing just fine without Bradley, sitting atop the German Bundesliga with two wins and a tie in its first three games.) Eric Lichajâs situation at Aston Villa isnât quite so dire, but the promising fullback has yet to make the 18-man roster this season; he has been suiting up for the reserve squad instead, never a good sign. Lichajâs teammate, the newlywed Brad Guzan, seems as if he will be Villaâs second-choice goalkeeper again this season, so perhaps a change of scenery would help him, too. Amid the anxiety of potential player relocations, of course, European and Mexican leagues featured a full slate of games this weekend. Read on for a look at how some Americans abroad performed with their club teams.

Jozy Altidore: The last few years have been tumultuous for the 21-year-old striker, but for the moment Altidore is riding high on his early success at AZ Alkmaar. On Sunday, Altidore earned his first start for his new Dutch club and delivered two goals in a comprehensive 4-0 win over NEC Nijmegen. The first came off a rebound of his own header, and the second was a nifty left-footed shot off a feed from midfielder Adam Maher, who is already developing good chemistry with Altidore. DaMarcus Beasley: Beasley scored his first goal for Puebla on Sunday, an emphatic header that proved to be the decisive strike in a 2-1 victory over Pumas. (He also showcased some good dance moves afterward; check out the video clip.)   Playing on the left wing and occasionally sliding into a forward role, Beasley was active and influential for Puebla from start to finish. The Fort Wayne, Ind. native hasnât looked this good since his glory days at PSV Eindhoven. Alejandro Bedoya, Carlos Bocanegra and Maurice Edu: Fans hoping to witness the latest incarnation of Team America — all three Yanks now play for Glasgow Rangers — will have to wait a bit longer. Edu received a red card last weekend and was suspended for Sundayâs 3-0 win against Motherwell. The new signees Bedoya and Bocanegra are still waiting for their visas to be processed. Steve Cherundolo: After sitting out the first two Bundesliga games because of an ankle injury, normal service resumed this week for Cherundolo. The Hannover captain played 90 minutes in both a 2-1 victory over Sevilla in a Europa League playoff first leg on Thursday and a 1-1 tie against Hertha Berlin on Sunday. The latter result moved Hannover into second place (on goal difference) in the Bundesliga. Joe Corona: The former San Diego State University midfielder played an uneventful 65 minutes in Tijuanaâs 2-1 loss to Cruz Azul. The 21-year-old canât be held entirely responsible for his lackluster showing, as the Xolos focused the bulk of their attacks down the left side of the pitch. As a result, Corona, a right-sided midfielder, spent much of the game as on-field spectator. Clint Dempsey: Despite scoring two important goals in Fulhamâs 3-0 Europa League victory over Dnipro on Thursday, Dempsey was not at his best Sunday at Wolverhampton. He started up top in place of Bobby Zamora but failed to develop much of a connection with his strike partner, Andy Johnson. After the intermission, Fulham Coach Martin Jol moved Dempey back to left wing, where he saw more action — including several testy altercations with Wolves midfielder Karl Henry — but Dempsey couldnât produce much else in Fulhamâs 2-0 loss. Robbie Findley: The much-maligned striker came on at halftime Saturday and helped Nottingham Forest claw back from a two-goal deficit to tie Leicester City, 2-2. Findleyâs aggressive run into the box led to a Leicester penalty that Lewis McGugan converted in the 79th minute. Herculez Gomez: The 29-year-old striker got a bit of revenge on his former team Friday night, scoring the winning goal in Estudiantes Tecos’s 2-1 victory over Pachuca.   Gomez came on as a substitute in the 70th minute and delivered his decisive blow one minute before stoppage time — a sliding stab that lifted Tecos to sixth place in the Mexican Primera Division. U.S. national team midfielder Jose Torres started and played 68 minutes for Pachuca. George John: O.K., O.K., the F.C. Dallas central defender canât really be labeled an American Abroad just yet, but given the rampant transfer talk and Blackburnâs ugly 3-1 defeat to Aston Villa on Saturday, it seems more likely than ever that John is on his way to northwest England. Watch this space. Tuesday, 5:47 p.m. | Updated This deal is getting closer to being done.  Zak Whitbread: After toiling in Englandâs lower divisions for years, Norwich Cityâs injury-plagued defender finally made his English Premier League debut last weekend â¦ and promptly got hurt again. Still recovering from a knee problem, Whitbread sat out this weekâs 1-1 tie against Stoke City. Also: Timothy Chandler (Nuremberg) played 90 minutes in a 2-0 loss to Borussia Dortmund; Jonathan Spector (Birmingham City) started and played 72 minutes in a 3-1 loss to Middlesbrough; Michael Orozco Fiscal (San Luis) came off the bench and played 24 minutes in a 1-0 loss to U.A.N.L Tigres; Jermaine Jones made the substituteâs bench but did not play in Schalkeâs 4-2 victory over Mainz; Jonathan Bornstein (U.N.A.L. Tigres), Ricardo Clark (Eintracht Frankfurt), Eric Lichaj (Aston Villa), and Oguchi Onyewu (Sporting Lisbon) were not in their respective teamâs lineups. Corner Kick: Encouraged by the goals?
