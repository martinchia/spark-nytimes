PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. â The Mets play 36 spring training games this year, and 22 of them are against three of their four National League East rivals, including five of the last six games of the spring. Because of that, Manager Terry Collins said he would have his starting pitchers throw their last starts against minor league competition to  prevent the Atlanta Braves, the Washington Nationals and the Florida Marlins from getting too familiar with the pitchers they will face in the regular season. âIâm just not going to pitch them against those guys this late in camp,â Collins said. âThereâs no reason to expose them at that time. At that point in camp they will be throwing six or seven innings and thatâs a lot of looks, so I donât think we should do that.â With so many teams leaving for Arizona, the east coast of Florida is left with only the Mets, the Marlins, the Nationals and the Cardinals in close proximity, meaning those teams face each other over and over. Collins also said that he spoke to General Manager Sandy Alderson and asked if the Mets could travel across the state to Tampa and spend four or five days there in future years to play the Yankees, the Pirates, the Orioles, the Rays, the Blue Jays and other teams. âFor us to quit playing the National League East teams all the time, we might have to think about doing something like that,â Collins said.
