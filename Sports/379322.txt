Advertisement  Red Sox pitcher Roger Clemens said yesterday that he was confused and shocked by the decision of Bobby Brown, president of the American League, to uphold a five-game suspension and a $10,000 fine for Clemens's behavior in Game 4 of the playoffs last year. Clemens, a two-time Cy Young Award winner, said he would appeal to Commissioner Fay Vincent. "Let someone hear it that has a more open mind," said Clemens, who is scheduled to start Boston's opener in Toronto next Monday.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
