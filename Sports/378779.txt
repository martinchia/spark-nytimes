KANSAS CITY, Kan. — Ever since opening its new stadium June 9, Sporting Kansas City has been one of the hottest team in Major League Soccer, ascending to second place in the Eastern Conference and going undefeated in 16 of its 18 games since the home opener. The two losses, however, have come in eerily similar fashion with dramatic and devastating late-game collapses against Seattle on Aug. 6 and Dallas last Saturday. Despite its hot streak, Sportingâs failure to close out its two most important games to date at home gives reason for serious concern as it enters a brutal final stretch of its season. Five of its final eight games are against teams currently in the top four of their conferences. âThose are opportunities that we canât let slide anymore,â midfielder Graham Zusi said Saturday after the game. âOf course, itâs the playoff push right now, and, like I said, if we want to accomplish something going into the playoffs this year, itâs just got to be better.â  With a 2-1 lead in the 76th minute, it started to feel like dÃ©jÃ  vu for Kansas City. Forward Teal Bunbury was ejected after his second yellow card for a challenge on Jair Benitez, then Dallas stunned the 20,018 fans — Kansas Cityâs biggest crowd this season — by scoring in the 89th minute and extra time and escape with a win. The game followed the same script as Sportingâs only other loss at home, when Omar Bravo was sent off in the 59th minute and the Sounders scored in the 90th minute and extra time to win, 2-1. If Kansas City closed out those two games, they would be in first place in the Eastern Conference in a good position to make the playoffs. Instead, they are in second, four points behind Columbus and two points ahead of fourth-place Philadelphia. âRight now we should not focus that much on the standings and the playoffs and the standings and all that,â Sporting goalkeeper Jimmy Nielson said. âWeâve got to focus on our performance and how we get back on track and how we play a solid game, not a solid 20 minutes, a solid game, again. Because what we did tonight was not good enough.â  Despite the midseason surge, which included a 14-game unbeaten streak matched only by Los Angeles this season, Kansas City has only beaten one team this year currently ranked in the top four of either conference — a 4-1 win at Dallas in June. Saturdayâs loss was Sportingâs sixth loss to a top-four team this year. With possible playoff teams Houston, Philadelphia, Columbus, the Red Bulls and Los Angeles all remaining on its schedule, Kansas City is at risk of losing its remarkable momentum if it canât get over the hump and close out big games. âWeâve proven that we can be one of the top teams in the league right now,â Zusi said. âThereâs not a sense that we canât get there, because we know that we have all the talent in the world to compete for a title.â Was Sporting Kansas City lulled into a false sense of accomplishment with an early string of results to open Livestrong Sporting Park?
