DETROIT â The lineups are in for Game 4 of the Yankees-Tigers American League division series Tuesday night, and Joe Girardi is going with the same lineup he used in the first three games. Detroitâs Jim Leyland made two alterations with the right-hander A.J. Burnett going for the Yankees instead of the left-hander C.C. Sabathia, who started Game 3.  The Yankees are relying on Burnett, 11-11 with a 5.15 earned run average, to stave off elimination. But as many of the Yankeesâ hitters said after Game 3 on Monday, it is up to them to score some runs.    âWe need to get A.J. some runs early so he can pitch his game,â Jorge Posada said.  The Tigersâ starter is the 22-year-old New Jersey native Rick Porcello, who was 14-9 with a 4.75 E.R.A. In his career against the Yankees, he is 2-2 with a 5.56 E.R.A. in four starts. In one strong start against them this year, he allowed two runs in seven innings.  âThe key to the game is not A.J. Burnett,â Leyland said. âItâs Rick Porcello, for us.â The Tigers will start Don Kelly in right field instead of Magglio Ordonez, and Wilson Betemit at third base instead of Brandon Inge.
