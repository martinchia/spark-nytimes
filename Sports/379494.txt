News and notes from the weekend, on and off the field. Â¶ Barcelona completed its acquisition of Arsenal midfielder Cesc FÃ bregas on Sunday, ending a saga that dragged on so long that it felt as if the initial overtures were a bid to pair FÃ bregas with Johan Cruyff in the Catalans’ lineup. “It’s been costly, a saga of two years,” the Barcelona president Sandro Rossell said. “It’s like when a son returns home because we consider him one of us.” FÃ bregas, still only 24 but much older if you read every article written about this deal, could make his debut as soon as Wednesday, in the return leg of the Spanish Supercup against Real Madrid. Because, really, it’s not as if there would be any pressure on FÃ bregas walking right into that game. Â¶ As for the Supercup itself, Xabi Alonso’s low shot early in the second half gave Real Madrid a 2-2 tie in the first leg after David Villa and Lionel MessiÂ  staked the visitors to a surprising lead. Mesut ÃzilÂ  opened the scoring for Real Madrid in the 13th minute.  Real Madrid’s Web site reported, completely impartially: Tonight’s match proved football is sometimes unfair. BarÃ§a scored from the only two chances they had on Casillas’ goal. The Whites fought to the end supported by their fans.  Â¶ A late goal created by Ashley Young (later credited as an own goal thanks to defender Steven Reid’s errant toe) gave Manchester United a 2-1 season-opening win over West Bromwich Albion. But the game did exact a price: United will be without three quarters of its back four for a while after Nemanja Vidic (calf) and Rio Ferdinand (hamstring) both had to be substituted. Before the game, United announced that right back Rafael da Silva would be out several months with a dislocated shoulder sustained in training for the game. “We’ve had a torrid two or three days,” Manager Alex Ferguson said. “Rafael hurt his shoulder in training and is out for 10 weeks as he’s going to need an operation. “RioÂ hasÂ done  a hamstring and that will beÂ six weeks. Vida, we don’t know, as we need  to check that out tomorrow to see if it’s a nerve or not. He had a calf  problem prior to the game but wanted to play — he couldÂ be out for a  couple of weeks, so it’s a godsend we’ve got Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans.” Good thing. United’s next four games? Home to Tottenham and Arsenal, at Bolton, and then a visit from Chelsea. Maybe by then United’s new goalkeeper, David De Gea, will have his feet under him. The goal he allowed against West Brom’s Shane Long was softer than the one he gave up against Manchester City’s Edin Dzeko in the Community Shield last week. Â¶ Brek Shea scored F.C. Dallas’s second goal on Saturday night in its 2-2 tie at Philadelphia, capping one of the more memorable weeks for an athlete in that city since Rocky’s first fight with Apollo Creed. Shea also set up Robbie Rogers’s tying goal in the United States national team’s 1-1 draw against Mexico on Wednesday at Lincoln Financial Field. (Come to think of it, Shea’s week might have been better, since the Dallas-Union and U.S.-Mexico games both ended in ties. Rocky lost.)  Saturday’s goal was Shea’s 10th of the season for F.C. Dallas, tying him for second in the league. Only the Red Bulls’ Thierry Henry (12) has more. Â¶ Three of the four quarterfinals at the Under-20 World Cup in Colombia went to extra time this weekend, and two had to be settled by penalties. The result is a pretty solid final four: Brazil vs. Mexico and France vs. Portugal. Mexico was the only team to win in regulation, knocking out host Colombia on Saturday, 3-1. “There was a lot of celebrating when I went into the dressing room after the match,” Mexico’s coach, Juan Carlos Chavez, said. “When I came in, I turned off the music. Fortunately, we are in the semifinals but we are not champions. That is when it will be time to celebrate.” It really will be. Mexico has already won the Concacaf Gold Cup and the Under-17 World Cup this year. Goal, The New York Times soccer blog, will report on news and features from the world of soccer and around the Web.
