 The financially troubled Mets announced Tuesday that they were eliminating their minor league team in the Class A Gulf Coast League. That move could save them between $750,000 and $800,000, according to executives with other franchises who are familiar with the cost of running those teams.  According to Jim Duquette, who was the Metsâ farm director and their general manager and now is an analyst on Sirius XMâs MLB Network Radio, the move saves money but may also reflect a new drafting philosophy. The Gulf Coast League is usually for draftees out of high school and for international signees. Most college draftees go straight to the New York-Penn League or the Florida State League, where the Mets retain affiliates.  The Mets, who recently took out a $40 million bridge loan to cover costs, were one of only three major league clubs with nine minor league teams; the Metsâ include two in the Dominican Republic. According to MLB.com, 16 organizations have seven affiliates and 12, now including the Mets, have eight. Many popular and successful players got their start with the Gulf Coast Mets, including Edgardo Alfonzo, Octavio Dotel, Jenrry Mejia and A. J. Burnett. Many others passed through on injury rehabilitations, like Pedro Martinez, Todd Hundley, Orlando Hernandez and Billy Wagner.
