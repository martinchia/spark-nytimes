NO. 12 GEORGIA VS. NO. 1 LOUISIANA STATE
Southeastern Conference championship, Atlanta
4 p.m. Eastern, CBS L.S.U., which appears to be headed to the Bowl Championship Series title game win or lose, has one of the most formidable defenses in the nation and will be a big favorite. Cornerback Tyrann Mathieu, right, is in the center of the storm. Georgia has won 10 in a row, but only three of those victories came against teams with winning records. L.S.U. has eight victories over top-25 teams. NO. 13 OKLAHOMA AT NO. 3 OKLAHOMA STATE
8 p.m. Eastern, ABC For the first time since 1995, there will be no Big 12 championship game. But this in-state rivalry game acts as a worthy substitute, with the winner picking up the conference title and the B.C.S. berth that goes with it. Oklahoma State would seem to be a long shot to get a spot in the national title game, but a convincing win could persuade some voters that the Cowboys are deserving if L.S.U. loses. Of course, Oklahoma has won the last eight games between the teams. Both offenses average more than 540 yards and 40 points per game. NO. 5 VIRGINIA TECH VS. NO. 21 CLEMSON
A.C.C. championship, Charlotte, N.C.
8 p.m. Eastern, ESPN If Virginia Tech avenges its only loss of the season, it will win its fourth Atlantic Coast Conference title in five years. Clemson, which has lost 3 of 4 since starting the season 8-0, is looking for its first conference title in 21 years.  NO. 15 WISCONSIN VS. NO. 11 MICHIGAN STATE
Big Ten championship, Indianapolis
8 p.m. Eastern, Fox The inaugural Big Ten title game is a rematch of one of the most exciting games of the season, and now there is a spot in the Rose Bowl on the line. On Oct. 22, Michigan State handed Wisconsin its first loss when Keith Nichol caught a 44-yard pass from Kirk Cousins on the final play of the Spartansâ 37-31 victory. The Badgers went on to lose a close game to Ohio State the following week, then won four in a row. Wisconsinâs Russell Wilson has thrown 28 touchdown passes and just 3 interceptions this season, none of them since the Michigan State loss. NO. 24 SOUTHERN MISS AT NO. 7 HOUSTON
Noon Eastern, ABC A tough Southern Mississippi team is the only thing standing between unbeaten Houston and a spot in a B.C.S. game. The berth in that bowl game is worth roughly $17 million, money that would be divided among the teams in Conference USA if Houston secures it. The Cougars and their record-setting quarterback Case Keenum are two-touchdown favorites and look as if they will get a chance to prove themselves in a B.C.S. game. CONNECTICUT AT CINCINNATI
Noon Eastern, ESPN West Virginia beat South Florida on Thursday to win a share of the Big East title along with Louisville. A victory by Cincinnati would create a three-way tie atop the conference, most likely sending the Mountaineers to a B.C.S. game. If the Huskies win, Louisville will get that B.C.S. spot by virtue of its head-to-head win over West Virginia.
