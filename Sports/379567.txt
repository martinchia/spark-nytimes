Advertisement  Steeplechase  28-1 Shot Wins Grand National: Little Polveir, a 28-1 shot ridden by Jimmy Frost, took the lead halfway through the race and held on to win the Grand National steeplechase yesterday in Liverpool, England. Second was the 1986 winner, West Tip, who led for much of the race, faded and came on strong toward the end. Third was The Thinker, with Lastofthebrownies fourth. Last year, having jumped 25 of Aintree's 30 fences in style, Little Polvier unseated his rider and was unplaced. The owner switched trainers and the move paid off as the 12-year-old coped brilliantly with the heavy ground and a riderless horse late in the race to win by seven lengths in Frost's first Grand National. It was the second Grand National success for the trainer Toby Baldwin, who prepared Highland Wedding, the winner in 1969. The favorite, Dixton House, fell at the fifth fence, the Bechers Brook, on the first of the two 30-fence circuits.(AP)  Boxing  Fenech Retains Title, Then Retires: Jeff Fenech of Australia pounded out a unanimous 12-round decision over Marcos Villasana of Mexico last night to retain his World Boxing Council featherweight title, then announced his retirement. Fenech said he injured the brittle hands, which have caused him pain throughout his career, during the fight and had abandoned plans to seek a record six titles in different divisions. Fenech (23-0) is one of only 11 fighters in history to win world titles in three different weight divisions.(AP)  Soccer  Arsenal and Liverpool Keep Pace: Arsenal and Liverpool each won at home yesterday to maintain their battle at the top of the English League First Division soccer standing.
