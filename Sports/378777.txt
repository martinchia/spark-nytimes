Advertisement  ART SCHLICHTER, suspended twice by the National Football League for gambling, says he had a relapse because he wasn't serious enough about his recovery. Schlichter admitted Monday that he started gambling again in April and May, betting unspecified amounts on horse racing. "I did some things that were not very healthy for me," Schlichter said in an interview in The Cincinnati Enquirer yesterday. "I have to come to grips with the fact that I can't handle money; it's a part of the disease," Schlichter, a former Colts and Ohio State quarterback, was arrested Friday and charged with passing a worthless $3,000 check. He has pleaded not guilty. "When I came here, I think I didn't take serious enough my recovery," said Schlichter, who has been playing for the Cincinnati Rockers of the Arena Football League. The Rockers' general manager, KEITH SPRUNK, said Schlichter will play as long as he continues therapy and doesn't gamble illegally or bet on Arena Football games.
