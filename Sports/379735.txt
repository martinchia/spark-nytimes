Jimmy Rollins hit a three-run double in the seventh, and Roy Oswalt allowed three hits in eight innings as the Phillies evened the National League Championship Series with a 6-1 win over the Giants. Rollins also walked in a run in the first inning to give him four runs batted in on the night. Oswalt stuck out nine batters and helped himself with a single and a run scored in the seventh. Giants starter Jonathan Sanchez had control issues early, walking three batters in the first inning, but he settled down to pitch six strong innings before leaving the game in the seventh. He was charged with the loss. Cody Ross hit his third home run of the series, a fifth inning shot that briefly tied the game. The series moves to San Francisco for Game 3 on Tuesday afternoon. Here’s a recap of the live analysis of the game from Citizens Bank Park.



Top of Ninth Madson Shaky
 Ryan Madson allowed a walk to Buster Posey and a single to Travis Ishikawa, but there are two outs… Ryan Madson will pitch the ninth inning against the Posey, Burrell, and Ross. He has appeared in more playoff games than any other Phillies pitcher, and his lead is growing. A Pablo Sandoval walk and Freddy Sanchez single brought Charlie Manuel to the mound, but Oswalt convinced his coach to remain in the game. This after blowing through a stop sign in the seventh. It’s Oswalt’s world, folks. His best pitch of the inning: a 69-mile per hour 0-2 curve ball to Andres Torres after throwing the Giants leadoff man fastballs for most of the night. You could sing “Happy Birthday” between the time Torres swung and the time the ball arrived. Sergio Romo is pitching for the Giants. Oswalt is done for the night. For real this time. Remember when we were kids and this inning started? Seriously, there is nothing like the sound of a home crowd in a playoff game after a play like that. Football crowds are loud but different … it’s not the same sudden, tense eruption, immediate and cathartic. Inning over. This all started with an Oswalt single, and his decision to round third despite a red light. He probably knew it would be a long inning and didn’t want to hang around. Utley and Polanco pull off a double steal, but Ryan Howard strikes out. Jayson Werth draws an intentional pass. Jimmy Rollins, bases loaded, two outs. Something’s gotta give. Double switch for the Giants. Santiago Casilla is pitcher number four for the Giants this inning. Pablo Sandoval is also getting off the bench, which must be making the bench very happy. Ramon Ramirez gave up an RBI single to Placido Polanco after intentionally walking Chase Utley. Roy Oswalt ran through the stop sign to score. Andres Torres is not in center field for his arm. Jeremy Affeldt is in to play the spot lefty against Ryan Howard. Roy Oswalt lines a single to lead off the seventh — after working a 2-2 count — and ends Jonathan Sanchez’ night. Ramon Ramirez comes in to face the top of the Phillies order. Finally, someone catches a Jimmy Rollins flyout. Way to go, Renteria: that veteran leadership is just what the Giants needed. Sanchez baffled Ibenez and Ruiz to end the inning. Sandomir: The risk of showing a taped interview during live action was in evidenceÂ when Joe Buck’sÂ interview with Phillies hitting coach Greg Gross kept going for nine secondsÂ after the Giants’ Cody Ross had connected forÂ a home run, after hitting two Saturday night.Â You could hear Buck say he wanted to ask Gross about Phillies’ catcher when his voice went live–and viewers could see Ross about 20 feet from touching third base. Clearly, no network wants to be caught like that and it’s a rarity. But truth be told, these interviews don’t yield as much as you would like. Perhaps Fox should cut out a promoÂ or even a 30-second ad twice a game to accommodate these interviews when the ball is not in play. In this case, FoxÂ should have cut off the Buck-Gross chat and gotten back to live audio faster.
 Victorino doubled, advanced to third on an Utley fly, then scored on a Polanco sacrifice fly to center. Cody Ross delivered a bullet of a throw just wide of third on Utley’s fly ball. If he had made the throw, Ross wouldn’t be safe within 30 miles of Philly. From Sandomir: For years (and especially in the postseason), Fox’s production style has been to cut between pitches from the field to fans and players in the dugout. Often, the camera finds players, managers and coachesÂ doing little that is crucialÂ (Giants pitching coach Dave Righetti was just seen playing with his ear lobe, which might have been a sign or just a scratch) and fans doing what youÂ expect them to do: cheer, wave towels and scream. The question here is: what do you like? Is televised baseball always interesting enough to remain on the field of play between pitches or is it appropriate to cut away to what may or may not be demonstrations of off-the-field drama? One more question: how close is too close? Fox’s closeups are the tightest in the business,letting us count the whiskers on Giants starter Jonathan Sanchez’s face.
 The Giants are starting to hit Oswalt hard, but Oswalt escaped the inning when Edgar Renteria lined right to Jimmy Rollins and Jonathan Sanchez made a convincing argument for adoption of the DH rule with his at bat. The real question on everyone’s mind: what impact does Tim Tebow’s new option package in Denver have on the National League Championship series? We’ll now launch into a 3,000-word explanation of the delicate ripple effect that starts with a handoff to Correll Buckhalter and ends with a Cody Ross home run. Oh wait, we won’t? Editors are no fun. Solo home run, Cody Ross, his third of the series. The Phillie Killer credentials are firmly established. That had to be the longest at bat of Roy Oswalt’s career. Oswalt worked a full count and fouled off at least three pitches before flying out to end an inning that featured more Jimmy Rollins voodoo. Rollins, of course, hit the fly ball that Jay Bruce misplayed in Game 2 of the last round of the playoffs. In this inning Rollins his a pop-up that found the sweet spot between third base and the pitcher’s mound, the place where most tee-ball hits land. Sanchez has thrown 77 pitches through four innings, and his fastball is now coming in around 89 miles per hour after clocking at 94 in the first inning. Ryan Howard hit a ground rule double to left center with two outs, but Jayson Werth struck out for the second time of the night to end the third inning. Jonathan Sanchez has regained his control. There’s a perception that Howard is in a slump, but he had a double last night and a double tonight. He hasn’t had any productive hits, and he has had some ugly at bats (Javier Lopez will probably be rough on him in any circumstances), but he’s hitting. If you believe in “clutch” performance, you may think something is wrong with Howard. If you understand randomization, you’ll expect one of his near-future hits to yield RBIs. Â  So we’ve all seen the ads and heard the rhetoric: the Phillies lean to the left. Way to the left. But let’s check the facts. It turns out that the Phillies bat .269, slug .429, and have an on base percentage of .339 against lefties. Against right-handed pitchers: they’re just .256-.407-.329. It turns out that they are not the bunch of lefties their opponents make them out to be. While Ryan Howard’s slugging percentage drops from .513 to .492 against lefties, Chase Utley actually hit southpaws better than righties this year (he batted .294 with 10 home runs in 136 at bats against lefties). Switch-hitter Shane Victorino batted .321 with power (10 doubles, four triples, and six homers in 165 at bats) against lefties. And Carlos Ruiz? Just a .321 batting average. So don’t believe the smear campaign. The Phillies aren’t very left-leaning. They are well balanced to meet America’s postseason needs. The Phillies Lineup: Not too far left. Just right. (Paid for by the American Victorino Anti-Defamation League). From our own Richard Sandomir: Fox and TBS have different philosophies about their pitch-tracking graphics. Not only don’t they look alike, but they are not used the same way.  Fox uses FoxTrax occasionally (for standard and HD sets) for what it believes are important, defining pitches. TBS uses PitchTrax constantly (visible only on HD sets) so viewers don’t miss anything. Which do you prefer? Do you feel Fox is using FoxTrax for the right mix of pitches or do you believe that TBS is right by always showing it, making it a utility like the scorebox? Cody Ross earns boos from the crowd and a brushback pitch from Oswalt after a two-home run outing on Saturday night. He’s becoming the story of the series. The television folks keep showing Tim Lincecum in the dugout wearing a hooded jacket over his uniform. It’s about 60 degrees tonight, with little breeze. If Lincecum wants to shed his image as your son’s goofy friend, he should try to look a little less … childlike. You get the impression that there’s a slingshot and Pokemon cards in the pockets of that jacket. Or as Tony Siragusa said during a football broadcast about him today: “He looks like he’s twelve.” Also of note this half inning: Shane Victorino’s surfing adventure at the warning track to catch a deep Buster Posey fly ball. It’s been an eventful inning and a half. Three walks. Three strikeouts. Twenty strikes. Fifteen balls. No hits (the Polanco grounder was an error, not an infield single). Sanchez misses a lot of bats. Jimmy Rollins walks to bring Utley home. Sanchez has games like this: lots of walks, lots of strikeouts, minimal contact. If not for a 1-2 change-up that caught the top of the plate and froze Jayson Werth, this inning could be even uglier. Utley walk, Polanco infield single, Howard walk. This is the “wild Sanchez” you heard so much about. Already 22 pitches into the inning. One out. Chase Utley walked, then stole second base on the first pitch. If the Strat-o-Matic guys saw that, Sanchez will have a hold rating of +9 next year. Quick notes on how the Phillies play the Giants hitters: third baseman Placido Polanco plays in against Andres Torres to defend the bunt. The infield plays Aubrey Huff hard to pull, with Chase Utley in shallow right center. Charlie Manuel on Giants starter Jonathan Sanchez: “He’s got a real hard slider, and it’s a late breaker â¦ Watch his games: the hitters chase â especially when he gets ahead of the count â they chase his slider a lot, like down, out of the strike zone. And at times, he can get wild â¦ You’ve got to be patient, but at the same time, you’ve got to get a good ball to hit.” The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by Gary Matthews, also known as The Sarge, a star of the 1983 Phillies pennant team who also had a few great years with the Giants. Sarge wore a red beret when throwing the pitch; the man has more interesting hats than Minnie Pearl. The weather is beautiful in Philly, though there is just a hint of haze. The Philly skyline is a little foggy over the center field wall. The Cira Centre, a high-rise justÂ west of Center City,Â is lit with red lights and a shimmering white “P”. No word on whether the Delaware River has been dyed red. The Giants are a ragtag collection of misfits thrown together because there’s a job to be done, like The Dirty Dozen or The A-Team, or the guys Bruce Willis assembles to fly to an asteroid in a disaster movie. These guys were scattered all over major league baseball when the season started. Pat Burrell was a .202 hitting designated hitter in Tampa, Cody Ross was just another outfielder for the Marlins, Javier Lopez was exiled to Pittsburgh after a long run with the Red Sox, and Buster Posey was catching in Fresno. Last night, Ross hit two home runs, Burrell added an RBI double, Lopez performed crucial spot-lefty duty and Posey caught and batted cleanup to help the Giants defeat the odds-on favorites to win the pennant.
