Robin Yount played his last game at shortstop on Sept. 7, 1984, a week before he turned 29 years old. He shifted to the outfield in 1985, when he was still in the prime of his Hall of Fame career. Yount played all but 10 career games at age 37 or younger. Derek Jeter turns 37 in June. So the parallel of Jeter and Yount is far from perfect. Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman raised the Yount comparison at a breakfast with fans on Tuesday. According to ESPN.com, Cashman said that if Jeter ever leaves shortstop, he could see him moving to center field, because he prefers corner infielders and outfielders to hit for power. If Jeter is âever going to move,â Cashman said, âit’s probably going to be a Robin Yount situation.â On Wednesday, Cashman said he was surprised his comments caused a fuss, saying that âfor some reason” when he is asked about Jeterâs future âit becomes a really crazy loud story,” but that when he is asked to speculate about someone like Mariano Rivera, the reaction is more muted.  Over at his Hardball Talk blog, Craig Calcaterra points out that no player older than 35 has ever played 100 games at shortstop and 100 games at any outfield position. Historically, then, the Yankees would be asking Jeter to do something that has never been done before. Nobody knows if Jeter, who has never played any defensive position besides shortstop, could make the transition to the outfield in his late 30s. Everybody slows down eventually, and by phasing out Bernie Williams and Johnny Damon in recent years, the Yankees have shown they want young legs roaming center field. Jeter is signed through 2014, the year he turns 40. Because he has a June birthday, for historical purposes, 2013 will count as his age 39 season. Playing regularly at either spot â center field or shortstop â is rare at that age. Since 1946, only four players age 39 or older have played 100 games in a season in center field: Willie Mays, Otis Nixon, Steve Finley and Kenny Lofton. All of them had spent years playing center already, an advantage Jeter would not have. Now letâs look at shortstop. Since 1946, only three players age 39 or older have played 100 games in a season there: Luke Appling, Luis Aparicio and Omar Vizquel. Center field and shortstop are young menâs positions. Jeter is not young, and Alex Rodriguez seems destined to be the Yankeesâ designated hitter of the future. Asking Jeter to learn a new position he is probably too old to play would be asking a lot. And Jeter, we know, has way too much pride to embarrass himself on the field. Itâs a fanciful notion: Jeter, the iconic Yankee captain, playing the position of Joe D. and the Mick, of Murcer and Bernie. But the best betÂ  is that nothing will change, and that Jeter will stay at shortstop until the end.
