Advertisement  Jerry Pettibone, the coach at Northern Illinois the last six years, was named coach at Oregon State yesterday. Pettibone, 51 years old, was considered one of the best recruiters in the country when he was an assistant coach at Southern Methodist, Oklahoma, Nebraska and Texas A&M. At Northern Illinois, his teams compiled a 33-32-1 record, including 6-5 this season. Dave Kragthorpe resigned last month after compiling a 17-48-2 record in six seasons.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
