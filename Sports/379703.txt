The New York Marathon showcases not only the worldâs best long-distance runners, but also tens of thousands of ordinary adult runners from around the world. The New York Road Runners, which puts on the marathon, is also trying to get the next generation running, too. The group has created 83 free instructional videos that teach the fundamentals of running to coaches, teachers, parents and kids. The videos, called “A Running Start,” include a variety of drills and activities with easy-to-grasp demonstrations. They are aimed mostly as elementary and middle-school children, but can be used by coaches to help them teach their athletes. The six hours of videos took three years to produce, and can be viewed on the Road Runners’ Web site. They were made in response to rising obesity levels in school children as well as cutbacks in funding for sports programs, especially in lower-income neighborhoods where organized sports leagues are in shorter supply. âWe saw a huge gaping hole in youth athletics starting 10 years ago,â said Mary Wittenberg, the president of New York Road Runners. âWe saw that kids werenât moving enough.â The videos are lumped into different categories, like form, pacing, stretching and so on, as well as for elementary, middle and high school children. Most of the videos are at least two minutes long. Written guidelines are included below each video. Activities and nutrition tips are included among the hundreds of pages on the Web site. âWe break down running to different components as opposed to saying, âjust run,â â said Cliff Sperber, executive director of youth and community services for the Road Runners. âWe want to teach the kids to be physically literate.â
