Advertisement  Jeff Jones, an assistant at the University of Virginia, was named yesterday as the Cavaliers' head basketball coach, succeeding Terry Holland. The 29-year-old Jones played from 1979-82 under Holland, who announced last June that he would leave to become the athletic director at Davidson, his alma mater, after 16 seasons at Virginia. A native of Owensboro, Ky., Jones was a guard on the Cavaliers' team that won the 1980 National Invitation Tournament and reached the National Collegiate Athletic Association Final Four in 1981.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
