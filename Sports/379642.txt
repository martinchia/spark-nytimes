Judy Battista, who covers the N.F.L. for The Times,  answered questions from readers on Friday.   Judy was with the Patriots in advance of their game against the Jets on Sunday in the divisional round of the playoffs. She looked at the growth of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who is having perhaps his finest season in leading the Patriots to a league-best 14-2 record.  Those around him say Brady has evolved in recent years, fine-tuning and tinkering with skills that have won three Super Bowls, improving more than just his deep passes. He is a more active leader, seizing control of a young offense that lost its most talented receiver in the first month of the season and wound up as the leagueâs top-scoring offense.  She has also recently written about the new overtime rules for the N.F.L. playoffs. There are three other games this weekend — Ravens at Steelers and Packers at Falcons on Saturday, and Seahawks at Bears on Sunday. Do the Jets have a chance this weekend, and will the Falcons prove their doubters wrong? The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season. You can also find links to coverage from around the league, tips for your fantasy football team and discussion with other football fans.
