Advertisement By GERALD ESKENAZI It has taken most of this century, but that grand old harness race, the Hambletonian, once rural America's great sporting event, has finally made it up there with the Kentucky Derby -- in Las Vegas, that is. For the first time, there is a "future book" on the Hambo. That is, you can bet on it in advance, legally, if you can't wait until next Saturday at the Meadowlands. "We've already got half the advance that was bet on the Derby," said MIKE FERBER , race supervisor of the Stardust Hotel. He made the odds. "We put out a line in May and already have $10,000," he said. That includes a $1,000 play from LOU GUIDA , the owner of Honkin Hanover. Honkin Hanover opened at 25-1. The horse is now the 3-1 co-favorite. But if Honkin Hanover wins, Guida will be paid off at 25-1. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
