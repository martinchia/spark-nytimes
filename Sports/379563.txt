Sidney Crosby skated Friday, his first time on ice since experiencing a recurrence of concussion symptoms after a game Dec. 5. After the Penguinsâ morning skate in Sunrise, Fla., he skated for 27 minutes and sounded afterward like a player whose return to the lineup is far from imminent. âThe symptoms are getting a lot better,â Crosby told reporters after his noncontact workout. âBut no, I wouldnât say Iâm symptom-free. Iâm allowed to lightly exert. Thatâs positive. When youâre sitting home for a bit, itâs nice the symptoms are better and itâs nice to take that step on the ice. It felt good to be back out there. There were some restraints, but itâs better than being on the bike. Weâll see how it goes.â Crosbyâs next session will probablyÂ take place Sunday, after the Penguinsâ morning skate in Tampa Bay. When Crosby took the ice Friday, he saw all of his teammates with the captainâs C taped on their jerseys. (The Russian Evgeni Malkin had aÂ K on his). The gesture was one of solidarity by the Penguins, who have lost six consecutive games. A Pittsburgh columnist recently cited three sources saying the team held a meeting to discuss an interim replacement for Crosby as captain. Crosby laughed off the report, saying it was a product of the Penguinsâ slump and the Steelersâ elimination from the N.F.L. playoffs. He appreciated his teammatesâ message at Fridayâs skate.

âThat was a nice gesture, especially at a time like this when things are tough,â Crosby said. âWith all the adversity and some recent losses, itâs important to stick together. It’s good for me to be around the guys. Hopefully, I can support them and they can see I’m getting closer and closer.” Crosby missed the final 41 games of last season and the first 20 games of this season after sustaining concussions in the N.H.L. Winter Classic last year and in his next game against Tampa Bay. He returned to the lineup Nov. 21 and hadÂ two goals and two assists in a 5-0 win over the Islanders. He played seven more games, but after a game against the Bruins Dec. 5, his concussion symptoms returned. The Penguins have not reported that he sustained a concussion in the game. While Crosby admitted it was difficult to be out of the lineup and not feeling well again, he said his experience madeÂ  him better equipped to handle the setback and he was more knowledgeable about concussions and their treatment. âItâs a tough injury,â Crosby said. âItâs not clear-cut all the time. I know a lot more about how Iâm feeling and how to improve it, so I think to be more familiar probably helps a bit.â Slap Shot, the New York Times hockey blog, reports on the Rangers, the National Hockey League and anything that glides quickly across a frozen surface anywhere on the globe, from the snowy prairies of Saskatchewan to the frigid steppes of Russia and beyond, like, say, Phoenix.
