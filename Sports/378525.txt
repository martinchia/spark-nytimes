 Their swagger was undeniable, their energy inexhaustible. And how confident must the Texas Rangers feel after taking down the St. Louis Cardinals with a two-run eighth inning that gave them a 4-2 victory Monday night in Game 5 of the World Series.Â   Behind a sellout crowd of 51,459 roaring and rocking the Ballpark in Arlington, the Rangers moved within one victory of the franchiseâs first title. Mike Napoli again delivered in the clutch, knocking in the winning runs with a bases-loaded double. Adrian Beltre and Mitch Moreland hit solo home runs â the only mistake Cardinals starter Chris Carpenter really made â and managers Ron Washington and Tony La Russa continued their cat-and-mouse game from the dugouts. Great energy for the last game here.  



Top of the Ninth  Rangers a Win Away From a Title
 Thatâs it, Feliz shuts it down with a 26-pitch inning, getting Berkman to strike out with a man on first to end the game. (Although the ball skidded away from Napoli before he tracked it down close to first base for the out.) The Series shifts back to St. Louis for Game 6 on Wednesday with Texas a win away from its first World Series title. Napoli  has thrown Craig out twice tonight. He threw out 36 percent of runners this  season. Perhaps he could catch for the Angels now… Feliz struck out Pujols swinging and Napoli threw Craig out trying to steal second. Suddenly a tight situation got a lot less stressful for the Rangers. Feliz hits Craig with a pitch to bring the tying run to the plate. He runs the count full on Pujols. Feliz has now allowed a base runner in 8 of his 10 postseason games this year. But he did not hit a batter all season. Phil Coffin notes that Motte is one of four major leaguers from Iona. One was Dennis Leonard, a good pitcher for the Royals. Another was Mike Bertotti, a nothin’ pitcher in the mid-90s, and the other, Vito Valentinetti, who for a while wore the highest number in the majors back in the 1950s, No. 57. Andrus strikes out swinging with the bases loaded, but Texas leads 4-2, and the Cardinals down to their last three outs. And look whoâs coming in to close: Neftali Feliz. Washington worked his bullpen hard, and it paid dividends, setting up perfectly for Feliz to finish this off. That was brief. Lynn intentionally walked Kinsler before turning things over to Jason Motte. Rzepczynski struck out Moreland before La Russa replaced him with Lance Lynn. Rzepczynski allowed a single to Murphy to load the bases with Napoli coming to bat. Napoli, who belted a three-run homer in Game 4, sends a shot into deep right center for a two-run double. Thatâs Rangers 4, Cardinals 2. Texas still has runners on second and third with one out.
Nine R.B.I. in the Series for Napoli. Good grief. Four hits, three for extra bases. He is livin’ right. Michael Young greets Dotel with a double to the gap in right-center. Dotel strikes out Beltre swinging, but you have to wonder why not have Beltre bunt Young to third? I know, he hit a homer, heâs a power hitter, but the Ranger lineup is full of power hitters.  So with one out now, La Russa, of course, walks Cruz to set up a force play. (Dotel made that an adventure, rainbowing several tosses and throwing another one so wide of the plate that Molina caught it on a bounce.) And he pulls Dotel for Marc Rzepczynski.  Oliver may be 41, but the lefty reliever got the job done. He also got a nice play from Andrus, who went deep in the hole on a grounder by Furcal to throw out his fellow shortstop to end inning.
Great stuff. Getting more tense on every pitch. Even the roar of the crowd feels fraught with nervous energy.
Carpenter is done. Octavio Dotel will open the eighth for St. Louis.  Texas just made a change. After Molina reached on an infield hit, Darren Oliver, 41, replaces Ogando. Mike Adams throwing in Texas bullpen, too.
The Cardinals send Ryan Theriot to pinch-hit for Schumaker. Not sure how I’ll get through the off-season without hearing “written in the stars…a million miles away” every 20 minutes.Tue Oct 25 02:47:03  via webTyler KepnerTylerKepner  The Rangers leave a man stranded, and with that inning, Carpenter hit the 100-pitch mark. He has not exceeded that count since he threw 110 pitches in the Cardinals Game 5 clincher against Philadephia in their division series clincher. Holliday just bailed out his skipper. He ripped a single to center, sending Pujols to third. When Pujols made a wide turn, he drew a throw home, and Holliday took second. The Rangers then intentionally walked Berkman to load the bases for Freese, who flyed out to center. Rangers escape again. Still, wonder what Pujols might have done if he could have swung away. We remain tied at 2-2. Washington didnât hesitate to bring in Ogando for his team-leading 11th appearance this postseason. And why not? Cardinals had top of the order coming up. He strikes out Furcal, but walks Craig, to bring up Pujols. Most fans were already standing in the lower stadium bowl, and the rest now stood to watch the matchup of Ogando vs. Pujols. La Russa just made an aggressive play that backfired on him. He sent Craig, who was easily thrown out by Napoli. So with first base open, the Rangers smartly put Pujols on intentionally. Why take the bat out of Pujolsâs hands with one out and a man aboard? Let the best hitter in the game take his cuts. A long flyball from Napoli with runners on the corners, courtesy of back-to-back singles by Cruz and Murphy, ends the inning. But not before Beltre ripped a hanging curve from Carpenter into the left-center field seats to tie things up. Carpenter simply lost that pitch over the plate. Worse than the mistake that he made to Moreland. Looked like batting practice, and Beltre made him play. This could be it for Carpenter though. Rangers hit him pretty hard. After Hamilton gounds out and Young strikes out, Beltre tied the game with a long homer to left. That’s Beltre’s first homer of the postseason since he hit three against the Rays in the division series. Feldman prompltly gives up a single to Molina. A ground out advances the runners, but Punto goes down swinging. The Rangers got out of another jam, and have their Nos. 3-5 hitters coming up. Time to get the offense going. Rangers will need at least two innings out of Feldman to get to Alexi Ogando. Weâll see how long La Russa sticks with Carpenter, but Game 5 could again come down to a battle of the bullpens. Thatâs it for Wilson. After a one-out single by Freese,  Washington brings in Scott Feldman. Wilsonâs line: five and a third innings, four hits, two runs (one earned), five walks and three strikeouts. He threw a whopping 108 pitches, 57 for strikes. Carpenter now has at least one thing in common with Wilson. Both have botched dribblers back to the mound for errors. Carpenter bumbled one hit by Ian Kinsler with two out. Andrus then drilled a line drive to center field, but right at Schumaker to end the inning. Cardinals still lead 2-1, with Berkman leading off for them in the sixth. The chants of âLetâs Go C.J.: grew lounder, and fans sang along to âDeep in the Heart of Texas,â a tradition here in the fifth inning. âThe stars at night are big and bright …â You better know when to clap during the song, too, or theyâll ask you where you were born. Holliday, who grounded into a double play to end the third, runs the count full before again grounding out, ths time to short, to end the inning. It remains, Cardinals 2, Rangers 1. Skip Schumaker singles to lead off, and then Wilson walks No. 9 hitter Nick Punto! Thatâs the No. 9 hitter! Napoli just made a visit to the mound. Thinking heâs buying time for the bullpen to start warming up. Wilson stays in and Furcal sacrifices over the runners, before Wilson comes up big with a strikeout of Craig. That brings up Pujols, who the Rangers will intentionally walk for the second straight time.Â  But itâs bases loaded with two outs for Holliday. Carpenter again mows down Beltre, Cruz and Murphy for an easy inning. Both bullpens are fresh, and itâs an off day tomorrow, so wondering if Ron Washington and Tony La Russa will be quick to tap into their relievers tonight. Thinking Wilson might get the hook before Carpenter if things turn tense (or if he gets shelled here). Timesâs editor Phil Coffin points out that Molinaâs R.B.I. in the second was no surprise. The Molina brothers, all of them, tend to improve in the postseason. Berkman strikes out, then woofsÂ at home plate umpire Ted Barrett. He’s a great interview, by the way, speaks his mind in a refreshing way, but he has been jawing at the umps a lot this Series. Fans are starting a “Let’s Go C.J.!” chant as Freese lines out to right field.Â He then gets Molina to fly out to end inning. Is Wilson finally settling down? Rangers fans better hope so, especially since he has thrown 76 pitches through four innings. Cardinals 2-1. Elvis Andrusâs sent a bunt single to the left of the pitcherâs mound, where there wasnât a Cardinal to be found. He could have crawled to first base and still been safe. After a Hamilton single to left had runners at first and second, Carpenter escaped any further trouble by getting Young to ground out to short. But the Rangers are on the board, trailing, 2-1. It wasnât Napoli, but the Rangers are on the board with a shot to upper deck in right field from Mitch Moreland. No question that ball was a home run. Rangers cut the deficit to 2-1. Furcal opens the inning with a bunt single, and moves to second when Wilsonâs throw to first was low â the Rangersâ second error of the game. Craig sacrificed Furcal to third before the Rangers decided â wisely it would seem â to intentionally walk Pujols. Wilson works out of trouble, though, inducing Holliday into a 5-4-3 double play.
Now Carpenter has got to face Mike NAP-O-LI to lead off the third. The Rangers catcher has batted .372 since the All-Star break and has three home runs and 15 R.B.I. in the postseason. That average since the All-Star Game is second only to Detroitâs Miguel Cabrera at .377. And Napoliâs 21 homers since then is second only to Pujolsâs 24. Total walks, 2010-11: Gio Gonzalez (183), U. Jimenez (170), Ryan Dempster (168), CJ Wilson (167). Tough to watch, but this is who he is.Tue Oct 25 00:45:46  via webTyler KepnerTylerKepner  It feels like the Rangers never left the field, as Carpenter delivers another 1-2-3 inning. Here come the Cardinals again with the top of the order, Furcal, Craig and Pujols, due up. Chris Carpenter also made quick work of the Rangers in the bottom half of the first, his only blemish a walk to Josh Hamilton. Wilson had a tougher time in the bottom of the inning. After issuing a walk to Matt Holliday to open the inning, he threw a wild pitch that allowed Holliday to go to second. Wilson then walked Lance berkman before getting an out. But Yadier Molina followed with a one-out single to left to score Holliday that went under the glove of left fielder David Murphyâs glove, a fielding error that Berkman took advantage of by going to third. Â Berman scored on an infield grounder before Murphy made a diving catch Nick Puntoâs sinking liner to end the inning. Â But not before the Cardinals take a 2-0 lead. Rangers fans, if you believe in omens, here’s one: Game 5 started identically to Game 4, with Rafael Furcal ripping a line drive down the third-base line that Adrian Beltre speared. Just heard somebody reference Brooks Robinson, but I’m thinking more like Graig Nettles. Wilson retires the Cardinals in order on Albert Pujols’s flyout to center. Standing ovation for Roger Staubach. Maybe not the loudest of the Series here, but certainly close. They love Rodger the Dodger down here! He fired one right down the middle, too. Let’s see if C.J. Wilson can work the plate like Staubach worked over secondaries. Wilson has taken a lot of heat in the local news media, and this could be his last game as a Ranger. If he pitches a gem and wins tonight, should Texas try and keep the lefty?  Here are the Game 5 lineups. Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa made one change from Game 4, putting Skip Schumaker in center field instead of Jon Jay. St. Louis Cardinals  1. Rafael Furcal, ss 2. Allen Craig, rf 3.
