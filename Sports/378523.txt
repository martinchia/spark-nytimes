A closer look at three games from Week 8, with the benefit of film review:

Giants O vs. Dolphins D A win is a win, but there are reasons to be concerned about the Giants’ offense. ItâsÂ built uponÂ using the run game to establish balance. But on Sunday, the coordinator Kevin Gilbride & Company quickly abandoned the run and went aerial with three-wide receiver formations. The Dolphinsâ lackluster pass rush gave Eli Manning a clean pocket most of the afternoon. He spread the ball around masterfully, exploiting the absence of Miamiâs top corner (Vontae Davis) and the cautiousness of the Miami safeties in coverage. Still, as the game showed, the Giants do not have the personnel to consistently sustain drives in this fashion. They felt they had no choice because, on the ground, their offensive line got zero movement against the Dolphinsâ sturdy outside linebackers and three-man front (center David Baas, in particular, struggled). It was very telling that with the Giants up, 20-17, with about fourÂ minutes to play and the Dolphins down to one timeout, Gilbride went to the air three straight times. Dolphins O vs. Giants D In the end, the outcome was decided by a sheer difference in talent. Reggie Bush ran the ball surprisingly well in the first half. The Giants’ linebackers, particularly Greg Jones, were too slow and reactive. They were reading the ball carrier, rather than diagnosing the blockersâ initial movements and anticipating run designs. Miamiâs O-line did a good job schematically at sealing the Giantsâ D-linemen with angled down blocks. Eventually, though, frontline forces as powerful as New Yorkâs adjust. And when an offense canât respond with its passing attack, the whole game plan sputters. Corey Webster did a fantastic job at stifling Brandon Marshall, while Aaron Ross handled Brian Hartline. Matt Moore is not a very comfortable pocket passer. He moved the chains with impressive scrambles in the first half but could not control the overall tempo the way a quality drop-back quarterback would. The Giants finished things off by sparking their already potent pass rush with some great inside blitz designs involving Mathias Kiwanuka and Dave Tollefson. Saints O vs. Rams D This was not a letdown game by the Saints â it was a ârise upâ game by the Rams. They simply out-schemed and outperformed their opponent. The Rams showed a presnap blitz look on just about every play for the first 20 minutes, and did a superb job of mixing blitzes with eight-man coverages from those looks. Eventually they realized that offensive tackle Jermon Bushrod could not handle James Hall and Robert Quinn inside or outside, and inexperienced right tackle Charles Brown could not keep up with the wide array of textbook moves from Chris Long (who looked far and away faster and more explosive than heâs ever looked). So, the Rams rushed only four and were able to play physical underneath coverage outside (the apparently ageless Al Harris had a perfect game) while relying on fluid linebacker James Laurinaitis and aggressive, swift safety Daniel Stewart to hunt up routes underneath and over the top. This took away Drew Breesâs quick-rhythm throws,Â the bread and butter of the Saints’ offense. Rams O vs. Saints D The Rams took advantage of two short fields late in the second quarter to build a 17-point lead. The second half was largely about preserving that lead, which a Steven Jackson-led offense is built to do. Jackson ran with speed and tenacity. Heâs one of the smartest, most professional runners youâll ever find. A.J. Feeley did a good job of avoiding sacks against the Saintsâ torrent of six-man blitzes (the Saints’ linebackers and defensive backs donât just blitz â they blitz FAST). He missed more big time throws than he made, but he at least managed the game well. It helps that the Rams finally have a clear go-to receiver (Brandon Lloyd). Josh McDaniels got into a good play-calling rhythm after the first quarter. He made great use of presnap motion and formation designs that dictated favorable running lanes on the edges. Cardinals O vs. Ravens D Terrell Suggs owned this game. He is the best run-defending outside linebacker in the N.F.L. He can anchor and shed blocks playside and chase down ball carriers from anywhere on the back side. As this game (and many others) showed, Suggs is also a pass-rushing force. On many occasions the Cardinals foolishly tried to contain him with a single tight end. They paid for the mistake seemingly every time. Kevin Kolb was under siege much of the game (Arizonaâs offensive tackles remain problems; and the lineâs communication in pass-blocking, while better this game than last game, is still poor). Kolb was frantic in the pocket and relied too much on scrambling rather than proper pocket mobility. That approach will always compromise the rhythm of a pass play. Ravens O vs. Cardinals D The Raven offense was out of sync in the first half, which led to the slew of second-quarter mistakes. Not helping matters was that the Cardinals’ front seven did a bang-up job containing Ray Rice and the run game (Calais Campbell and Daryl Washington stood out for the second straight week, and Darnell Dockett was his usual intuitive, energetic self). The game turned in the third quarter when Anquan Boldin had one of the great 15-minute stretches by any receiver. He had four catches of 20-plus yards, all of them requiring spectacular adjustments to the ball or laudable footwork near the sideline. He also drew two pass interference calls in the end zone and another inside the 3-yard line. Remarkably, the Cardinals did not have particularly poor coverage on any of these plays. It was just a jaw-dropping performance from a physical, crafty veteran receiver. The Cardinals were able to calm Boldin down once they put Patrick Peterson on him. The first-round rookie is blossoming into one of the best cover corners in the game. A week after keeping Mike Wallace in check, Peterson blanked Torrey Smith and (for the most part) Boldin. Peterson has a great ability to shadow defenders with subtle physicality on deep routes. Finally, Joe Flacco had a career high in pass attempts and managed the game very well in the second half. A staple of the approach was attacking Cardinals blitzes and linebackers with quick underneath routes to the athletic tight ends Ed Dickson and Dennis Pitta. 1:54 p.m. | Updated  Bengals vs. Seahawks Thereâs a new trash-talking cornerback in the N.F.L.: Richard Sherman of the Seahawks. Heâs a fifth-round rookie who has cracked the starting lineup after injuries to Marcus Trufant and Walter Thurmond. He made his starting debut against the Bengals on Sunday and spent the entire game jawing at (AT, now WITH, by all appearances) A.J. Green. Sherman backed up most, but not all, of his talk. He had a nice interception on bump-and-run coverage (Green must learn to not carry his routes so close to the sideline â he becomes easy to guard when he does) and gave up little spacing against all routes, even quick slants. However, Sherman had an illegal contact penalty in the fourth quarter and also was beaten by Green for a would-be touchdown that Andy Dalton underthrew. The underthrow allowed Sherman to deflect the ball into the hands of teammate Kam Chancellor. It was an impressive, but also lucky play, defensive play. Sherman felt entitled to taunt Green about it immediately afterward. And after the game, too. âI would say heâs probably one of the most overrated receivers out there,â Sherman said on 950 AM in Seattle via The Seattle Times. âHe wasnât anything special. Dalton was a good quarterback. He makes good decisions, but A.J. Green is just a lot of noise talking and bad routes.â As for the rest of the gameâ¦Dalton made several nice throws under duress. Scatback Bernard Scott also had a few big runs that compensated (a bit) for Seattleâs underrated front seven stonewalling Cincyâs front line. Chris Clemons once again looked like arguably the best all-around defensive end in the N.F.C. He made the Pro Bowler Andrew Whitworth appear sluggish on several occasions.
