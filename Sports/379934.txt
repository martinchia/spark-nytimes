Advertisement  He has been named to six National Basketball Association All-Star teams and he's currently the league's second-leading scorer, so what does it tell you when forward DOMINIQUE WILKINS of the Atlanta Hawks doesn't even place among the top 10 players in voting for the 1992 East team? What it tells the Hawks is that something is amiss. As a result, the team asked for a review of the computer vote count. "It doesn't make sense when a player like CHUCK PERSON gets 309,049 votes and Dominique doesn't get half that many," said Hawks vice president LEE DOUGLAS Person, who plays for the Indiana Pacers, finished fifth in the voting at forward, behind CHARLES BARKLEY of Philadelphia, LARRY BIRD of Boston, SCOTTIE PIPPEN of Chicago and Person's Indiana teammate, DETLEF SCHREMPF. So far the league has released the names of only the top 10 vote-getters, but Wilkins's count is due tomorrow.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
