Advertisement  AP Bob Boone hit a two-run single in the seventh inning tonight to boost the California Angels over the Boston Red Sox, 3-2, and frustrate Boston's attempt to grab a share of the American League East lead. The Red Sox lost for the fourth time in five games and remained one game behind division-leading Detroit. The Tigers have lost 9 of 11 but Boston has failed to take advantage. Boone snapped an 0-for-12 slump with his hit, foiling Bruce Hurst's chance for his eighth straight victory. Hurst (16-5) took a 2-1 lead into the seventh but walked Tony Armas to start the inning. George Hendrick sacrificed and Mike Brown singled Armas to third. Advertisement Hurst made a belated pickoff throw to first and Larry Parrish's throw back to third was wild, allowing Brown to take second. Boone singled up the middle, scoring both runners. Advertisement Jim Rice had given the Red Sox a 2-1 lead with a bases-empty homer, his 11th, in the fourth off Chuck Finley (9-12). Boston took a 1-0 lead in the first when Mike Greenwell singled to score Marty Barrett, who had singled and moved to second on an infield out. The Angels made it 1-1 with an unearned run in the second. Armas's single scored Chili Davis, who reached second on Jody Reed's two-base throwing error.
