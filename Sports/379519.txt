 Derek Jeter was held out of Sunday’s lineup for a second straight day after Manager Joe Girardi revealed that Jeter experienced tightness in his right quadriceps during the Yankees’ 4-2 loss to the Red Sox on Friday. Girardi said he expected Jeter to be in the lineup Tuesday against the Chicago Cubs. With an off day Monday, he said he wanted to give Jeter three consecutive days off as a precaution. Before Saturday, Jeter, who is hitting .286, had played in seven straight games. “I think you have to be smart about it,” Girardi said. “There are times where you are going to have to give him a day off.” Last season, Jeter, 39, played in just 17 games while recovering from ankle surgery. He experienced several setbacks, and Girardi said he wanted to avoid a similar situation this season. “He’s not real happy,” Girardi said. “I told him missing one game is better than missing four to six weeks, if something were to happen.” (NYT) A version of this article appears in print on April 14, 2014, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: Tightness in Jeter’s Leg Keeps Him Out for Second Game in a Row.
