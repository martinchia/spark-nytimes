2:19 p.m. | Updated  Phil Hughes, who was supposed to start the first game of Wednesdayâs doubleheader against the Tampa Bay Rays, was scratched because of persistent discomfort from back spasms. Hector Noesi, a rookie, started instead. Manager Joe Girardi expected Noesi would be able to throw 50 to 60 pitches, after which the bullpen would take over. Noesi wound up throwing 55 pitches in two and two-thirds innings. He left the game in the third inning, trailing, 2-1. Both runs came on a home run by Rays left fielder Desmond Jennings in the third. Raul Valdes came on in relief. Girardi said Hughes, who first developed the problem Friday in Toronto while throwing in the bullpen between starts, was improving. But Girardi said he was not ready to pitch in a game. Hughes may throw a bullpen session between games Wednesday to assess his progress. Noesi, 24, entered the game 4-1 with a 4.01 earned run average in 28 games, all relief appearances. In three games against the Rays this season he had allowed no runs in six innings and given up three hits in 19 at-bats for a .158 batting average against. The Yankees entered the day looking to clinch at least a wild-card spot in the playoffs with one win Wednesday, and a sweep of the Rays and a loss by Boston to Baltimore on Wednesday night would give the Yankees the American League East title. Tampa Bay (85-68) began the day two games behind the Red Sox in the wild-card race.
