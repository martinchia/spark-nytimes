The N.H.L.âs second Heritage Classic will be played Sunday at McMahon Stadium in Calgary, a revival of the leagueâs first regular-season outdoor game from eight years ago designed to feature two Canadian teams. The first game matched the Montreal Canadiens against the host Edmonton Oilers. Montreal will once again provide the opposition, this time for the Flames. The Canadiens won the first Heritage Classic, 4-3, on Nov. 22, 2003, and many consider it the best of Â the N.H.L. outdoor games so far. It was played before more than 57,000 fans in subzero temperatures at Edmontonâs Commonwealth Stadium, and its most lasting image is probably that of Montreal goalie Jose Theodore wearing a stocking cap pulled over his mask to keep his head warm. That game was conceived by the Oilers after the success of the Michigan State-Michigan N.C.A.A. outdoor game two years earlier. The N.H.L. modeled its Winter Classic, the popular New Yearâs Day game featuring two American teams, after the Â 2003 Heritage Classic. But critics have accused the league of treating the Heritage Classic as an afterthought. They point to the absence of the game from the league calendar from 2004 through 2010 and the paucity of promotion given this yearâs game Â â consisting largely of a tractor-trailer with the ice-making equipment making four stops between Toronto and Calgary so fans could see the machinery Â â Â compared with that given the Winter Classic. N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman bristled last week when The Calgary Herald asked him to comment on the perception that the Heritage Classic was ânothing more or less than an appeasement to cranky Canadians â as the underprivileged child hidden underneath the stairs in comparison to the New Yearâs Day Winter Classic.â âThatâs absurd,â he said. âItâs baseless.â
 Bettman said that the purposes of the two games were different, that the Winter Classic was designed as an American television event to help âmove the needleâ of hockey popularity in the United States. âHaving said that,â he continued, âout of respect for the first game in Edmonton in 2003, and the fact that the game on New Yearâs Day was intended for U.S. TV, we believed it would be good for our partners in Canada and most importantly for our fans in Canada to offer an outdoor game that everybody was telling me they wanted, as well.â This is the first time the N.H.L. has staged two outdoor games in the same season. Bettman said those games, and the All-Star Game in January, created a hat trick of âvery expensive events to put on, very complicated to put onâ that creates a âlogistical nightmareâ for the league. âSo anyone that thinks weâre doing this, to use your words, as a matter of appeasement is wrong, because itâs hard to do,â he said. Hard, perhaps, but the Heritage Classic is turning out to be a lucrative undertaking. John Collins, the N.H.L.âs chief operating officer, said the game in Calgary was generating more sponsorship money than this yearâs outdoor game in Pittsburgh, even though the Canadian market is only a fraction the size of the American market. âSponsor dollars/activation are outstripping the Winter Classic,â Collins said Friday, explaining that âactivationâ meant sponsors using the event for their own promotions. âThe game is huge in Canada,â he said, âand in Calgary itâs really lighting up the market.ââ And he added that in the United States the Heritage game would be Â part of nine hours of Â âHockey Day in Americaâ coverage on NBC and Versus on Sunday. Collins said that because McMahon Stadium, with 42,000 seats, is smaller than the 68,000-seat Heinz Field, the site for the Winter Classic, the N.H.L. would not make as much gate revenue as it did in Pittsburgh. But over all, he said, the Heritage Classic will make about as much money as its American counterpart. âJust from a business point of view, why wouldnât you do a game like this in Canada?â Collins said.
