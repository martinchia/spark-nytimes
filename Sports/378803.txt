Advertisement  Buffalo's City Council agreed yesterday to put up $2.35 million to buy land and prepare architectural plans for a new arena to house the Sabres. With Sabres owner SEYMOUR KNOX 3d saying that the team could move from Buffalo or be sold if an arena isn't built, the Council authorized selling bonds to cover the initial expenditure. Mayor JAMES GRIFFIN had vetoed the expenditure last week, but the council overrode the veto. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
