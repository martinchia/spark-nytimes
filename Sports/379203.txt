Advertisement  Eric Lindros turned down a contract offer from the Quebec Nordiques that would have earned him more than $55 million over 10 years, radio station CJRP in Quebec reported yesterday. The station said that the deal was one of several big-money packages the club offered Lindros. Lindros was the first overall choice in the 1991 draft. But even before the Nordiques chose him, he made it clear he was not interested in playing in Quebec. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
