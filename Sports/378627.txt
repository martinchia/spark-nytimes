All of the attention in regards to the first-round series between the Yankees and Tigers has been focused on the marquee pitching matchup in the Game 1 between C.C. Sabathia and Justin Verlander. Taking a minute to look forward one day, to Saturdayâs Game 2, youâll find that there is a matchup that is possibly even more interesting. No, Ivan Nova of the Yankees and Doug Fister of the Tigers are not of the same caliber as Sabathia and Verlander. But between them a casual fan can find a lot of the elements that have recently begun to change the conversation in regards to how starting pitchers are evaluated. There was a time when Novaâs 16 wins and 3.70 earned run average would be enough to qualify the 24-year-old for future star status and would easily trump the 27-year-old Fisterâs 11 wins and 2.83 E.R.A. But as baseballâs statistics have matured, many fans have realized that wins are largely a product of situation rather than talent, and that E.R.A. is hardly the best statistic that can be used to measure a playerâs performance. Fister became a story this season for his lack of wins despite the quality of his pitching. In 21 starts for the Seattle Mariners, Fister put together a solid 3.33 E.R.A. but was just 3-12. After the trade, he went 8-1 for Detroit while compiling a 1.79 E.R.A., numbers reminiscent of the infamous Detroit trade that brought them Doyle Alexander from the Atlanta Braves. Alexander went 9-0 down the stretch and helped the Tigers reach the playoffs. Removing wins from the equation, and trying to account for strictly situations that the pitcher controls, a thinking fan can turn to the statistic Fielding Independent Pitching (F.I.P.) which attempts to simulate what a pitcherâs E.R.A would be if the performance of balls put into play was league average, thus taking away the guessing game in regards to the defense behind the pitcher. If we look at the matchup in terms of F.I.P., then the Tigers have a distinct advantage as Nova put together a respectable 4.01 F.I.P. for the Yankees, but Fister was far superior at 3.02 regardless of the disparity in wins. If you instead use the advanced statistic WAR, or Wins Above Replacement, Fister still comes out on top 5.6 to 3.6 (Verlander and Sabathia led all pitchers with an 8.6 and 6.9 respectively.) Now the Tigers just have to hope that Charlie Furbush, Francisco Martinez and Casper Wells, the players they gave up to get Fister, donât end up haunting them like John Smoltz, the player they gave up for Alexander, did.
