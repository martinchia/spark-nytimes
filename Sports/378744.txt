The Penn State scandal has the dubious distinction of having what seems to be a permanent place in the headlines sections of sports Web sites. There it is on ESPN.com on Wednesday: âSchool: Check of Sandusky Turned Up Allegation.â And there it is on Yahoo: âBackground Check Denied Sandusky Job.â Deadspin has a standing headline: âPenn State Scandal,â the most recent installment of which is titled: âJerry Sandusky Applied for a Coaching Job Last Year, Was Rejected for Pretty Obvious Reasons.â All of those headlines appeared in the wake of a report by the television station WHP that Sandusky, the former assistant coach at Penn State who has been charged with 40 counts of child sex abuse, had sought a volunteer football coaching job at Juniata College, a Division III school in Pennsylvania.  On Tuesday, the Deadspin Penn State Scandal post by Dom Cosentino reported on a young man who has accused Sandusky of sexually abusing him in a Penn State football building when he was 12 years old and also linked to a report by Sara Ganim in The Harrisburg Patriot-News examining whether Penn State had really become more transparent in recent weeks. The conclusion of her article: Really, no. (The headline on that: âPenn State University Shows No Sign of Lifting Veil of Secrecy.â) On Ganimâs list of âunexplainedâ details involving the former university president Graham B. Spanier, the former football coach Joe Paterno and the new Penn State president, Rodney Erickson: What âintensive study or research,â as required in Penn State policy, will Spanier conduct on his one-year sabbatical from teaching? Will Paterno teach a class, since he is still tenured faculty? Why did a university spokeswoman say there would be a national search for a university president and soon after say Erickson would remain president? Why wonât the 1998 police report that detailed a six-week investigation into Sandusky showering with two boys be released? What are the severance separation packages for Paterno and Spanier? Ganim also reported that Penn State âdeclinedâ to tell her Ericksonâs age. At another Big Ten school, Nebraska, the recent headlines have been about the volleyball standout Lauren Cook, the daughter of the teamâs coach, John Cook; as both Deadspin and The Chicago Reader have noted, she received a notably light sentence for a felony hit-and-run charge. In The Reader, Michael Miner cites the case as another example of the âatmosphere of expediency and entitlementâ that âenvelops Division I N.C.A.A. sports pretty much everywhere.â In the headlines for the next 20 minutes, or 20 hours: Albert Pujols. Specifically, whether he will re-sign with the Cardinals or jump to the Miami Marlins. What is it with that city and dream teams? And can a combination of Jose Reyes, Pujols and Heath Bell be the draw that LeBron James, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade are for the Heat? (If you throw in Mark Buerhle, who knows?) Tom Verducci, writing on SI.com, said the Cards might be smart not to keep Pujols: âAsk the Twins about the cost of keeping Joe Mauer a Twin for life and the Phillies about Ryan Howard.â Jon Paul Morosi on Fox Sports seconds that, writing that a 10-year contract would not âbe wise for the Marlins, the Cardinals or anyone else. The simple arithmetic of the concept is alarming: a 10-year contract for Pujols, in excess of $200 million, would last through age 41.â Of course, Pujols could go to the Angels, in which case that headline will be good for about 20 seconds. The drama Wednesday is not limited to baseball. Archie Manning told a Fox Sports Radio show that he didnât think it was a good idea for his son Peyton and Andrew Luck â Stanford star; Heisman candidate; very, very high draft pick â to be on the same team. (Colts, do you get that hint?) Per The Big Lead, Manning said that because Luck is ready to start in the N.F.L., he wouldnât really be happy in Indianapolis. Prepare yourself for sixth months of headlines about that.
