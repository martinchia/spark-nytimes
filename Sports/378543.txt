Fox and Telemundo, the Spanish-language network that is a division of NBC Universal, won the American television rights to broadcast soccerâs World Cup in 2018 and 2022, according to soccer and television officials. The rights fee was not announced by FIFA, soccerâs world governing body, but a person familiar with the outcome said that the amount was significantly higher than the combined $425 million that ESPN ($100 million) and the Spanish-language network Univision ($325 million) paid for the American rights to the 2010 and 2014 World Cups. Bids for the English-language rights for 2018 and 2022 by Fox, ESPN and NBC Universal were made in Zurich, where FIFA is located, on Wednesday, along with Spanish-language bids by Univision and Telemundo. Bids were resubmitted Thursday. 
ESPN had been widely considered to be the favorite to retain the rights for the 2018 World Cup, which will be played in Russia, and the 2022 World Cup, which will be played in Qatar. Because ESPN is the countryâs premier sports network and has heavily invested in American soccer, Fridayâs decision brought concern by American soccer officials. At the same time, there was hope that Fox might be able to help grow the sport through its various platforms. “We made a disciplined bid that would have been both valuable to FIFA and profitable for our company, while continuing to grow our unprecedented coverage of the World Cup and Womenâs World Cup events,â EPSN said in a statement. âWe were aggressive while remaining prudent from a business perspective.â ESPN said it remained committed to âpresenting soccer at its highest level across our platforms,â including the 2012 European Championship, the English Premier League, Major League Soccer and the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
