 Uruguay claimed its record 15th Copa AmÃ©rica championship on Sunday, beating Paraguay decisively in the final, 3-0, at the Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires and reinforcing its claim as the best team in South America. Luis SuÃ¡rez scored Uruguay’s first goal — his fourth of the tournament — and Diego ForlÃ¡n added two for the champions. The loudest cheers were reserved for ForlÃ¡n, his country’s most popular player. A year after he was voted the top player in the World Cup after driving Uruguay to the semifinals, he added a personal milestone by delivering his country’s first Copa title since 1995. His father, Pablo, and his grandfather, Juan Carlos Corazo, also have winners medals from the event. “This title means a lot to me because my grandfather won, my father won  and now I won,” ForlÃ¡n said. “Three generations who led this tournament,  ForlÃ¡n will be the last name in the history.”  It is probably safe to say that Venezuela and Peru would be wise to savor their trips to Argentina, Peru perhaps a bit more since it thumped Venezuela in the third-place game behind a hat trick by Paolo Guerrero. But it would also be safe to say that Uruguay must be regarded as the best team in South America — quite literally, of course, since it just won the continental title. But also because of its run to the World Cup semifinals last summer, and because it produces results game after game after game. Argentina has Messi and more strikers than it can use (though it has a difficult time choosing the right ones every game). And Brazil has Robinho and Neymar and the flair that people write poetry about (though that, too, was largely missing at the Copa this year). But no team in South America has two strikers who play together as well as ForlÃ¡n and SuÃ¡rez (when he keeps his hands to himself), or a back line as bruising as the one anchored by the likes of Diego Lugano, Diego PÃ©rez and MartÃ­n CÃ¡ceres, or a goalkeeper having a better year than Fernando Muslera. So while the Argentines hang their heads and the Brazilians try to get inside theirs, the Uruguayans should hold theirs high. It’s their time, and no one in South America is in position to say otherwise. Corner kick: Will Uruguay’s streak carry them all the way to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, or is their window closing after their World Cup and Copa runs?
