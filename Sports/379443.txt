When we last took a look at Adam Dunn he was hitting .165 and his slump seemed a mystery to everyone including him. Now, with a little more than a week remaining in the season, Dunn has improved all the way to a .166 batting average. As of Thursday Dunn was still playing full time. The fact that he has not been benched appears to be somewhat of a trend in which players are no longer protected from futility. There was a time when teams did what they could to protect their players from ignominy. Jose Hernandez sat out of quite a few games toward the end of the 2002 season as he approached Bobby Bondsâs record of 189 strikeouts. He sat out the last four games entirely and finished the season at 188. But the days of protecting players appears to be over. Since Dunn broke Bondsâs single-season record with 195 strikeouts in 2004, it seems that all bets are off. Bonds has fallen all the way to 11th on the career list, and there have now been four seasons of 200 or more strikeouts (including one this year by the Reds’ leadoff hitter, Drew Stubbs.) Dunn, meanwhile, has only 165 strikeouts this season, but his batting average has kept his futility in the news. While it is true that Bill Bergen holds the record for lowest batting average in a season qualified for the batting title, with a pathetic .139 in 1909, that is misleading since the requirements for the title were much lower then and he had just 372 plate appearances. If you apply the current standard of 502 plate appearances, a total Dunn has an outside chance of reaching, the lowest average ever produced was Rob Deerâs .179 in 1991, a full 13 points higher than Dunn. Often the butt of jokes, Deer hit 25 home runs and drew 89 walks that season, both numbers far higher than Dunn’s. Using the advanced statistic of adjusted O.P.S., which attempts to account for ballpark and era, Deer produced a 92, which is 8 percent below league average. Dunn is currently sitting at 61. What this means for the game is hard to say. An argument could be made that the teams have no obligation to protect the players and that to sit out a player that is productive (think Hernandez, not Dunn) just to protect his feelings is bad for baseball. The whole situation does raise the question of when enough is enough.
