Advertisement  MIRSAD HUSEINOVIC of Brooklyn College and CARLOS JAGUANDE of the Brooklyn Italians club team were named on Friday to the United States national soccer team for games at Costa Rica on Wednesday and in El Salvador on Feb. 19. The selection of the two midfielders, both naturalized citizens, is a sign that Coach BORA MILUTINOVIC is making good on his promise to recruit foreign-born Americans. Huseinovic is from Yugoslavia, and Jaguande was born in Peru. Also named to the team were goalkeeper BILL ANDRACKI of Rutgers and defender JOHN DEBRITO of Southern Connecticut State.
