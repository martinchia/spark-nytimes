KANSAS CITY, Kan. âThierry Henry is not likely to win the Golden Boot as the top goal scorer in Major League Soccer this season. He might, however, win the Golden Dunce Cap after his straight red card (video below) in the 28th minute of Saturday’s critical game against Sporting Kansas City.  His dismissal by the referee Kevin Stott, who did not hesitate showing Henry red after he collided with Roger Espinoza, means that the Red Bulls’ leading scorer with 14 goals not only left his team with 10 men for the rest of the match, but also means Henry will be forced to sit out Thursday night’s regular-season finale against Philadelphia at Red Bull Arena. Henry also received a controversial red card in stoppage time against Portland on June 19 when he patted the head of the Timbersâ Adam Moffat a little too hard for the refereeâs taste. The Red Bulls kept the game at 0-0 through halftime at Livestrong Sporting Park, and then faced a second half with 10 men. The club eventually yielded a goal to Teal Bunbury, then a second and lost, 2-0. In the midst of a hotly contested Eastern Conference playoff race, losing Henry,  who is currently tied with Dwayne De Rosario and Chris Wondolowski for the league lead in goals, only makes the Red Bullsâ task of qualifying for the postseason more daunting. The Red Bulls’ loss, and then another must-game against the Union, without Henry, makes the challenge that much greater. Do you think the red card was justified?
