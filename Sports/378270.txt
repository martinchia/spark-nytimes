Advertisement  DICKIE THON was named the winner of the Tony Conigliaro Award yesterday, presented to a major league player who has overcome adversity. The award was established in 1990 by the Boston Red Sox in memory of Conigliaro, the outfielder whose career was shortened after he was hit in the face by a pitch by California's JACK HAMILTON during a game at Fenway Park on Aug. 16, 1967. Thon's career was threatened on April 8, 1984, when he was hit by a pitch from MIKE TORREZ in a game between the Mets and Houston at the Astrodome. Thon fractured the area around his left eye, leaving him with double vision that prevented him from playing for the rest of the year. Thon played sparingly with Houston the next two seasons. He was released at the end of 1987 and signed with San Diego before spring training began in 1988. After playing in 64 games with the Padres, Thon was sold to Philadelphia in January 1989, and was the Phillies' regular shortstop the past three seasons. Last season, Thon hit .252 in 146 games.
