Advertisement  Bill Bergesch has returned for his third stint with the Yankees, this time as the assistant general manager. He will work with Gene Michael, the general manager, and be responsible for major league scouting, waivers and major league transactions. Bergesch was the Yankees' traveling secretary and stadium manager from 1963 to 1967, and director of scouting from 1978 to 1979, before serving as vice president of baseball operations until June 1983, when Murray Cook took over. The next year, Bergesch joined the Cincinnati Reds as general manager and served there through the 1987 season, again giving way to Cook. Bergesch was retired the last two years.
