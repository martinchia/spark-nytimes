JOHNS CREEK, Ga. — Bob Sowards, one of the 20 club professionals in the field of the 2011 P.G.A. Championship, shot a one-under-par 69 in Thursdayâs first round at the Atlanta Athletic Club. Sowards, a 43-year-old teaching pro at the New Albany Country Club in Ohio, was in one of the first groups to tee off around 7:30 a.m. He shot an even-par 35 on the front nine, then closed with a one-under 34 that included birdies on the 11th hole and the treacherous par-3 17th hole. Sowards bogeyed the especially daunting 260-yard, par-3 15th hole. âItâs my first under-par round at a major championship,â said Sowards, who is playing in his fifth P.G.A. Championship. âFor a club pro, doing something like that means everything.â  Sowards qualified for this yearâs event by finishing 12th in the P.G.A. Professional National Championship, a tournament he won in 2004. Asked his expectations for the rest of this yearâs P.G.A. Championship, Sowards said,: “Iâd love to shoot three more 69s but if I can make the cut and play all the way until Sunday, that would be special.” With roughly half the field having completed the first round, Sowards was the only club pro under par. Most posted scores in the mid-to-high 70s.
