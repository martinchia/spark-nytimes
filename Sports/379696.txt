Advertisement  Laffit Pincay Jr. knows all about riding injuries. He has had 10 in his 26-year riding career. The most recent, a broken collarbone, came Thursday at Hollywood Park when his horse, Dr. Damascus, a 3-year-old colt, broke a leg and fell. The mishap occurred 50 yards beyond the finish line in the ninth race. It was the second time this year that Pincay, who has won 7,472 races, second only to Bill Shoemaker with 8,833, had suffered a broken collarbone. The 43-year-old Pincay is expected to be sidelined for six to eight weeks, according to Dr. Mahmoud Nouh of Centinela Hospital in Inglewood, Calif. The colt, who finished seventh in the race won by Gringo Greg, suffered a fractured left cannon bone and had to be destroyed by the track veterinarian.
