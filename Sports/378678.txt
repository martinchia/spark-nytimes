Which team will win the coveted Faceplant award? Can Chris Johnson still play this game? And Blaine Gabbert and Andy Dalton endure rookie hazing. Here’s a quick look at Week 3:  Bills 34, Patriots 31 Thereâs no hesitation about hopping on that Buffalo bandwagon now. Capitalizing on a few good bounces, the Bills, for the second straight week, dug themselves out of a three-touchdown hole to win at home. Itâs time to start questioning the Patriot defense. It gave up 416 passing yards to Chad Henne, allowed San Diego to move the ball fairly consistently and, on Sunday, surrendered 80-plus yards receiving to four different Bills. These are signs of a D with an average secondary and a below-average pass-rush. Not that itâs fair to pinpoint just one struggling Patriot defender, but whatâs up with second-year corner Devin McCourty? 49ers 13, Bengals 8 Typical week for the Bengals: their running back butted heads with the league office over a coming suspension, one of their wideouts was accused of having Costo-like quantities of marijuana (eight pounds, really?) at his house, their fans did not show up for the home opener (a little over 43,000 were at Paul Brown Stadium on Sunday) and neither did their offense. Facing a stout 49ers run defense (25 straight games without allowing a 100-yard rusher), the Bengals had to ride the rookie Andy Dalton. Â He was under duress much of the afternoon (Ahmad Brooks had a particularly effective game) and could not climb out of third-and-long situations. His late-fourth quarter interception to Carlos Rogers was a case of not reading the over-the-top help coverage and deciding where to go with the ball before the snap. Welcome to the N.F.L. Browns 17, Dolphins 16 Every year thereâs one team that has a chance to be decent but, for various reasons, does a faceplant right out of the gate. It takes only about a month for everyone to realize that itâs a lost season for the club. Last yearâs Faceplant Team was the Cowboys (1-7 start). In 2009, it was the Titans (0-6). In 2008, the Browns (0-3 start after going 10-6 in â07). This year, you get the sense that itâs the Dolphins. They have 7-9, maybe 8-8 type talent, but 3-13 seems inevitable. Thatâs what happens when the powers that be donât believe in the quarterback or head coach. Titans 17, Broncos 14 Last week, the Titans got 53 yards rushing from Chris Johnson but still beat the Ravens. This week, they got 21 yards but managed to defeat the Broncos. Can they continue to win with their best player killing fantasy teams all over the country? The schedule says âprobably.” Tennesseeâs next six opponents are Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Houston, Indy, Cincy, Carolina. Mike Munchakâs club should be favored in four of those games. Lions 26, Vikings 23 The Vikings are footballâs version of a payphone: rapidly falling out of style and operable for only two quarters. Despite outscoring opponents, 54-7, in the first half this season, the Vikings are 0-3, which makes them the inverse of a Detroit club thatâs off to its best start in 31 years. Lions receiver Calvin Johnson has caught two touchdown passes in each game this season. None of those catches were half as impressive as his 40-yard basket catch to set up the game-winning field goal in overtime. There will be people who gripe that itâs unfair for the Lions to win with an overtime field goal without the Vikings even touching the ball. Perhaps theyâre right. But keep in mind, if the league implemented playoff overtime rules â where each team is guaranteed a possession â thereâd be a much greater chance at games ending in a tie. (Suppose, for example, a team caps a four-minute overtime drive with a field goal, and the other team responds with its own four-minute field goal drive. That would leave just seven minutes for them to break the tie.) Bottom line for this game: we wouldnât be having this overtime discussion if the Vikings had managed more than 32 yards of offense in the first 28 minutes of the second half. Saints 40, Texans 33 Donât become smitten with Wade Phillipsâs 3-4 defense yet, Texans fans. Your team stymied the Saints early in the game and then forgot how to defend the pass in the second half. Give credit to Saints tight end Jimmy Graham â his four catches produced 100 yards and 7 points, and all seemed to come in critical moments. Grahamâs athleticism can be a matchup-creating nightmare. And few coaches are as good at dictating matchups as Sean Payton. Giants 29, Eagles 16 Isnât it fitting that LeBron James was on hand to see this so-called âDream Teamâ fall to 1-2? The Eagles are experiencing the exact problems with Michael Vick that we skeptical analysts fretted about this past summer. Vick isnât staying healthy â after leaving the Falcons game with a concussion/neck injury, he left the Giants game with a broken right hand â and heâs not diagnosing blitzes with aplomb. His deflected first-half interception to Aaron Ross (who rebounded well from a tough Week 2) came about because he failed to recognize an A-gap blitz from inside linebacker Jacquian Williams. Vick had to elude Williams before throwing, which put him off-balance and compromised his accuracy, leading to the tipped pick. For the Giants, a win in Philly without Osi Umenyiora and Mario Manningham is about as big as it gets. Both injured players had their voids filled by rising youngsters. Defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul was dominant in pass-rushing inside and out, finishing with a pair of well-earned sacks. At wideout, Victor Cruz registered 110 yards and 2 touchdowns, one where he broke several shoddy Eagles tackles and the other where he outworked gazzilionaire cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha for a jump ball. Panthers 16, Jaguars 10 Cam Newton completed just three passes for 28 yards to his wide receivers. Blaine Gabbert took an awful safety on his first possession and was asked to simply âmanage the gameâ the rest of the way. This is how first-round rookie quarterbacks are supposed to look. Jags offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter was probably elated with the rainstorm that marred the second quarter. All season heâs been crafting run-heavy gameplans; this time, he could attribute this simplistic approach to a torrential downpour, instead of feeble quarterbacking. Raiders 34, Jets 24 Itâs time to have a serious discussion about where Darren McFadden ranks among running backs. Top 10 is an easy yes, and top 5 is not unrealistic. McFadden carved the Jet defense for 171 yards on 19 carries, including a career-high 70-yard touchdown scamper. The ex-Razorback is finally showing the fluid and powerful downhill elusiveness that made him the fourth overall pick in 2008. Most impressive is that McFadden is producing even though opposing defenses have no reason to fear Oaklandâs passing game. Jason Campbell is playing well and posting good numbers, but heâs still a one-read quarterback who lacks poise under pressure. Ravens 37, Rams 7 Torrey Smith became the first rookie in N.F.L. history to score on each of his first three career catches. And they were â98-Moss type scores. The first went for 74 yards. The second would have been for 50, but Joe Flacco overthrew Smith. So instead, it was for 41 yards two plays later. The third was an 18-yarder. Smithâs three catches for 133 yards and three touchdowns in the first quarter were all it took for the Ravens to pull away from a Rams club that is reeling with injuries. Chargers 20, Chiefs 17 The Chiefs had just completed a 23-yard pass to the surprisingly productive Leonard Pope and were within range to attempt a game-tying field goal at the end of regulation if they couldnât somehow muster a game-winning touchdown. But on the next play â first-and-10 from San Diegoâs 43 â Matt Cassel threw a soft screen pass that went right into the arms of Chargers safety Eric Weddle. Being a predictable play-call and poor execution, this would have been a microcosm of Kansas Cityâs disappointing season if not for the fact that no Chiefs came away injured. Nevertheless, the Chiefs are 0-3 and are perhaps a better fit than the Dolphins for the 2011 Faceplant Team. Packers 27, Bears 17 As Troy Aikman explained at the end of this one, those who didnât watch the game will look at the boxscore and blame the outcome on Chicagoâs refusal to run the ball (nine called run attempts, 13 rushing yards total). But the Bears had the right idea. Their offensive line could not move Green Bayâs increasingly powerful defensive front off the snap, and the way to attack Green Bay these days is through the air. Problem is, Jay Cutler struggled with accuracy (see the two interceptions by Morgan Burnett), the receivers all had the dropsies and no one could block the Packersâ edge ushers. On the other side, it was another day at the office for Green Bay. Jermichael Finley took his turn snagging Aaron Rodgersâs red zone touchdown passes (he had three of them), Greg Jennings caught nine balls (hard to believe it was a career high for the Â sixth-year star) and Ryan Grant took advantage of gaping holes on several slow-developing inside run plays to finish with 92 yards on 17 carries. Too bad the Packers players didnât practice together during the lockout, right? Seahawks 13, Cardinals 10 With all this conference realignment going on, now seems like a perfect time to move all the N.F.C. West teams to the Pac-12. Bucs 16, Falcons 13 The Falcons need to take a good hard look at themselves. Theyâre a power-run team that went up against a Bucs D that has finished in the N.F.L.âs basement in run defense the past two years and is thin and undersized at linebacker. Yet the Falcons rushed for just 30 yards and had Matt Ryan drop back to pass 52 times. The gifted receivers that are supposed to give Atlanta a high-flying offense got their numbers; Roddy White caught nine passes for 140 yards and Julio Jones had six for 115. Yet the offense finished with 13 points. Steelers 23, Colts 20 What an outstanding defensive showcase. Two players stood out for each team: Dwight Freeney and Robert Mathis for the Colts, and James Harrison and Troy Polamalu for the Steelers. All four made regular appearances in the backfield Sunday night, thanks in part to offensive gameplans that did not adequately account for the defensive stars. The Steelers tried to contain Freeney with Jonathan Scott (which almost sounds as funny as it looked). Early on, the Colts tried to run-block Harrison with Dallas Clark, and several times down the stretch, they did not account for Polamalu blitzing off the edge. In the end, the difference in survival was Pittsburghâs offense having more talent than Indyâs offense.
