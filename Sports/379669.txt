The hockey world lost one of its leading journalists last week with the death of Jim Kelley, who covered the Buffalo Sabres and  the N.H.L in a career that lasted more than 30 years. Kelley, 61, died of pancreatic cancer Tuesday afternoon at Buffalo General Hospital. He filed his last column from his home at 1:30  Tuesday morning. The column was about Brian Burkeâs two years as the president of the Maple Leafs,  and it was as full of wit, insight and sardonic humor as so much of what he wrote over the years for The Buffalo News, various Web sites including sportsnet.ca and sportsillustrated.com, and said as a radio commentator.  Kelley was the  president of the Professional Hockey Writers Association; was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame; had his shirt torn off in a memorable dustup with Dominik Hasek; chased N.H.L. officials around the HSBC Arena  demanding  a satisfactory explanation he never got on why Brett Hullâs Stanley Cup-winning goal was allowed to count when Hull was clearly standing in the crease; and wrote one of his last columns, on Nov. 19, on his last conversation with Pat Burns, who died that day. In 2009, when it was revealed that Kelley had cancer, Kelley wrote that he did not want to be treated or read differently. He carried on without fanfare and with such vigor, right to the end â so much so that when news of his death got out  Tuesday, many in the hockey world had not even known that he  was ill.
