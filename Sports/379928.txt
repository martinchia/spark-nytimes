Advertisement  Five months after he broke the 23-year-old long jump record, MIKE POWELL is still flying. Yesterday, he claimed another high honor. He was named the recipient of the Jesse Owens International Trophy as the athlete who best personifies excellence in athletic achievement and promotes sincere understanding among people of all nations. Powell, whose leap of 29 feet 4 1/2 inches won the world championship in Tokyo last August, will receive the trophy at a dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria on Feb. 4. Also expected at the ceremony will be the three immediate past record-holders, including BOB BEAMON, who set the record Powell broke, and RALPH BOSTON, whose record jump in 1960 was even more impressive than Powell's in one respect: It broke Owens's own 25-year-old record, which, like Beamon's jump of 29 feet 2 1/2 inches at the 1968 Olympics, was the oldest record in track and field at the time it was broken.
