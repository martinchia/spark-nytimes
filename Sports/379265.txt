Luck, or if you prefer a less loaded term, randomness, plays a significant role in any major league baseball game. A line drive caught by the third baseman might be rattling around the left-field corner if it had hit the bat just a few millimeters higher. A borderline strike three might be ball four with just a tiny change in the pitcherâs grip. Usually all of these events that could go one way or another balance out over 162 games and the season ends with the best teams at the top of the standings, but only usually. This season, the surprise team is the Arizona Diamondbacks, who at the start of play on Thursday held a two and a half game lead in the National League West over the defending champion San Francisco Giants. The Diamondbacks at 69-54 had already exceeded last yearâs total of 65 wins. Last seasonâs surprise team, the Cincinnati Reds, has backslid from a 91-71 record to a 60-63 record this season.  It seems apparent that the Diamondbacks are playing at a higher level than the Reds, but a look at their pitching staffs and batting orders muddies the analysis. The Reds are second in the N.L. in runs per game at 4.68 with the Diamondbacks just behind them at 4.56. The Redsâ pitching and defense, which has been their Achillesâ heel this year, is 10th with 4.34 runs allowed per game, but the Diamondbacks are in 11th at 4.39. So if the Reds are scoring more runs and allowing fewer runs why are they nine games behind the Diamondbacks? Bill James noticed similar cases while he was writing his landmark series of Baseball Abstracts. In response, he developed a runs-based win-loss estimator called Pythagorean Winning Percentage (pW-L%). Jamesâs original formula was that estimated win-loss percentage equals the square of runs scored divided by the square of runs scored plus the square of runs allowed. James found that this estimator was a better predictor of future win-loss percentage than a teamâs actual win-loss percentage. In essence, run differential tells us more about a teamâs quality than its win-loss percentage. Subsequent researchers have refined the formula and found an exponent of 1.83 rather than 2.0 models team performance more closely, but the basic idea applies well not only to baseball, but also to other sports. To give an example: the 2010 Reds scored 790 runs and allowed 685, for a pW-L% of .565 compared to their actual win-loss percentage of .562. In all, only five teams last year were more than three games away from their predicted win-loss record pW-L%. This yearâs outliers include both the Diamondbacks, who are five games ahead of what pW-L% predicts, and the Reds, who are six games worse, which combined with the Redsâ nine-game deficit in actual win-loss record means pW-L% predicts that the Reds are in fact better than the division-leading Diamondbacks and are nearly the equals of the Milwaukee Brewers, whom they trail by 12.5 games in the N.L. Central. The Brewers are six games ahead of their predicted win-loss record, thanks largely to a 27-15 record in one-run games. So what does this mean? The Redsâ 63 losses and the Diamondbacksâ 69 wins are already in the books, so nothing is going to get those âunluckyâ losses back for the Reds. But will the Diamondbacks continue to exceed expectations and the Reds fall short? Actually, we should expect the Reds to slightly outplay the Diamondbacks from here on out. Evidence shows exceeding or failing to match your pW-L% is not a skill or a fault, it really does appear to be random variation. If we look at the 502 teams from 1994 through 2010 when the leagues were split into three divisions, 256 teams exceeded their pW-L% from the start of the season to June 30 (roughly the halfway point). From July 1 to the end of the season, exactly half of those 256 (128 teams) continued to exceed their pW-L% in the second half. Of the 243 teams that did not match their pW-L% in the first half (three teams matched), only 115 or 47 percent continued to disappoint, while 125 or 51 percent turned it around and exceeded pW-L% in the second half. Team win-loss percentage at least in the long term is determined by runs scored, runs allowed and some luck. The evidence shows that beyond their ability to score and prevent runs there are no teams that just âknow how to win.â When the playoffs start, you will very likely be better served judging the matchups by each teamâs run differential, rather than their win-loss record. That 90-win team may have gotten there by absorbing a lot of close losses and steamrolling the opposition like Joe McCarthyâs Yankees in their wins. And the 100-win team may have eked out more than its fair share of one-run victories. Randomness plays a large role in baseballâs outcomes, but in the long run quality will ultimately win out.
