 OAKLAND, Calif. —  Unless the Yankees and the Oakland Athletics meet in the playoffs, shortstop Derek Jeter will make his final stop this weekend at the O.co Coliseum, the site of perhaps the most memorable defensive play in his 20-year major league career. Jeter stunned the A’s in Game 3 of their 2001 American League division series with a believe-it-or-not defensive gem. The Yankees had lost the first two games of the series at home and clung to a 1-0 lead in Game 3. With two outs in the bottom of the seventh and Oakland’s Jeremy Giambi on first base, Terrence Long laced a Mike Mussina pitch into the right-field corner. After tracking down the ball, right fielder Shane Spencer overthrew two cutoff men — second baseman Alfonso Soriano in shallow right and first baseman Tino Martinez near the bag — and it appeared as if Giambi would easily score the tying run.

He darted toward the first-base line, grabbed the ball and made a long, backhand flip to catcher Jorge Posada, who tagged out Giambi after he inexplicably did not slide.

It was a big play. It’s probably the play you see the most of — at least, I see the most of. I think all plays, all moments are special. I just never try to rank them.” Soriano said that play was “one of the many” great moments Jeter has had during his Yankees career, but he said it was the most amazing play he has seen because of “the situation” — in an elimination game and the play’s impact on the series. “Unbelievable play,” Soriano said. “I think, after that play, we had more motivation to win the series. I think that’s the big key of the series, that play.” 
                The longtime Yankees shortstop is in his 20th and final season. His many milestones and career highlights are compiled here with related video, and articles and photos from the Times archive.             The A’s plan to honor Jeter in a pregame ceremony Sunday, but his huge play from Game 3 reportedly will not be among the video highlights. “Is that right?” Jeter asked, smiling. “ I’ve seen it. I’m sure they’ve all seen it, too.” ELLSBURY RETURNS Yankees center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury, who left Thursday night’s game against Seattle in the bottom of the seventh inning with tightness in his right hip, was in the starting lineup against Oakland.

Ellsbury aggravated a nagging hip injury in the fifth inning when he slammed into the left-center-field wall and hit the ground while making an acrobatic catch, robbing former Yankees second baseman Robinson Cano of an extra-base hit. Advertisement “I’m obviously playing, so I’m just looking forward to getting back out there today,” Ellsbury said. “I’m going to get after it again today.” Ellsbury hit a two-run homer on Thursday, extending his hitting streak to 16 games, the longest active streak in the major leagues. “He brings a lot, offensively and defensively,” Joe Girardi said. “He brings that element of speed, too, that puts pressure on teams. You look at the catch that he made yesterday. You look at the important stolen bases. Some of the home runs he’s hit have been extremely important. He just has the ability to change a game in different ways.” CERVELLI’S REHAB CONTINUES Catcher Francisco Cervelli (right hamstring strain) was eligible to come off the disabled list Friday, but he will continue his rehabilitation assignment with Class AA Trenton through at least Sunday, Girardi said. Brian McCann is expected to start all three games against Oakland, and Girardi wants Cervelli to continue getting at-bats. “We’ll probably see him next week,” Girardi said. SETBACK FOR PINEDA The right-hander Michael Pineda, who is on the disabled list with a strained right shoulder, has not resumed throwing since a setback, and Girardi said he was unlikely to return before August. “He hasn’t started playing catch yet,” Joe Girardi said. “You got to build him up. That’s the problem.” The left-hander C. C. Sabathia (right knee) is expected to throw a bullpen session soon as he continues his comeback, but Girardi said Sabathia was unlikely to be activated from the disabled list until after the All-Star break. BELL SIGNED The Yankees signed the right-handed reliever Heath Bell to a minor league contract and assigned him to Class AAA Scranton Wilkes-Barre.
