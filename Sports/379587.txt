A federal district court judge Friday granted a request by Fox Sports to stop, for now, the Los Angeles Dodgersâ sale of their TV rights and wrote that a lower court might have erred in letting the process begin. The Dodgers had received the go-ahead by a federal bankruptcy court judge earlier this month to start marketing their future television rights about a year before their current contract with Fox allowed.  In appealing the bankruptcy courtâs decision, Fox Sports, whose Prime Ticket channel has a deal to carry Dodgers games through 2013, wanted to prevent the Dodgers from shopping their next contract to any of Foxâs competitors any earlier than Nov. 30, 2012.  In ordering a stay against Foxâs plan, United States District Court Judge Leonard Stark wrote that he was likely to rule that the âno-shopâ provision in Foxâs contract is enforceable against the Dodgers and that the lower courtâs opionion was likely âbased on one or more clearly erroneous findings of fact.â Earlier this month, United States Bankruptcy Court Judge Kevin Gross ruled that the âno-shopâ provision was not enforceable in bankruptcy court. Stark, who said he would issue a full opinion Tuesday, is to hear Foxâs appeal on Jan. 12. The sale of of the Dodgers and the marketing of their future media rights are being overseen by the bankruptcy court. Frank McCourt, the owner of the Dodgers, and the teamâs creditors, wants to sell the TV rights as soon as possible to get the highest possible price for the team, which could exceed $1 billion.
The sale of the team is expected to be concluded by April 30. The Dodgers believe there is a hot market for their TV rights that would result in a nearly certain bidding war among Fox, Time Warner Cable, AT&T, and DirecTV, among others.
