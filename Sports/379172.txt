Burton, 20 years old, had seven birdie putts and chipped in a 30-footer for another as she sloshed around the 6,389-yard DuPont Country Club course for a six-under-par 136 in the 54-hole tournament. Burton broke the course record of 64 set last year by Tammie Green. Okamoto, who shot a 69, had started the second round tied with Nancy Lopez and Katie Peterson-Parker, but they slipped out of contention. Judy Dickinson and Deb Richard were tied for second, two shots back. (AP) Third N.C.A.A.
