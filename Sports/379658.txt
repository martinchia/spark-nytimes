All hail the clicker.  With so much talk this season about the expansion of the N.C.A.A. menâs basketball tournament to 68 teams, it may not be hyperbole to suggest the most significant change in the eventâs history — at least from a fan’s perspective — is this yearâs sharing of the games by four different television networks.  At this point, remote controls across the United States must be in desperate need of fresh batteries.  Saturday evening was a prime example of the college hoop junkieâs new heaven. Simultaneously, you had TNT carrying San Diego Stateâs double-overtime victory over Temple, TBS showing the second half of Butlerâs eventual (and bizarre) last-second upset of Pittsburgh, and CBS broadcasting another day at the office for the Brigham Young scoring machine Jimmer Fredette, as his Cougars routed Gonzaga.  The viewing audience has obviously taken to it. For the first three full days of the tournament â Thursday, Friday and Saturday â the combined overnight Nielsen ratings in metered markets for games on CBS, TBS, TNT and truTV were up 24, 31 and 12 percent over last year, when games appeared only on CBS. The overall tournament average to date is up 18 percent, which includes the First Four games on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Many changes are controversial; assuming you have cable, this one isnât. Watch the game you want whenever you want â switching is now all in the fanâs hands. Splitting tournament TV four ways is a slam dunk success.
