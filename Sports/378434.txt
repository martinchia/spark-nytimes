Advertisement  A judge in Tuscaloosa, Ala., sentenced DAVID PALMER, a University of Alabama wide receiver, to two years probation in a drunken driving case yesterday and told him he would go to jail if arrested for driving under the influence during his probation. The Sept. 6 drunken-driving arrest was Palmer's second in less than three months. Palmer, 19, pleaded guilty after Tuscaloosa County District Judge GAY M. LAKE JR.  refused to grant him youthful offender status. Palmer also pleaded guilty to a speeding charge. Lake told Palmer that if he was arrested again on a charge of driving under the influence in the next two years, he would go to jail for 10 days. Palmer was also fined $250 and ordered to pay a $74 court fee in the D.U.I. case. He was fined $20 for speeding. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
