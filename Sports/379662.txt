Phil Miller covered the Utah Jazz for The Salt Lake Tribune from 2002 to 2007. Jerry Sloanâs coaching style was the subject of tributes and testimonials last week, but a more acute critique came a half-dozen years ago in the form of an ice bag in Greg Ostertagâs right hand. Fed up with Sloanâs postgame harangue about a Utah Jazz loss, the 7-foot-2 Ostertag chucked the handiest missile he could find at the silver-haired Sloan. Witnesses said Sloan simply ducked and continued his lecture unfazed.
Such was the practice of player relations during Sloanâs 23 seasons in Utah, an era that ended abruptly on Thursday with his resignation and that of his chief counsel, Phil Johnson. âIâm not here to be loved,â Sloan said probably 100 times each season. But he was loved, or at least respected, by nearly everyone he came in contact with during his coaching tenure, the longest in N.B.A. history. Even Ostertag, whose annual clashes with Sloan were almost as rote as a Stockton-to-Malone pick-and-roll, treasured their relationship. His was one of the first calls Sloan received upon announcing his departure.

Sloanâs public image, at least outside Utah, is one of intensity, ferocity, perhaps a touch of rage, all born of the courtside competitiveness that television cameras capture. He screams at his players, rants at referees. He is the N.B.A. career leader in technical fouls, and made headlines in 2003 by responding to a provocative remark by the referee Courtney Kirkland with a shove, a breach of decorum that earned a seven-game suspension. The sideline lunatic of popular perception, however, is almost the antithesis of the off-the-court Sloan. He is witty and self-deprecating, considerate and generous; an hour before each home game, he routinely stationed himself on a corner of the court to sign autographs and pose for photos. In a league filled with Lamborghini egos, Sloan is pickup-truck humble. His speech is peppered with southern Illinois slang and quaint country metaphors. He regularly compared the Jazzâs young players to horses approaching a fence, âand weâll see whether they rear up.â He deplored it when they âplayed like they were wearing tuxedoes,â and disliked it when a game devolved into mere âjackpotting around.â If the players were not willing to work hard, he frequently said, âmaybe someone will come along and give them a handful of candy.â So unpretentious were Sloan and his staff, they ate their pregame meals in the media dining room, sitting among the reporters other coaches avoid. Though he never enjoyed interviews, he did not turn them down either. News-media relations is part of the job, he believed, and he detested the notion of not living up to his responsibilities. Sloan would not allow his players to shirk them either. After one game in 2005, Sloan walked through the Jazzâs locker room and noticed reporters waiting. Told that most players routinely spent a half-hour in the trainerâs room, off limits to reporters, until the throng dissipated, Sloan strode into the trainerâs room. Thirty seconds later, 10 players filed out and took questions. Sloan valued steadfastness in the face of challenge above all, and his teams were the model of discipline and teamwork, running precise screens and rigid patterns that stood out in a sport that increasingly embraced improvisation. His players were not allowed to wear headbands for fear of calling attention to the individual over the team. But the line between perseverance and intransigence is thin. Sloanâs offense was either relentless or predictable, depending upon your view, and Deron Williams, with a competitive fire the equal of his coachâs, was only the latest player to chafe at the Jazzâs confining structure. In the N.B.A., though, superstar players are too priceless to alienate, too important to silence, and Sloan seemed to sense that another internal battle might turn nuclear. Either he was unwilling to wage it â âMy energy level has dropped off quite a bit,â he said at his farewell â or he feared the damage to the franchise that stuck with him. And it was a shock to those who have watched him wage such battles for decades. Karl Malone said Sloan once challenged him to a fistfight during a team huddle. âHe said, âIâll fight you as long as I can see you,â” Malone said Friday at a news conference. âAnd I said, âIt wonât be long.â We laughed about it. Thatâs the coach I know.â
