Advertisement By BARBARA LLOYD and  Dennis Conner, who last month looked as if he had lost his habit of winning America's Cup races, has rediscovered his old ways. Today, in the trials for prospective cup defenders, Conner's Stars & Stripes beat America3, one of Bill Koch's two contenders, by 45 seconds. It was the fourth time in a row that Conner had whipped a Koch boat here. In the final two matches of the last round of defender-trial races, Conner beat America3 and Defiant, one of Koch's older yachts.

The victory today put the Conner team into the lead in the defenders' standing for the first time since the race series started in January. Stars & Stripes now has 3 points, Kanza has 2, and America3 has none. The match today was one of the closest races yet in cup trials. The lead between the two boats changed three times in the first leg, with Stars & Stripes rounding the first mark ahead by 25 seconds.

Buddy Melges, his alternate helmsman, then took over. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
