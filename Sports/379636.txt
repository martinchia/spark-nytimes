Pat Summerall is best known as the former lead voice of N.F.L. games for CBS and Fox, not as a kicker and occasional tight end and defensive end for the Chicago Cardinals and the Giants. His new book, âGiants: What I Learned About Life From Vince Lombardi and Tom Landry,” recalls the influence exerted by Lombardi, who coached the Giantsâ offense, and Landry, who coached their defense, on him and the team. Once Summerall became a Giant in 1958, he sat in on the offensive and defensive meetings. It was the season when the Giants lost to the Baltimore Colts, 23-17, in overtime, in the N.F.L. championship game. Q. You write that one reason the Giants lost that game was that Lombardi and Landry didnât adjust to what the Colts were doing. A. I never thought either of them was very good at changing the game plan or making new plans. Landry dealt largely in percentages. I donât think we ever adjusted to what Johnny Unitas and Raymond Berry were doing to us. Q. What stands out about your first encounter with Lombardi? A. He walked in with his horn-rimmed glasses and the odd shape that he had. He cleared his throat and the room got quiet. I was sitting next to Don Heinrich and said, âWho the hell is that?â and he said, âThatâs Lombardi, and youâll know soon enough.” Just listening to him present what he had in mind and how the hush fell over the room let you know this guy had command and confidence in what he was saying. I remember I was sorry when he got through talking, and that didnât happen often in the meeting room.  Q. You say it was thrilling to listen to him speak. A. He had such confidence in what he was saying, and I think really thatâs what set him apart â the dynamic manner that he represented things. He knew how long your first step should be, how much the off guard had to pull to lead the sweep play and how long the first step should be so he wouldnât step on the quarterback who was still trying to get away from the center. Q. Landry became your kicking guru, didnât he? A. He said if you miss to the right, this is what youâre doing wrong. If you miss to left, this is what youâre doing wrong. And when you practice, make sure you have someone who knows whatâs going on because it doesnât do any good to practice bad habits. Q. Who was the better coach, Lombardi or Landry? A. Iâm not sure. Immediately, Lombardi made a lasting impression. Landry took some time to get used to because you never knew where you stood with him. Lombardi was so confident in the way he spoke; Landry was, too, but he had less of a commanding personality. I think the only time I saw Landry smile was when I told him Iâd been baptized. Q. Why did you decide to kick? A. They had a better kicker in high school. When I was in college, whoever was kicking off wasnât doing a very good job, so the coaching staff said anybody who thinks they can kick, come out 15 minutes early, so I came out 15 minutes early. Q. That you became a football player â or an athlete â is almost astonishing. A. I was born with a club foot. The left foot was turned around backwards and the doctor had enough courage, when I was an infant, to break it and turn it around. Q. After your retirement, you became a broadcaster. But Art Rooney, the Pittsburgh Steelers owner, made you an unusual offer in 1969, didnât he? A. It was Super Bowl III. I was staying at the Galt Ocean Mile and Art Rooney was in the checkout line right in front of me and I asked him if he had a coach yet. And he said, âNo, do you want the job?â I thought he was kidding, but he said it again, âDo you want the job?â And I said, “Iâve just started in the broadcasting job and thatâs where I want to go.” He said, âIf you want the job, itâs yours.â Two weeks later, he hired Chuck Noll. Q. Why would a man so steeped in football think you were a good candidate to coach his team? A. I had no idea at the time and I have no idea now. I didnât have a coaching record. I didnât have a record as a player to speak of except I played against teams he ran. I never have known why. Q. At CBS, you became the go-to guy to interview Lombardi or his players when he coached the Packers. A. Everybody at CBS was deathly afraid of him. Iâd ask him if I could interview players during the warm-ups, and he said, âNo.â Iâd say, âIâve just started in this business, I need a favor,â and he said, âYes.â But when the time came to interview them, he said, âGet the hell out of here, get away from my players, donât bother the warm-ups.â Q. Do you miss calling games? A. Iâd still like to be working. My health couldnât be better. The liver transplant worked. I still take a lot of anti-rejection pills every day. I go back to the Mayo Clinic every year. Q. What do you do on Sundays now? A. I watch the Cowboys if theyâre on. I watch the Giants if theyâre no. Iâm a fan.
