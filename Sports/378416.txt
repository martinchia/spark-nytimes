Advertisement  AP The National Football League will examine the financial structure of the San Francisco 49ers at a hearing in mid-June to determine if the structure gives the 1990 Super Bowl champions an unfair edge. No specific hearing date has been set. In 1988, the team became a subsidiary of the DeBartolo Corporation, which also owns shopping malls and race tracks and has other real-estate interests. There has been a question of whether the corporation gives the 49ers a financial advantage over other teams in signing players. Paul Tagliabue, the N.F.L. commissioner said his personal opinion was that ''it's doubtful that it does.'' Speaking of the subsidiary arrangement, Tagliabue said: ''It wasn't formed until Sept. 30, 1988, and that was after the 49ers had won two Super Bowls with a quarterback named Joe Montana and a coach named Bill Walsh. I'm skeptical that it has produced a competitive advantage to the 49ers.'' Tagliabue spoke at a meeting today of team owners, who were concluding their annual spring business meeting here. But the hearing will still be held, because of concerns by some owners. ''The league put in a policy many years ago that an N.F.L. team should be owned only by companies in football,'' Tagliabue said. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
