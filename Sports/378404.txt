Advertisement  A former minor league pitcher of no great distinction is about to make a mark as the first Japanese manager of an American baseball team. His name is Hide Koga and he is the new skipper of the Salinas Spurs of the Class A California League, a team that will have at least a dozen Japanese players on its roster when it plays the season opener Friday against the Modesto A's. ''What I will teach the young players is to think for themselves like American players,'' Koga said of the Japanese players on the team. ''I am going to teach the American players it takes hard work, long hours of practice to be a good player.'' Koga, who played in the San Francisco Giants' and Chicago Cubs' organizations at the Class A level, doesn't want to overtax the American players. The Americans are used to practicing just a couple of hours a day instead of the six or seven that Japanese players work. ''I am going to treat American players better than Japanese players,'' Koga said. Joe Buzas, the Spurs' co-owner, said he thought it would be a novel idea to sign the 50-year-old Koga, who has held front-office jobs with the Daiei Hawks of Japan for the last 20 years. ''He's a very articulate man and he does know what he's doing,'' Buzas said. ''If he doesn't, we'll get rid of him. He wants to blend the American style with the Japanese style to get the best of both.''(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
