Wednesday morning musings from the Petri dish of the preposterous: The techies at EnGadget.com discovered that while Cowboys Stadium may have been freezing cold on Media Day, it was still one of the hottest hotspots around. âThe stadium has right around 884 wireless access points installed, with each one tuned to provide coverage to roughly 250 seats.â Thatâs enough WiFi to keep Cowboys fans from getting bored during blowouts, though you have to wonder if the signal was strong enough to affect Tony Romoâs pass trajectories or Wade Phillipsâ brainwaves. The gadget gurus also asked Packers center Scott Wells his teamâs position on the iPhone-versus-Android debate. âItâs probably split,â Wells said. Which smart phone has the best âTeam Photoâ application? Next question! The EA Sports video game gurus simulated Sundayâs Super Bowl using their Madden 11 video game. The result? Steelers 24, Packers 20, with receiver Mike Wallace providing the late-game heroics for the Steelers. The Madden video game franchise has accurately predicted the results of every Super Bowl since 2004. Video game developers also determined that the medal leaders in the 2012 Summer Olympics will be an Italian plumber, a blue hedgehog, and a gorilla with a necktie.

The Madden franchise gets more realistic every year, and next year the developers should add a Media Day simulator to the game. Before playing the Super Bowl, the gamer must endure an hour of interviews conducted via multiple-choice dialogue trees: âQuestion: Do you feel that the mediaâs reaction to your response to your opponentâs Twitter comments regarding your coachâs press conference statements about your teamâs success has become a distraction to your teammates?
A-Button: No, we shut that stuff out and try to concentrate on what it takes to win.
L-Trigger: Iâm here to talk about football. Next question.
Down-Arrow: What?
Unlocked Cheat Code: Expletive-filled Jets-style response.â The Independent, a United Kingdom newspaper, published a list of the film previews scheduled to run during the Super Bowl. Pirates of the Caribbean IV, Thor, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Captain America: The First Avenger, and Cowboys & Aliens are among the blockbusters vying for attention. Parents may want to start manufacturing excuses to not take their children to these movies now (though I may be first in line and dressed as Loki for Thor).  The producers of the Justin Bieber movie Never Say Never opted to wait until the special episode of âGleeâ that will air after the Super Bowl, at least two hours after the average Bieber fanâs bedtime. And finally, can you dance like B.J. Raji? No? Well neither can his teammates.  The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
