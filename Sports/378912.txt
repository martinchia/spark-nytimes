 An exercise rider died after he was crushed by a thoroughbred at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto. The rider, Mourad Boudraa, 40, was riding about 6 a.m. when the horse went into an “unexplained wild gallop,” showing signs of medical distress, the police said. Boudraa was jammed into the track railing by the horse as it collapsed. Woodbine officials suspect the horse, Tawney’s Wish, died of a heart attack. ■ Keeneland in Lexington, Ky., will host its first Breeders’ Cup in October 2015.
