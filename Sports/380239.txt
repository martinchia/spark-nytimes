NO. 6 OREGON AT NO. 3 STANFORD
8 p.m., ABC Oregon brings its no-huddle, high-speed offense to Palo Alto, where Stanford will counter with Andrew Luck, the Heisman front-runner. Oregon relies on one of the most dangerous running backs in college football, LaMichael James, right, and the Ducks average just under 300 yards a game on the ground, good for fifth in the nation. Stanfordâs defense has been great against the run, allowing 79 yards per game, tied with Florida State for third nationally. Yet it is so tough to stop Oregon that Stanfordâs best bet may be to just try and keep up. Luck is the star, but the Cardinal are balanced on offense because of a stellar line and the running of Stepfan Taylor. This game is a chance for Stanford to make a statement. NO. 19 NEBRASKA AT NO. 12 PENN STATE
Noon, ESPN It is hard to focus on anything in college football except the shocking sexual abuse scandal that has gripped Penn State over the last week. After the firing of Joe Paterno on Wednesday night, Tom Bradley has taken over as head coach on an interim basis. He will be the first new coach at Penn State since 1966 and his first game will be on Senior Day with the university, to say nothing of the program, in turmoil. This game seems sure to have an unavoidably surreal atmosphere.  TEXAS CHRISTIAN AT NO. 5 BOISE STATE
3:30 p.m., Versus T.C.U. and Boise State meet for the first and only time as conference rivals; the Horned Frogs are leaving the Mountain West for the Big 12 next season. Fittingly, the winner will have a clear path to the conference title. The Broncos are undefeated but need a lot to go right for them to get to the Bowl Championship Series title game. A loss to the Horned Frogs would knock them out of contention in a hurry. NO. 24 AUBURN AT NO. 14 GEORGIA
3:30 p.m., CBS Georgia is in control in the Southeastern Conferenceâs East Division but cannot afford a loss.  NO. 2 OKLAHOMA STATE AT TEXAS TECH
Noon, ABC Oklahoma State needed a goal-line stand last week to fend off Kansas State. The Cowboys are terrible on defense â ranked 110th in the nation â but make up for it by scoring a lot of points. Texas Tech upset Oklahoma on Oct. 22 but has struggled since. WAKE FOREST AT NO. 9 CLEMSON
Noon, ESPNU First place in the Atlantic Coast Conferenceâs Atlantic Division is at stake. Clemson would clinch the title with a victory.
