Advertisement  The fight is between heavyweights MICHAEL MOORER and BERT COOPER. The battle is for future considerations in the heavyweight title picture. Sure, there is a title at stake tonight -- the World Boxing Organization's vacant heavyweight crown. But in today's market, W.B.O. titles are deflated, and the winner of the 12-round Moorer-Cooper match at the Taj Mahal in Atlantic City will hardly be considered the heavyweight king. The undisputed heavyweight champion is EVANDER HOLYFIELD, whose next title defense is June 19 against LARRY HOLMES in Las Vegas, Nev. But a strong performance in tonight's pay-per-view match would enhance the reputation of the winner and possibly validate him for a title challenge next year. The 26-year-old Cooper is 27-8 with 24 knockouts, including a loss to Holyfield in the seventh round last November. Moorer is 28-0 with 26 knockouts, the biggest one being against ALEX STEWART in the fourth round last July. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
