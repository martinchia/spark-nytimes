Advertisement  BOXING Lewis Stops Dixon  Lennox Lewis of England tuned up for his Oct. 31 heavyweight world-title elimination bout with Razor Ruddock by stopping Mike Dixon of Atlanta last night at 1:02 of the fourth round at Harrah's Casino Hotel in Atlantic City. The fight was halted after Dixon was wobbling following a standing 8-count. Lewis (21-0) will fight Ruddock in London. That winner is to fight next spring against the winner of the Nov. 13 title bout between champion Evander Holyfield and Riddick Bowe. (AP) TRACK AND FIELD Lewis and Bubka Win  Carl Lewis returned to the individual sprints yesterday, winning the 100 meters in the Monte Carlo Grand Prix track meet. Sergei Bubka of Ukraine, who was a flop in the Olympics, won the pole vault at 19 feet 4 1/4 inches, but failed in three attempts at a world-record height of 20-1. Maxim Tarasov, the Olympic champion, tied for seventh at 18-4 1/2. Lewis raced away in the last 40 meters to win in 10.15 seconds. Vitaly Savin of the Commonwealth of Independent States was second in 10.21 and Dennis Mitchell, the Olympic bronze medalist behind Linford Christie of Britain, was third in 10.28. Christie bypassed this meet. Nourredine Morceli of Algeria, the world 1,500-meters champion, rebounded from his poor performance in the Olympics to turn in the fastest time of the year in the metric mile, 3 minutes 32.75 seconds. Kevin Young, who broke Edwin Moses's 400-hurdles world mark last week with an effort of 46.78 seconds at Barcelona, won in 47.60 last night.
