Unable to right his foundering ship, Claudio Ranieri resigned as Roma’s coach on Sunday after the team blew a three-goal lead in a 4-3 loss to Genoa in Serie A. His decision capped a lightning-fast journey from optimism to resignation. Let’s recap, in his own words. Ranieri last Sunday, after a 2-0 loss to Napoli: “I donât think a single game can cancel out a year and a half of work.” Ranieri on Tuesday, before his team played Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League: “I asked my players that if I was the problem then I would leave but they said no. We want to fight and we will do so until the end.” Ranieri on Wednesday, after a 3-2 defeat against Shakhtar brought new questions about whether he would resign: “No, I’m not even thinking of it.” Ranieri on Sunday, after Roma’s loss to Genoa: “After a game such as today’s I believe it’s right to give a signal. After the final whistle I went into the changing rooms to thank the team and I decided to hand in my resignation.” Corner Kick: When does Carlo Ancelotti’s phone start ringing? Is this a face-saving opportunity that both he and the Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, can embrace?
