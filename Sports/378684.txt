 If Ryan Callahan’s grandmother stole the first episode of HBOâs â24/7: Road to the N.H.L. Winter Classic,â a younger generation stole the second. First, Rangers defenseman Dan Girardi’s toddler son, Landon, was shown hitting one-timers into a miniature net, fed by his father, at the family’s West Side apartment. The scene provides a glimpse into what players and their families go through during a long and grinding season that includes 41 road games. Landon and Girardi’s wife, Pam, wave goodbye as he leaves on yet another trip. The Flyers star forward Daniel Briere, a divorced father of four, took in his 19-year-old teammate, Sean Couturier, who played on the same junior team as Briere and in the same league as Claude Giroux, who previously stayed with Briere. The players were able to learn from a veteran, and also play video games with his kids. Briere quips that Couturier is actually closer in age to his boys than himself. Later, viewers learned about the relationship between Rangers Coach John Tortorella and the superfan Liam Traynor of Blauvelt, N.Y. Traynor, who has cerebral palsy, met Tortorella through the Garden of Dreams Foundation, and the pair keep in touch through text messages and phone calls. Tortorella keeps Traynor abreast of the team — “what I can tell him, anyway” — and even coaches Traynor through his rehabilitation, when he gets “lazy.” Traynor received an early Christmas present from the team — tickets to attend the Jan. 2 Winter Classic. Viewers again saw the softer side of Tortorella, who continues to be a bright spot in the show. His film session, in which he emphasized the importance of being consistent and playing a full 60 minutes, gave a glimpse inside his impressive hockey mind. Here’s hoping we see even more of the coach as the series goes on — is a look inside his house and his family life too much to hope for? Flyers Coach Peter Laviolette, on the other hand, was the coach who argued with the referees, calling the penalties on his team against the Canadiens “Montreal typical.” He said HBO has put a target on his team’s back. Despite the frustration, however, the Flyers managed to beat the Canadiens for their seventh victory in a row, their longest winning streak in almost a decade.  Music was woven throughout the episode (select tunes above and below), from Henrik Lundqvist’s jam session with the tennis superstar John McEnroe to little Landon carrying around his guitar to the game montage set to REO Speedwagon’s “Roll With the Changes.” Ilya Bryzgalov, now known by his Flyers teammates as Universe after his ramblings in Episode 1, continued to entertain. “Your lecture on the galaxy was …” forward Harry Zolnierczyk trails off. “Epic?” Bryzgalov asks in his thick Russian accent.  Continuing to highlight the little-known aspects of the game, HBO followed Acacio Marques, who has one of the toughest jobs in the N.H.L. as the equipment manager for the Rangers. Equipment managers go unnoticed by almost everyone but the players. The players appreciate their effort and usually pass along a token of their appreciation around this time of year. Later, Brian Boyle and Brandon Prust were shown napping before a game, a common practice among hockey players. Concussions continue to be an issue for both teams. Marc Staal, still battling a concussion he sustained in February on a hit from his brother Eric, was shown practicing in a yellow non-contact jersey with the Rangers. Philadelphia learns that the captain Chris Pronger will miss the rest of the season because of severe post-concussion symptoms. The Flyers will be hard-pressed to replace his experience, toughness and leadership on defense. But there was good news around the corner as Giroux, the league’s top points scorer, passed his concussion test. The team doctor asked him if he has trouble texting. No doubt Mark Messier was never asked that during his career. If anything, the series shows that injuries are a part of the game, no matter how many changes are made. Steve Eminger separated his right shoulder against the Coyotes in a 3-2 victory Saturday. In the same game, Ruslan Fedotenko had his face stitched up and went back in to play. The Rangers have lost 92 total man-games to injuries or illness this season. Against the Bruins on Saturday, when the Flyers’ streak ended with a 6-0 rout, Sean Couturier was nailed behind the ear with a flying puck. After Brad Richards scored the game-winner with one second left against the Coyotes, he was passed the Rangers’ lucky Broadway hat. The moment was camera-ready for HBO, which is painting the Rangers as part of the New York elite, with their fancy cars and impeccable suits, and the Flyers as the blue-collar, everyman team. It’s riveting television.
