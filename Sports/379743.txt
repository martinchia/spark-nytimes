Advertisement By BARBARA LLOYD The device, called a DataScope, is four and a half inches long. It was developed by Martin Kits van Heyningen, president of K.V.H. Industries of Middletown, R.I. The device operates on three lithium batteries. The DataScope has a single eyepiece, a 5 x 30 power monocular. Its compass, a digital style driven by a microprocessor, can store nine compass bearings in memory for use later, when you are plotting your course on a map. The range-finder mode allows you to estimate where you are, or how far you are from a distant object. The Datascope also has a quartz crystal clock, which can compute the time differences between bearings you have taken with the compass. The suggested price is $445. The device is sold in marine and sporting-goods stores. For information, telephone K.V.H. at (401) 847-3327. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
