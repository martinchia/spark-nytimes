MASON, Ohio â Andy Roddick hit a tennis ball into the stands, something he had done hundreds of times after victories. The only problem was that his first-round match Monday night against Phillip Kohlschreiber at the Western & Southern Open was far from over.     Roddickâs foul ball, struck in frustration after he double-faulted to give Kohlschreiber a break point early in the third set, constituted ball abuse. Because he had already received a warning for racket abuse, Roddick was assessed a point penalty, which handed Kohlschreiber the break and a 2-0 lead in the decisive set of his 6-7 (5), 7-5, 6-1 victory.     After receiving the point penalty, Roddick expended as much energy jawing with the chair umpire during the ensuing changeovers as he did chasing down Kohlschreiberâs ground strokes.      âI canât blame him,â Roddick said, âbut Iâm sitting here turning a six-week injury into a three-week injury, rehabbing eight hours a day, and with a split-second decision he interjects himself and itâs done. Itâs so frustrating. I certainly accept what I did. I put him in a bad situation out there.â        It was the third consecutive first-round exit in a Masters event for Roddick, who hadnât played in an ATP Tour event since Wimbledon because of an abdominal injury. He missed the French Open with a shoulder injury.     âIâve gotten hurt a couple times in training this year, which is tough, because if you come back, youâre out of shape and you donât feel like youâre where you need to be,” he said. “You push; you get hurt.â He added, âI need to find a way to taper that off a little bit so Iâm not hurting myself in training like I have a lot this year.â     Roddick, a two-time champion here, will fall out of the world top-20 next week for the first time since 2001. Asked if that bothered him, he replied, âIt would bother me if I felt like everything was where I wanted it to be and these results were coming.â     He added, âIf I play well and get a good stretch of two, three months, the ranking takes care of itself.â    Roddick, 28, said he would play at a Tour event in North Carolina next week to get more matches in before the Aug. 29 start of the United States Open. He won the Open in 2003, which felt like forever ago as he sat and dissected this latest setback.       The most frustrating thing, he added, is not being able to string points and games and matches together.       âItâs just playing the points at the right time and getting in a groove where you can play and youâre not thinking about it because you have five, six matches behind you and it becomes second nature,â he said.
