Advertisement  "Pay me or trade me. Click." That, more or less, was the entire contribution of defensive back TERRELL BUCKLEY to a conference call on Friday he had requested involving himself, his agent, CARL POSTON, and RON WOLF, the general manager of the Green Bay Packers, the team that made the former Florida State star the No. 5 pick in the April draft. After Buckley abruptly hung up without listening to Wolf's reply to his demand for either a huge salary or a trade, both Wolf and Poston were nonplussed. "It was a little bit of a surprise to all of us," said Poston, who found an explanation for his client's rudeness. "He wanted to indicate his seriousness," Poston said. "I think he did." Wolf indicated that he had not taken offense.  Given Buckley's negotiating technique, not to mention his demand for a salary averaging $2.1 million a year, well above the $1.5 million a year the No. 3 pick, defensive back SEAN GILBERT, is getting from the Rams, it is not clear that any other team would be interested in him.
