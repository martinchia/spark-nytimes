Throughout the college hockey season, Slap Shot will feature reports about some of the country’s top-ranked teams. Every sports team is going to hit a few bumps in the road during the course of a long season. For the University of Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs, the challenge is going to be to keep the wheels from falling off the bus. UMD was stunned by Michigan Tech last weekend at Amsoil Arena in Duluth, skating to a tie and a loss after scoring the first four goals of the series and allowing the final nine. âItâs embarrassing. Thereâs not much else to say,â Coach Scott Sandelin said. âWhen you canât put forth the effort and get outworked for 60 minutes, itâs unacceptable.â The weekend started off as a promising one for the Bulldogs, as they quickly jumped ahead in Fridayâs game, scoring four goals in the first period. Freshman winger Caleb Herbert tallied two of those goals and assisted on another. After playing one solid period, UMD struggled to keep up with MTU the rest of the way. The Huskies got their first goal of the game just 41 seconds into the second period. The score held steady at 4-1 until the Huskies exploded for three goals early in the third, one even-strength, one shorthanded and one on the power play. The Bulldogs survived several late scoring chances from the Huskies and escaped with a tie and one point in the W.C.H.A. standings. After outshooting MTU 14-8 in the first period, UMD was outshot 31-23 the rest of the way. âYou can kind of feel it in the locker room when it starts to go wrong,â freshman defenseman Chris Casto said. âIt starts getting quiet; the guys arenât having much fun. You can definitely tell.â Sandelin changed wingers on all four lines Saturday, hoping to get some rhythm back on offense. It didnât work. This time it was the Huskies who led 4-0 after the first. Led by senior goalie Josh Robinson, they went on to defeat the Bulldogs 5-0, handing them their first W.C.H.A. shutout loss in 105 games. UMD senior goalie Kenny Reiter was replaced in net by senior Aaron Crandall after the first period, the first time Reiter was unable to complete a game in his 24 starts this season. Senior captain Jack Connolly’s streak of 22 straight games with a point, which was tied with Mark Pavelich for the school record, came to an end Friday. âWe straight up got outworked and itâs unacceptable here,â senior defenseman Brady Lamb said after Saturdayâs game. âWe didnât play good hockey the last two periods last night and it carried over. We needed to come back with a better effort and it just didnât happen tonight.â UMD now sits second in the W.C.H.A. standings, five points behind Minnesota. Despite the poor performance in the two games, UMD held onto the No. 1 overall ranking in the U.S. College Hockey Online poll for the eighth consecutive week. However, they were overtaken by Minnesota in the USA Today/USA Hockey poll. The PairWise Rankings still project UMD to be the No. 1 overall seed in the N.C.A.A. Tournament, which beings in March. If they want to remain in consideration as one of the strongest teams in the country, the Bulldogs are going to have to bounce back this weekend. Theyâll be dealing with jet lag and late start times as they head off to play a pair of games against Alaska-Anchorage, who they swept at Amsoil Arena earlier this year. âWeâll put forth some effort in the next few days of practice,â Sandelin said. âWeâll get some things straightened out, get our heads screwed on. Itâll be a good test for our team.â Tom Olsen is a sports reporter for The Statesman at the University of Minnesota Duluth.
