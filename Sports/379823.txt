THE PLAY: North Carolina, with eight seconds left in a tie game, had the ball out of bounds under Oklahomas basket. Hubert Davis received the pass on the wing and dribbled to the free-throw line, drawing Rick Foxs defender toward him. Davis passed to Fox, who faked, drove and banked in a short runner as time ran out. THE PLAN: Today, Dean Smith, the former U.N.C. coach, insists that his teams execution wasnt up to par  sloppy screens, ill-timed shot  but its hard to fault a virtually uncontested three-footer. The play unfolded mostly as intended: Pete Chilcutt screened for Davis, Kevin Madden screened for Chilcutt and then both players crashed the boards; Davis drew the defense, which in end-of-game situations tends to drift toward the ball, and Fox got a good look going to the basket  though Smith wanted the shot taken earlier, to allow for a possible rebound. This was not the sort of play drawn up on the fly. Last-second plays, Smith says, are set up long before, in the summer, when Im at the beach.  CreditIllustration by Mckibillo 1 of 6
