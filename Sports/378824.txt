Brandon Jacobs went up to the Giants’ new tight end, Jake Ballard, on the sideline two weeks ago, seeking him out to offer a confession. âIâll be honest,â Jacobs said to Ballard. âI thought we needed a tight end. But youâre proving me wrong, week to week. Keep doing it.â In relating the story after Sundayâs victory over the Buffalo Bills, Ballard smiled. He knew that Jacobs was not the only one who had concerns about how the Giants would fill the void left by their former tight end Kevin Boss.  âI would have wondered, too,â Ballard said.  But Ballard has quickly shown that he can be more than the âblocking tight endâ he was at Ohio State. He caught all five passes thrown his way Sunday — two more than he caught in any one game in college, he said — and has recorded 273 receiving yards in six games. He has also scored two touchdowns, including one in the loss to the Seattle Seahawks which prompted Jacobs to offer his mea culpa. âHe doesnât have the great speed, but he just has a great feel for what to do,â Eli Manning said of Ballard. âYou can see it on a few of the plays today. Itâs not exactly how they were scripted, but he scrambles around. He has a feel for whatâs going on. Heâs catching the ball well and playing smart football.â So where did you fall on Ballard? Did you believe he could replace Boss or do you owe him an apology like Jacobs?  The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
