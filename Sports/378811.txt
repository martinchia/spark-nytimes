ARLINGTON, Tex. â Now batting third for the Detroit Tigers and playing left field … Delmon Young? Young was supposedly sidelined with an injured oblique muscle for the A.L. championship series against the Texas Rangers. He didnât play in the Tigersâ Game 1 loss Saturday, but after right fielder Magglio Ordonez’s surgically repaired right ankle was found to be fractured again Sunday, Manager Jim Leyland was told Young could go in Game 2. âItâs not really the oblique oblique.â Leyland said. âItâs one they didnât think was real serious to start with, but they didnât want to take any chances. …We were going to wait. It was kind of going to be an N.F.L.-like thing, a game-time decision. Heâs fine. Heâs swinging good.â Weâll find out soon enough how effective Young can be at the plate and defensively. Leyland said Young didnât swing a bat Sunday, but exercised and was examined by doctors and cleared to play. The Tigers were able to reactivate Young, who batted .316 and hit three home runs in the division series against the Yankees, because Ordonez was injured.  Youngâs return gives the Tigers a right-handed bat to replace the right-handed-hitting Ordonez against the Texas left-handed starter Derek Holland. Ryan Raburn replaced Ordonez in right field and was sixth in the Tigers’ order.
