Advertisement By CHARLIE NOBLES and  Stung by a poor performance in its first meeting with the Jets this season, the Miami Dolphins' defense plans to smother Jets' quarterback Boomer Esiason when the two teams meet Sunday in the Meadowlands. "When they play-actioned in the last game, Boomer had a lot of time to throw," free safety Louis Oliver said today, referring to New York's 24-14 victory Sept. 12. "This time, we're gonna have guys in his face all day long. Count on it. We're gonna be challenging every single series to come up with the plays. You won't see the same team you saw in that last game." The Dolphins have won five straight since the loss to the Jets, and in only one of those games has the opponent scored more than 14 points. "We're a much better team now from the team that played them in the second game," Oliver said. "So the defense in particular is really looking forward to going up there and redeeming ourselves, going out and showing everybody that we are a pretty good defense and that we can beat the Jets. We're embarrassed about what happened." Advertisement Jets safety Ronnie Lott said early in the week that what he liked most about Miami's defense is its nastiness. Pro Bowl linebacker Bryan Cox is usually the guy who sets that tone. Advertisement "When you see him go off, the rest of us feed off that," defensive end Marco Coleman said of Cox. "If Bryan's getting crazy, we get crazy with him." This is a defense playing with some swagger these days, headed by Cox and Oliver. They prance, they fist-wave, they hit people with zeal and viciousness. "We take the attitude that, hey, you've got to beat us," Oliver said. "We're coming at you intending to dominate you." Cox doesn't view Sunday's game as a chance for revenge. "When someone is looking for revenge, it always seems like they're reaching," he said. "We just all remember we got our butts kicked up and down the field the last time. We think we're gonna come out and play much better, and play truer to form. It'll be emotional, is all I can say."                    --------------------       More of Murrell? HEMPSTEAD, I.I., Oct. 5 (Special to The New York Times) -- Through the heavy rain drops at Jets practice today, it became clear that Boomer Esiason was handing the football more often than usual to Adrian Murrell, the seldom-used running back in his rookie season out of West Virginia.

Blair Thomas is questionable (hamstring) for Sunday's contest against the Miami Dolphins. Backup Johnny Johnson will start but has a twisted right knee, and rookie Richie Anderson (hamstring) is listed as probable. So Murrell's big chance could arrive sooner than expected. "Those guys looked a little bit tender today," Murrell said of his fellow running backs after practice. "If I get in there Sunday, it will be my chance to show the fans in New York and my teammates what I'm capable of doing." Murrell, a 5-foot-11-inch, 205-pound speedster, has just 15 carries this season for 79 yards. Despite the limited playing time, Murrell has shown flashes of his smooth, cut-back style of running. In the Jets' 45-7 rout of New England Sept. 26, he broke loose for a 37-yard touchdown run, the Jets' longest touchdown run from scrimmage this season. "If I get in there, my goal will not be to just fill in and keep the running game going, but to make something happen," said Murrell. "Sure, this is my rookie season, and the Jets have taught me so much more than I ever learned in college. But I'm not going to sell myself short. I know that if I'm called on, I can do the job." Advertisement Jets Coach Bruce Coslet, who expressed his displeasure today with having to answer questions about injuries to certain players -- "I'm not a doctor," he insisted -- evaluated Murrell's ability and potential with high praise. "We've been featuring him a little more each week and he's been doing well," Coslet said of Murrell, who runs the 40 in 4.4 seconds. "He keeps getting better. He's been learning all the nuances of what we want him to do." "He brings that extra dimension of speed into every game," said Coslet. "That makes him intriguing to me."
