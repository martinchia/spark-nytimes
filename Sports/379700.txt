During the second intermission of the Islanders-Montreal game, TSN’s Darren Dreger reported that he had surveyed N.H.L. coaches on whether they’d like to see a challenge system instituted in the league, much like the N.F.L.’s, where head coaches can request a review of an official’s decision. (video and here on his blog). Dreger said 14 of the 21 he spoke with favored such a system and that Panthers General Manager Dale Tallon is considering proposing a coach’s challenge rule at the November general managers meeting. What got Tallon riled up was this play on Tuesday in Toronto when the Maple Leafs’ Colton Orr tackled Panthers goalie Scott Clemmensen, clearly interfering with him…  …and a subsequent shot by Tim Brent deflect off Orr’s skate into the goal.  Neither referee, Stephen Walkom nor Francis Charron, called Orr for a penalty and that goal turned out to be the game-winner. Goalie interference is not among the plays currently reviewable by the league’s video review system.
 (Blogging yesterday for The Miami Herald, George Richards quoted N.H.L. vice president of hockey operations Colin Campbell, who acknowledged the referees blew the call. Campbell said Walkom, the league’s former director of officiating who returned to the ice last season, was high in the zone and had his view of the play obstructed by players. Campbell didn’t provide an explanation for Charron, who was along the goal line and had a clear view, other than saying he’s “a rookie referee.”) Dreger reported that one of the coaches who supports a challenge suggested limiting it to one per team, with a deterrent such as loss of a time out or a two-minute penalty if the team loses the challenge.  Of the seven coaches who opposed a challenge, Dreger said one feared coaches would use a challenge to create an additional timeout. Another said the solution to the problem was better officiating. Colin Campbell told Dreger that the general managers have discussed this previously but rejected it because they wanted to keep the use of video review limited. (Campbell expressed his own opinion to George Edwards, saying, “Where do you stop, what do you allow them to challenge?”) After Dreger’s report, the NHL on TSN panel shared their thoughts (video) and generally agreed with introducing the concept of a challenge.  

Metro Report: Last Thursday, all three area teams won, which is something of a rarity. Last night, six days later, all three lost. The Devils were dumped by the Sharks, 5-2, in San Jose and are playing so poorly that Rich Chere in The Star Ledger writes, “It is now a legitimate question as to whether John MacLean will still be the Devilsâ head coach when they return from their western road trip.”  This one was over early, with three first-period goals by the Sharks. The Dany Heatley-Joe Thornton-Patrick Marleau Line ate the Devils alive. On the opening goal, once Ilya Kovalchuk couldn’t come up with Matt Taormina’s pass in the neutral zone…  …the Sharks swept into the Devils zone. Taormina buckled under the pressure from Marleau and Thornton blew the puck past Martin Brodeur, a shot that seemed stoppable. They came right back in on their next shift and as Heatley worked the puck behind the net, first Thornton then Marleau swept through…  …with Marleau picking it up for a wraparound (not an unfamiliar weakness for Brodeur). Before the period was over, those three took control again on a strong cycle and, with Brodeur down after getting tangled up with Thornton just outside the crease…   …Marleau threw the puck toward the goal and Thornton shoveled it over the line. Thornton added his third in the middle period when the puck took a crazy bounce and caught Brodeur far from the net. Marleau added one in the third, out-muscling Henrik Tallinder in front after getting a perfect pass from Thornton. It was very impressive stuff.  âThe way that line played against us it was like they were playing against kids,â Brodeur said. âThey were all over us. Itâs not fun. Some losses you say, âAlright, letâs move on from this one.â But the way we got beatâ¦ to get beat by one line there is no excuse. You canât go into a building and three guys take over a game like they did.â  Up in Montreal, the Islanders were out-skated by the Canadiens, losing 5-3, a scoreline that doesn’t reveal how much faster and more skilled the Habs were. The Islanders were chasing the game all night and only the strong play of James Wisniewski, who had a goal and two assists, made the final score seem respectable.  Perhaps it would have been different had John Tavares put the puck past Carey Price on this play in the game’s first couple of minutes…  …but Price made two quick leg saves and played a solid game again, keeping the Montreal fans on his side and the Canadiens on top of the Eastern Conference. The Islanders hurt themselves, allowing this shorthanded goal by Travis Moen…  …after Tomas Plekanec took the puck from Doug Weight on the point, rushed into the zone and fed a gorgeous pass to Moen who beat Wisniewski to the net. Then Plekanec got one of his own in the second period…  …when he skated unchecked into the slot, where five spread-out Islanders defenders were unable to reach him.  As well as Winiewski played, he was outplayed by the Habs young defender P.K. Subban, who made great plays both offensively and defensively, diving to block shots and passes and making headlong rushes that are not in the playbook of his defense-first coach, Jacques Martin. Mike Boone on The Montreal Gazette’s Habs Inside/Out calls him “a Human Highlight Reel” and “the best-looking young player the Canadiens have had in a long, long time. The only question is whether Jacques Martin can watch P.K. through 82 games without a cardiologist and a crash cart behind the bench.”   At Madison Square Garden, the Rangers fell to the Thrashers, 6-4 (Jeff Z. Klein’s Times story here, with an emphasis on the number of black players on Atlanta’s roster), despite this early goal by Ryan Callahan…  …off a nifty pass from Artem Anisimov. But Anisimov would take a puck off his ankle midway through the game (he is scheduled for a magnetic resonance imaging test today) and that broke up the Rangers young, productive first line. The Thrashers, meanwhile, took advantage of Rangers sloppy play to tie the game on this excellent Brian Little effort later in the first period…  when he beat Sean Avery and then Marc Staal to tie the game. The Thrashers built a 5-2 lead, the eventual game-winner coming on the power play by Dustin Byfuglien…  …ripping it past Martin Biron, who was on his knees as Byfuglien went high. Biron didn’t look strong last night and he’ll need better showings if the Rangers plan to give Henrik Lundqvist more rest this season. The Rangers tried to come back with two goals late in the third but this wasn’t the hard-working effort seen in their three previous games, all victories. They looked more like the disorganized group that surrendered 19 goals in their first four games. The next games for all three teams come Friday: the Devils are in Anaheim, the Rangers hosting Carolina and the Canadiens come to Long Island, and on the Islanders Web site, the start page cries “No Habs No! Show the Canadiens that this is Islanders Country” — a plea to their fans to buy tickets and counter the ubiquitous Montreal fans who take advantage of the half-filled Coliseum to loudly cheer their team in enemy territory.  Skating Around: Teemu Selanne scored on the power play last night in Anaheim’s 5-2 win over Dallas…  …his 800th point as a Duck and 611th career goal, which vaults him over Bobby Hull for 15th on the all-time list. Eric Stephens has the story in the Orange County Register. At the other end of N.H.L. careers, Capitals goalie Michal Neuvirth recorded his first career shutout (here’s Katie Carrera Washington Post story), a 3-0 blanking of the Hurricanes in which he stopped 29 shots, none bigger than this save on Eric Staal to keep the score 1-0 midway through the game:  Finally, on the Blackhawks’ Web site, Bob Verdi, the great Chicago writer, has news that Scotty Bowman will have his own space, called “Ask the Oracle,” on the team’s page. Here are three quotes Verdi got from Bowman: “The defensemen in the league now are almost rovers. Look at Duncan Keith and Brent Seabrook. They all skate so well now. The days of hiding a guy who canât skate, theyâre gone. Everybody is faster and bigger and itâs the same everywhere. I see a lot of junior and college hockey too. Itâs the same way down there.” Also: “I worry about the concussions. Most of the problems are along the boards. Years ago, there was some give in the glass. I remember when there was no glass. It was wire, chicken wire. Thereâs no give anymore. I donât know what you do about that.” And: “The officiating? Two referees now, and it seems to me sometimes they canât wait to blow the whistle. Canât wait to call a penalty. Just my opinion. You can write that.â   Slap Shot, the New York Times hockey blog, reports on the Rangers, the National Hockey League and anything that glides quickly across a frozen surface anywhere on the globe, from the snowy prairies of Saskatchewan to the frigid steppes of Russia and beyond, like, say, Phoenix.
