TAMPA, Fla. — The lone television in the Yankeesâ clubhouse was tuned Sunday morning to the MLB Network, which was showing a program that ranked the best second basemen in baseball. As No. 1 appeared on the screen, he also walked out of the food room. Robinson Cano took his physical exam early Sunday after mixing up the teamâs reporting dates, drawing some playful ribbing from Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez. âIt was a little scary,â Cano said, when asked about realizing his mistake. âI donât like to be late.â Cano was on time last season, when, after being bumped him to the No. 5 spot in the lineup, accepted the added run-producing responsibility by hitting .319 and setting career bests in home runs (29) and runs batted in (109). In the off-season, he trained with Francisco Cervelli and Eduardo Nunez in the Dominican Republic and also switched agents, leaving Bobby Barad for Scott Boras.   Set to make $10 million in 2011, Cano can become a free agent as soon as after this season, but only if the Yankees declined their $14 million option on him for 2012. The chances of that happening are between slim and none, and slim just left town.  The Yankees hold a $15 million option for him in 2013, when he figures to hit the free-agent market. Boras clients almost never sign long-term contract extensions — Carlos Gonzalez of Colorado is an exception — and the Yankeesâ policy is not to discuss them. Cano did not sound as if he would ask Boras to engage the Yankees about a long-term deal, anyway. âI would never do that,â Cano said. âIt has to be their decision. Iâm just here to focus on playing baseball.” The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
