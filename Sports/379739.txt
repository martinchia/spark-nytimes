Ahead of the World Cup last summer, we reported on the number of injuries — serious and niggling — that plagued players who endured scores of games during the long league and cup seasons in Europe.  Today, a full seven weeks before many European leagues will take a holiday break, fixture congestion has caught up with a number of players who will miss Champions League games this week. Cesc Fabregas is out for Arsenal in the Londoners’ match against Shakhtar Donetsk.  Fabregas, the Spanish midfielder who broke his leg in a Champions League match last season, threatening his World Cup, had a hamstring injury last year that was perhaps handled poorly. Manager Arsene Wenger doesn’t want to repeat that mistake: “Cesc will not travel,” he told the club’s Web site. “It’s a mixture of caution and his hamstring. We cannot take the gamble. He has a good chance to play on Sunday but tomorrow would be a risk.”  Another player whose injury woes carried over from last season into the World Cup and now into the current campaign will sit out for Manchester United, for undisclosed reasons.  Rio Ferdinand, who played a baker’s dozen of games last season and missed the entire tournament in South Africa, is ruled out for the team’s match against Bursaspor in Turkey. Perhaps recognizing the toll a long season can take on an aging centerback, Manager Sir Alex Ferguson is trying to decongest Ferdinand’s fixture list before it becomes too clogged. Ferguson is already without the aging but ever-effective Ryan Giggs and the battered (physically and in the news media) Wayne Rooney. Bayern Munich, last season’s Champions League runner-up, will go to Romania for a match against CFR Cluj without the injured defender Holger Badstuber, further depleting an undermanned squad. The core of the team that lost to Inter Milan in the final last May has been out with one problem or another.   Striker Ivica Olic is out with a knee injury that will require surgery, keeping him out six months. The veteran forward Miroslav Klose is out with a torn thigh muscle. Franck Ribery’s ankle ligaments haven’t sufficiently healed, and the French midfielder will need at least another two weeks to recover. Arjen Robben also hurt his thigh muscle, playing for the Netherlands in the World Cup, sparking a fight between club and country as to who is on the hook for the star wing’s medical problems. The increasingly strident dispute also includes controversy over injury to Bayern’s Dutch captain, Mark von Bommel. There is barely a team in the Champions League tournament with a fully healthy squad, and many teams will miss key players. AS Roma is almost as battered as Bayern. First, it was Rodrigo Taddei who went down.  The wing had a recurrence of a calf injury that he aggravated in his club’s Serie A match — a 0-0 draw with Parma —  two weeks ago. Then, late last week, David Pizarro picked up a thigh injury in training,  ruling him out of the Italians’ Group E match with FC Basel 1893 on Wednesday.  And most recently Matteo Brighi went down with — surprise — a thigh injury on the weekend against Lecce.  He is out three weeks. This all is compounded by the loss of Francesco Totti (shoulder injury for Champions League, red card suspension keeping him out of a Serie A derby with Lazio this weekend) and Philippe Mexes (flu-like symptoms and/or asthma, according to reports). Hapoel Tel Aviv will be without its striker Etey Shechter (hamstring) for the team’s clash on Tuesday with Schalke 04, who is without its German-American defensive midfielder, Jermaine Jones (ankle). Marseille, which faces MÅ K Å½ilina in Group F on Wednesday, will miss Ãdouard CissÃ© because of a hamstring injury he picked up in a League Cup game. (Seriously: league, cup, champions league … how many different competitions do these guys need to play?  Is it any wonder so many get hurt?  And now clubs will be forced to carry smaller rosters.)
