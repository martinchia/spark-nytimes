Advertisement  Center SCOTT HASTINGS has signed a one-year contract with the Denver Nuggets, leaving only the team's two first-round draft choices unsigned. Terms were not disclosed, but the deal is guaranteed. Hastings earned $500,000 last season. The 6-foot-11-inch Hastings, a veteran of 10 N.B.A. seasons who was used sparingly last season, was a free agent. He had contract discussions with several other teams before agreeing to stay in Denver. Two draft choices, ROBERT WERDANN and BRYANT STITH, are now the only unsigned Denver players.
