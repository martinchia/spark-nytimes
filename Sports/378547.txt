 What to watch for in Friday’s World Cup quarterfinals, featuring two European powers and an all-South America clash. France vs. Germany, noon: The German team was getting nothing but plaudits until it struggled to put away an overmatched Algerian squad in the Round of 16 and now it has injury worries. Defender Shkodran Mustafi was injured against Algeria and will miss the game and there are injury doubts about midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, who has arguably been the team’s best player. France, led by Karim Benzema and Olivier Giroud, seems to still be firing on all cylinders. The game will stir some to remember the epic between West Germany and France in the 1982 World Cup semifinals, when West Germany erased a 3-1 deficit to win, 5-4, in a penalty shootout. Germany’s goalie, Manuel Neuer, will not relish any comparisons to the West German goalie in that game, Toni Schumacher, who broke the jaw of France’s Patrick Battiston with a vicious feet-first tackle. Brazil vs. Colombia, 4 p.m.: This game should have the whole continent at a standstill, because Brazil, pretournament favorite as well as host, will face a formidable team from a country on its northern flank. While Brazil dominates rivalries with some of its South American opponents, it looked eminently beatable in its penalty shootout win over Chile — aside from an inspired showing by Neymar early and Hulk later in the game. Colombia has looked powerful throughout, led by James Rodríguez, who has five goals to lead the race for the Golden Boot. Look for him to test a not-always-cohesive Brazilian defense.
