 Our weekly analysis of the metropolitan area’s three N.H.L. teams: Grades Rangers: Until the last tenth of a second of the week, the Rangers played poorly. But Brad Richards flicked a backhand shot on Phoenix goaltender Mike Smith, and the puck caromed off a Coyotes defenseman and in the goal. After a few minutes of video replay by officials in Toronto, New York was awarded a goal at 19 minutes, 59 seconds of the third period, breaking a tie and giving the Rangers a 3-2 victory. After losses to Dallas and St. Louis, the Rangersâ week was saved and HBOâs â24/7â series had another unique moment to capture. The Rangers play three division rivals this week: the Devils, Islanders and Flyers. Grade: C Devils: New Jersey won all four of its games this week, starting with back-to-back road victories against the two Florida teams, followed by victories Friday at home over Dallas and Saturday in Montreal. The return of center Travis Zajac this weekend has the offense clicking; the Devils scored a combined 11 goals against the Stars and Canadiens. Zach Parise and Ilya Kovalchuk have found some chemistry, and rookie center Adam Henrique continues to produce almost every night. Grade: A Islanders: After losing four straight, the Islanders won 2-1 Saturday in a shootout victory in Minnesota,Â despite facing a Wild lineup missing four of its top six forwards. They lost Tuesday in Montreal and Thursday at home against Dallas. Jack Capuanoâs crew needs to start winning two of every three games to rejoin the playoff chase. This week they play Tuesday in Winnipeg, Thursday at the Garden against the Rangers and Friday at home against the struggling Maple Leafs. Grade: C-minus Metro Player of the Week
 Patrik Elias, Devils: Elias became the franchiseâs all-time leading goal scorer Saturday in grand style. He scored twice â the 356th and 357th goals of his career, all with New Jersey â in the Devilsâ 5-3 win in Montreal,Â surpassing Â John MacLean in the record books. After going without a goal in his previous 11 games, Elias scored four goals and had two assists last week. Proving he still has plenty to give, he leads the team in scoring with 13 goals and 29 points. Trending Up: The Devilsâ Front Office â For one night, the franchise that pushes the mantra âthe crest on the front is more important than the name on the backâÂ more than any N.H.L. team did the opposite for Scott Niedermayer. Franchise players like Niedermayer deserve it. His No. 27 was everywhere you looked on Friday — even on the press passes — when the Devils retired it. The ceremony was pitch-perfect, and then the current team pushed the puck down the ice like Niedermayer and beat Dallas, 6-3. Up: Kurtis Foster â Acquired Monday from Anaheim for Rod Pelley and Mark Fraser, the defenseman played an average of 20 minutes a game in three victories this week with his new team, the Devils. He had two assists in the win in Montreal and has been solid in the Devilsâ end. Down: Brian Boyle â You donât need to hear a miked-up John Tortorella yell at Boyle on HBO to know the big centerâs game has seen a drop-off this season. Itâs O.K. that he has only scored two goals; last yearâs total of 21 was an aberration for the grinding center. But whereâs the grind?

Up: Front-Running Rangers â The Rangers are 14-1-1 this season when they score the first goal of the game. Up: Michael Del Zotto â The concern with the third-year defenseman has never been his strong puck-moving skills, but his defense. This season,Â Del Zotto, 21, leads the Rangers at plus-15. He has 1 goal and 9 assists over his last 11 games and played more than 25 minutes Saturday in the win over the Coyotes. Up: Josh Bailey â After looking lost for most of the Islandersâ first 20 games this season, the third-line center has taken some baby steps in the last 10. A self-proclaimed playmaker and not a shooter, Bailey appears more confident with the puck and has been reliable on defense. HisÂ development is important for the Islanders, and he’s still just 22.
