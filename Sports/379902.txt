 For the first time in its history, Costa Rica will play in the quarterfinal of the World Cup after defeating a dour, defensive Greece team in a penalty shootout.  The Round of 16 match in Recife, Brazil, was tied 1-1 after regulation.  Greece scored a late goal in stoppage time to even the score.  Costa Rica was playing with only 10 men after one of its defenders, Oscar Duarte, was ejected in the 66th minute.  Duarte lunged at Greece's Jose Chovelas after Chovelas blew by Duarte.  The dangerous, cynical foul earned Duarte a yellow card, but it was his second of the match.  He was shown red and the referee sent him off.  Costa Rica, who was up by one goal at the time, was forced to play the rest of the game down a player.  There was little scoring and few promising opportunities for most of the game from two teams who advanced to the knockout round on the strength of their defenses.  And in the case of Costa Rica, its goalkeeper, Keylor Navas.  What looked to be the game's only goal was scored in the 52nd minute by Costa Rica's influential midfielder Bryan Ruiz. He strung a left-footed shot into the far right corner of the goal, placing his shot more than powering it, from the top of the box. It would take more than 40 more minutes for another ball to find the back of the net, an unlikely thought for most of the game.  Though Greece had more chances, some dangerous, Navas was stellar in stopping close-range shots, even when he faced an onslaught in the second half and the 30 minutes of extra time.  He could do little to stop the shot from Sokratis Papastathopoulos, after having already stopped Theofanis Gekas.  The rebound fell to the defender Papastathopoulos who slammed it into the back of the net.  What could have been truly demoralizing for Costa Rica, who has become the darling of this World Cup after beating Italy and Uruguay and tying England in the so-called group of death, was galvanizing.  They defended ably, if frantically, in the overtime period, lasting until the penalty shootout.   Next up for Costa Rica, who has never advanced this far before, is the Netherlands, who defeated Mexico earlier in the day. Full story Â»  Bryan Ruiz strings a left-footed shot from the top of the Greece penalty box along the turf and into the right corner of the goal to give Costa Rica a 1-0 lead over Greece.
   Greece, can you believe it?  This game is going to overtime. We have to actually watch 30 more minutes of this?  Greece, with a man advantage, finally finds a way to get a ball past Costa Rica goalkeeper Navas.  It’s Sokratis who nets it. And even the terrible games are crazy. — Andrew Keh (@andrewkeh) June 29, 2014     Costa Rica advances to the quarterfinal of the World Cup for the first time, beating Greece in a penalty shootout after a long, lackluster game.  The Ticos will meet the Netherlands in the next round.   Here are the penalty shootout results:
Costa Rica: Borges (goal), Ruiz (goal), Gonzalez (goal), Campbell (goal), UmaÃ±a (goal)
Greece: Mitroglou (goal), Lazaros (goal), Holebas (goal), Gekas (saved) Costa Rica goes to its first quarterfinal. Amazing. I would have predicted before the Cup that they would go winless in their group. — David Waldstein (@DavidWaldstein) June 29, 2014  Costa Rica is seen as a joyous, entertaining team that has enchanted crowds by winning the Group of Death over Uruguay, Italy and England. Greece is seen as a dour defensive team that scored just two goals in the group stage and spoiled the Ivory Coast's dream with a marginal last-minute penalty. Expect most neutral fans to have a strong rooting interest.   A berth in the quarterfinals against a more formidable opponent, Netherlands or Mexico.  Advertisement
