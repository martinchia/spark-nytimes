It used to bother Sergei Bubka, the tennis player and son of the legendary Ukrainian pole vaulter with the same name, when reporters would ask him about his father. âSometimes I just wanted to be left alone,â he said Tuesday after his first-round match at the United States Open. âEspecially after losing a match, sometimes people would come up to me and just start talking about it.â He explained how he would respond: âLike, I just lost in the first round. Leave me alone, please. Iâm just a regular guy.â On Tuesday, though, Bubka â whose facial features, especially his blue eyes, are remarkably similar to his fatherâs â finally had the chance to talk about the success of his match instead of just chatting about his father. A qualifier for the Open, Bubka, 24, beat Austriaâs Andreas Haider-Maurer, 6-3, 6-2, 3-6, 6-4, in his debut in a Grand Slam event. âFor sure, itâs the biggest achievement Iâve had in my career,â said Bubka, who is ranked 207th in the world and has good athletic genes. His mother, Lilia, was a competitive gymnast. His father, the Olympic gold medalist and six-time world champion in the pole vault, was not on hand to see his namesake win at the Open. As the vice president for the International Association of Athletics Federations, he was in South Korea for the world track and field championships, monitoring his sonâs progress on the Internet.  When they finally spoke by phone, the elder Bubka said he is happy that his son is improving and âfinally broke through to this step,â said the younger Bubka, whose parents steered him away from the pole vault when he was young so he wouldnât forever be compared to his father. Not that Bubka, who moved from Ukraine to Monaco when he was 7, knew how famous his father was anyway. The first time he figured it out, he said, was when he was 15 and had just lost in the first round of the Australian Open juniors tournament. So many reporters wanted to interview him about his father that his post-match news conference was moved to a room normally used for the biggest stars. Bubka said he was astounded by it. Now, though, he is on his way to making his own name and said he is proud of that. He said the best part of his game is his serve and that he hit a 156.60 mile-an-hour one at the Masters event in Montreal, but it was called out. âThat would have been the world record,â he said, smiling. âThat says a lot about my game. I have quite a big serve.â He added: â I just hope that I will continue improving and hope that I will be known as Sergei Bubka the tennis player, not Sergei Bubka the pole vaulter.â When asked if he ever plays tennis with his father â and how competitive those matches get â he said the two donât play very often because his father is too busy. When they do play, he said, they never keep score. Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
