Off the Dribble will highlight three essential games to watch each week, featuring hot teams, winning and losing streaks, and intriguing matchups in the N.B.A. (All times Eastern.) Los Angeles Lakers at Denver, 9 p.m. Monday As you might expect from a team based in Hollywood, the Lakers continue to demand attention. Through all the drama of their disappointing season, they have garnered an inordinate amount of coverage as the most frequently discussed team that has spent much of the season with a record under .500. The last time the Lakers reached that hallowed mark was against Portland on Dec. 28, after losing a tough one in Denver, 126-114.  The Nuggets are tough for the Lakers to beat for several reasons. They play with the second highest pace in the league, and their scoring comes from all over the floor. They have a dynamic point guard in Ty Lawson, who had 21 points and 10 assists in a victory over the Lakers on Jan. 7. And with players like JaVale McGee, Wilson Chandler and Andre Miller coming off the bench, the Nuggets have depth that the Lakers struggle to contend with. There have been a lot of points this season at which it appeared the Lakers would turn things around. They have won three straight, and if they manage to win in Denver you can expect people to start praising them again. Los Angeles Clippers at Indiana, 7 p.m. Thursday Though the Pacers are one of the best teams in the N.B.A., they can be tedious to watch. Their defense is so consistent that it produces few highlights from opposing offenses. Recently though, their offense has started to produce impressive numbers of its own. They won their last four games by a combined total of 108 points, including a big win over the Knicks and back-to-back routs of their division rivals, the Detroit Pistons. Things continue to look up for the Pacers offense with the return of Danny Granger, who made his season debut on Saturday against the Pistons.  At the same time, the other, better team in Los Angeles faces some questions. The Clippers have won five of their last six games, but the loss, a bad one to San Antonio, had people questioning whether the Clippers were tough enough to face the other top teams in the league at playoff time. They are also 0-2 against the Thunder this season. The Clippers have a knack for beating tough defensive teams. Though they have not played Indiana, they are 2-0 against Memphis, 2-1 against San Antonio and 2-0 against Chicago, which gives them a 6-1 record against the three best defensive teams in the league (measured by defensive efficiency), not including Indiana. Game of the Week: Miami at Knicks, 1 p.m. Sunday It is the time of year when fans can start speculating on potential playoff matchups, and Knicks fans should be excited and petrified about this one. Excited because it has been a long time since New York has fielded such a promising team, and petrified because the Heat look unstoppable. They have won 11 staight, their stars are playing like stars (Dwyane Wade had 15 points in the fourth quarter in Sundayâs win over Cleveland, for example) and supporting actors like Ray Allen are contributing in a major way. That said, the Knicks are 2-0 this season against the Heat, and New York won both games by 20 points. Both wins came under extraordinary circumstances: the first was played in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, when the Knicks played for a reeling city and Miami did not seem to have the heart to stop them. In the second, the Knicks made 18 3-pointers, winning without Carmelo Anthony on the Heatâs home floor. That second game took place in early December when the Knicks were still sitting atop the Eastern Conference. Miami has hit its stride since then, and the Heat will come to New York on Sunday feeling rested after a three-game homestand. Itâs unlikely the Knicks will get another 20-point win, but the way they play at Madison Square Garden on Sunday will help set the tone in April.
