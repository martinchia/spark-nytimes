Advertisement  The Atlanta Braves are putting their minds to continued success. The National League champions have hired JACK LLEWELLYN, a sports psychologist who worked with pitcher JOHN SMOLTZ last season. Smoltz started the season 2-11, then began sessions with Llewellyn and wound up 14-13. After the season, other major league clubs contacted Llewellyn and asked him to work with their players. Llewellyn met with Braves General Manager JOHN SCHUERHOLZ and agreed last week to begin an exclusive testing and counseling program for Braves players.
