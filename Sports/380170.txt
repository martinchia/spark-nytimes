Time to go to Google Earth, or those old school things calledÂ  world atlases. Can you find the city of Makhachkala on the map? It is the capital of the Russian republic of Dagestan, which the BBC tells us translates to land of the mountains. And these days the soccer club in the city, Anzhi Makhachkala, which wasÂ  founded in 1991, is becoming the land of the foreign imports. The latest European star to make the move to the east and to the Russian Premier League is Samuel Eto’o. On Tuesday, Internazionale of Italy reached an agreement to send Eto’o, the Cameroon international striker, to the club where he was expected to sign a three-year deal that could pay him about $29 million a year.   It would make him the highest paid soccer player in the world. Anzhi was bought last January by the Russian oil billionaire Suleiman Kerimov, who was No. 118 on Forbes magazine’s list of the world’s richest people. Since he purchased the team, Kerimov has added players like the Brazilians Roberto Carlos, JoÃ£o Carlos, Diego Tardelli and Jucilei, who, at 23, is much younger than the team’s other acquisitions and is rated as one of the top defensive midfielders in the world. And there are others. In all, Kerimov has forked over nearly $60 million in transfer fees since he bought the club, which is currently in fourth place in the Premier League, 9 points behind CSKA Moscow, after last week’s win against third-place Dynamo Moscow. Dagestan, a multiethnic republic that has been plagued by violence in recent years, is in the North Caucasus, a region that includes Chechnya, where Russian has long fought a war against separatists. The situation is bad enough in Makhachkala for the club’s players to live and train near Moscow and fly in for matches, a trek of about 1,000 miles, for its 15 home games. Eto’o, 30, has been a consistent goal-scorer wherever he has played during his career. Most recently at Inter Milan, he led the club with 37 goals in all competitions last year. In five years at Barcelona, Eto’o scored 108 goals in 145 appearances. He has also played 101 times for Cameroon. In recent years, Russian clubs have gone on a spending spree and produced competitive club teams in major European competitions (Zenit St. Petersburg, for one). In addition, the country late last year was awarded the 2018 World Cup (and will host the Winter Olympics in 2014). Is any player worth $29 million a year? Can Eto’o and his teammates succeed in this odd, and potentially dangerous, situation? Does Kerimov have designs of emulating his countryman Roman Abramovich at Chelsea or trying to duplicate the recent spending spree of Manchester City in England?
