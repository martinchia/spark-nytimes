A quick recap of the Jets’ 34-17 loss at Baltimore: 
KEY PERFORMANCE  Committing turnovers week after week is bound to have repercussions. Mark Sanchez committed four more Sunday night, running his total to nine. The Ravens scored 24 points off turnovers. Sanchez has big hands, and the Jets have worked with him on ball security. But he struggled to handle two snaps, which did not appear to be the fault of the backup center, Colin Baxter, who again started in place of Nick Mangold. NOTABLE NUMBER  It took one play for the Ravens to establish their superiority over the Jetsâ offensive line. When Ed Reed broke free and forced Sanchez to fumble, it set the tone for a night of dominance. Try as they might, the Jets could not find the suitable combinations to protect Sanchez and keep Baltimoreâs imposing front seven from breaching the line.
