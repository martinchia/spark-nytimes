Friendly Disclaimer: The following list is influenced largely -â but not strictly -â by film study of all 32 teams from the 2010 season. Stats werenât acknowledged, but players with poor numbers generally donât make top 10 lists anyway. Vague enough for you? Criteria for top 10 lists tend to be. Thatâs why most of you will have no trouble finding some disagreement with what youâre about to read.   (Last yearâs ranking in parentheses.)  10. Jonathan Stewart, Panthers (6) Not many runners possess his combination of power and finesse. (The finesse side of his game remains underrated.) 9. Michael Turner, Falcons (NR) Style of play suggests heâs bound to hit a wall soon, but weâll deal with that when it happens. Right now, he remains the best tackle-breaking bell cow in the N.F.C. 8. Steven Jackson, Rams (3) Wear and tear is taking a bit of a toll, but tenacity and wisdom are picking up enough of the slack (for now). 7. Ray Rice, Ravens (4) Struggled uncharacteristically at times in 2010, but not enough to make you lose appreciation for his lateral agility, vision, unassuming power and versatility. 6. Frank Gore, 49ers (8) The consummate downhill runner. Plays his heart out every Sunday, too. 5. Maurice Jones-Drew, Jaguars (5) The most difficult player in the league to tackle. Can also destroy opponents with his pass blocking and receiving. 4. Chris Johnson, Titans (1) A threat to score on every down, but must develop a greater appreciation for the 4-yard gain. 3. Arian Foster, Texans (NR) Perfect fit in Houstonâs runner-friendly zone-blocking scheme, though a player with his supple power and east-west explosiveness is a perfect fit in a lot of systems. 2. Jamaal Charles, Chiefs (NR) Record-setting 2010 numbers (6.4 yards per carry!) were a reflection of his playmaking prowess. Heâs Chris Johnson only with more run-to-run consistency. 1. Adrian Peterson, Vikings (2) Itâs somewhat of a shame that the most violent, explosive ballcarrier in the game (by far) has had to overcome shoddy blocking the past two years. On the cusp: Cedric Benson, Bengals; Rashard Mendenhall, Steelers; LeSean McCoy, Eagles; Danny Woodhead, Patriots; DeAngelo Williams, Panthers; Darren McFadden, Raiders Dropped from list:  Rashard Mendenhall, Steelers (10) DeAngelo Williams, Panthers (7) The drop of these two is simply a function of the breakout of Foster and Charles. Youngster that could burst onto next yearâs list: LeSean McCoy, Eagles The third-year pro runs with surprising elusiveness and is a major part of Phillyâs passing attack. Most encouraging is the improvement heâs shown from a mental standpoint. Andy Benoit is the founder of NFLTouchdown.com and covers the N.F.L. for CBSSports.com.
