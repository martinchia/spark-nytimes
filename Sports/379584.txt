Advertisement  AP Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Butch Reynolds led a group of stars in withdrawing from the USA/Mobil outdoor championships today. Greg Foster, Andre Phillips, Renaldo Nehemiah, Danny Harris, Antonio McKay and Roddie Haley were also among the late withdrawals. Joyner-Kersee, the 1988 Olympic champion in the women's long jump and heptathlon, pulled out of the 400-meter intermediate hurdles because of fatigue, said a spokesman at the office of her husband and coach, Bob Kersee. Foster, the two-time world champion and 1984 Olympic silver medalist in the men's 110-meter high hurdles, withdrew because of foot problems, the spokesman said. Kersee also coaches Foster. Reynolds, the world record-holder and the Olympic silver medalist in the men's 400 meters, withdrew from the 200, reportedly because of a hamstring injury. Phillips, the Olympic champion in the men's 400-meter intermediate hurdles, was entered in the hurdles and the flat 400 meters, but was reportedly suffering from a virus. No explanation was given for the absence of Harris, the 1984 Olympic silver medalist in the intermediate hurdles. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
