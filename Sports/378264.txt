Advertisement  They are the Super Bowl champions, after all, so it should be no surprise that members of the Giants family should receive an honor or two now and then. Last week it was the team's co-owner, WELLINGTON MARA, and newly designated starting quarterback, JEFF HOSTETLER, who were on the receiving list. Although it was a close call, Mara may have gotten the better of it. He received the 1991 Pete Rozelle Award, named for the former National Football League commissionr and given by the Touchdown Club of New Orleans for outstanding contributions to professional football and the N.F.L. Hostetler received a congratulatory telegram from West Virginia Governor GASTON CAPERTON, hailing him as "our JERRY WEST of football." It seems that Hostetler and the former Laker star are both natives of West Virginia. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
