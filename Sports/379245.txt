In a bucket-list moment, Julie June Stewart woke up at 4 a.m. and bought a ticket to the 2008 Belmont. She hasnât stopped going to the races since. That is when she isn’t isnât taking on a wildfire, hurricane, volcano or oil spill as the nationâs leading expert in disaster airspace coordination. It was 5:30 in the morning and even the cats didnât budge when the phone rang. Hello, the man said with enthusiasm. Kostas Hatzikoutelis is the ebullient vice president of Dream Team Racing Stable. His horse is the Derby hopeful Mucho Macho Man. Kostas can gracefully put more into a paragraph than most people think during an entire day. In a matter of seconds, I was totally swept into the Dream Team Racing Stable journey. I told him I was coming to the Louisiana Derby, and he offered to connect me with the Dream Team and Mucho Macho Manâs connections.  Within seconds, the phone rang and it was Dr. Jim Culver, President of Dream Team Racing Stable. He told me how they had purchased Mucho Macho Man as a yearling on the recommendation of the Ocala breeders John and Carole Rio. He said that portions of this journey are dreamlike. Mucho Macho Man was considered dead at birth and did not move for 10 minutes. He was named Lazarus when he sprang to life. The trainer, Kathy Ritvo, was a recent heart transplant patient. Culver himself had survived a heart attack.  Sometimes you meet a horse that you know is different.  When I met Mucho Macho Man, or 3M, I knew that he was a horse unlike others.  He is everything I like in a horse.  He is big, red and flashy, with a beautiful face, a strong personality and a swagger.  His coat is gorgeous in the sunshine.  He has an intelligent eye.  He has long legs like a giraffe and a big stride. This horse made me say, âWell, Hello thereâ and just stop and take him in.     Before any of us had arrived in New Orleans, Culver had driven for 10 hours arriving at Fair Grounds at 4 a.m.  Rather than heading to a hotel, he simply slept in his car. He did not want to miss 3Mâs arrival.   Part of being astute within the horse racing business is understanding when to sell or when to share.  Culver and Hatzikoutelis have participated in six syndications and did a lot of research on how to run a successful syndicate. After 3Mâs first race, they had 12 purchase offers but they wanted to stay with their horse. So Culver started working on a syndication deal.     Dean and Patti Reeves carry the aura of success.  This is obviously honed from years of work within their respective business worlds.  Dean is a tall, silver-haired gentleman straight from central casting.  He is now semi-retired from running his familyâs contracting and general construction company in Atlanta. Patti is as sharp as can be.  She runs Reeves Media, an outdoor advertising consulting business.   Their journey in horses brought them to the Derby in record time. It was simply meant to be. Dean was the under bidder for Big Brown (then known as Hip #21). They ended up purchasing a different horse and ended up running their first race at the Belmont. Several horses later, Dean was contacted by an agent to check out Gourmet Dinner. But it wasnât Gourmet Dinner who caught Deanâs eye.  It was the horse with the big stride who took second place. Dean couldnât stop thinking about him and knew he had to have him.  He contacted the Dream Team Racing Stable on the day they were going to finalize their new syndicate.  First of all, they had had numerous offers on 3M. They were looking at another business offer but Dean can be quite persuasive. In fact, what he said was, âI think you will like me a hell of a lot better than the other guys.â I think he was right.   With 70 percent of the ownership, Mucho Macho Man now races under Reeves Thoroughbred Racing silks. But the beautiful part of this Derby tale is that some of the original members of the Dream Team bought a single share for $800. With that share, they are part of the swirl of people surrounding the big red horse.  The Dream Team partners with 12 owners.   When I met 3Mâs trainer, Kathy Ritvo, I was impressed. When she stands next to 3M, she is as tiny as he is tall.  Kathy has that invested experience and depth of knowledge with 3M and the gift of graceful strength to chase people away from the barn when itâs time. This can be difficult when there are so many partners who each have an idea of what their experience with âtheirâ horse should be.   Ritvo applies her innate knowledge and experience to protecting, nurturing, and developing her boisterous 3-year-old colt.  Watching the two of them together, it is evident that they have quite a relationship.  She is part of the entire 3M inspirational story as she is indeed lucky to be alive after suffering from cardiomyopathy and having a heart transplant.     The Louisiana Derby was a lovely day of hats, fashion and manners with New Orleans flair. As the horse head ice sculpture in the Black Gold Suite melted drip by drip, the excitement of the Dream Team rose.  Hats and spring finery bedecked all of them. A daughter confided, âI get more nervous as each race goes by.â Their energy soars as they gather for a group picture. Mucho Macho Manâs coat glistened in the Louisiana sun and you knew it was going to be a great race.   It was a great race.  But it sure didnât turn out as expected. Pants on Fire, with Rosie Napravnik up,  won the Louisiana Derby as a longshot. And what was the outcome of the handsome red colt? The Reeves were standing with Ritvo when one of the gate crew came up and handed her 3Mâs shoe. He had left it at the gate. The Reeves, Ritvo and the Dream Team couldnât have been prouder of their guy.  He had managed third, and they were happy.  I asked Patti where she and Dean had watched the race from. She said that they prefer to buy grandstand tickets and sit with the fans anonymously. She said it was perfect because somehow by fate, they ended up in a pocket of people cheering on 3M.  I smiled when she told me this, because I wasnât sure if the Reeves, The Dream Team or Ritvo knew that their days of being anonymous within the horse racing world were over as the Kentucky Derby spotlight shines brighter and brighter.
Itâs only been a matter of weeks since the Louisiana Derby, but Ritvo is on the cover of Blood-Horse Magazine. The Thoroughbred Times announced the Derby wedding of two Dream Team partners on their front page. Culver and Dream Team members have been featured in numerous newspaper articles. Patti Reeves has made Mucho Macho Man a well-known figure in Atlanta with a billboard.  She even obtained sponsorship from 3M for Mucho Macho Man.  Mucho Macho Man has been declared by the media as The Story of this Kentucky Derby. And why not, it has an amazing cast of characters.
