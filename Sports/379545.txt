EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. â In what can only be thought of as stomach-churning news for the Giants, quarterback Eli Manning left practice early Wednesday because of illness. Coach Tom Coughlin described Manningâs ailment as a âstomach bugâ and did not seem overly concerned. Coughlin said it is âhopefully a 24-hour deal.â Manning is expected to play in Sundayâs N.F.C. championship game against San Francisco. Manningâs absence, however, left the backup quarterback David Carr with dual roles to fill; Carr normally directs the scout-team offense, in which he simulates the opposing teamâs quarterback and play-calls to help the Giantsâ defense prepare. But with Manning out, Carr also had to take snaps with the first-team offense. âI drank a lot of water out there,â Carr said afterward. While the Giants wouldÂ surely have preferred that Manning be able to take the practice snaps Wednesday, Carr said he had little concern that Manningâs play on Sunday would suffer because of a missed workout. After all, Manning â who had not appeared on the Giantsâ injury report all season â is pretty familiar with the Giantsâ offensive schemes. âHeâs a red belt,â Carr said, referring to Manning’s mastery of his role. âHeâs not going to miss anything.â The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
