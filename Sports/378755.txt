A ruling is expected in federal court as soon as next week on whether the trustee for the victims of Bernard L. Madoffâs massive fraud can appeal a decision that would make it difficult to recover potentially hundreds of millions of dollars from the owners of the Mets. The appeal must be approved by United States District Judge Jed S. Rakoff, who in September dismissed nine of the 11 counts filed by the trustee against the Metsâ owners.

At the time, he ruled that Irving H. Picard, the trustee, had to prove that Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, the Metsâ owners, willfully turned a blind eye to indications of possible fraud in Madoffâs operation during their years of investing with him. âWillful blindnessâ is a higher legal standard to meet than the one that Picard has argued for. The Metsâ owners have denied being aware of any red flags about Madoff. Picard opposed other aspects of Rakoffâs ruling and is asking the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to reverse Rakoffâs dismissal of the nine counts against Wilpon and Katz. In his September ruling, Rakoff also reduced Wilpon and Katzâs maximum liability from $1 billion to $386 million in âfictitiousâ profits and principal by reducing the time frame to recover the money from six years to two. Rakoff subsequently decided that the Metsâ owners will face a jury in a trial that is scheduled to begin on March 19. The case is being mediated by Mario M. Cuomo, a former New York governor. For the âinterlocutoryâ appeal that Picard has asked for â one sought before a district court case is decided â the appellate judges must feel confident that the issues are worth hearing. Picardâs case has cast a long shadow over the Mets. Wilpon, Katz, their families and their company, Sterling Equities, had $550 million in accounts with Madoff when he was arrested. The cash crisis that ensued led the team to borrow $25 million in November 2010 from Major League Baseball â a loan that has not been repaid five months after its due date â and then to try to sell a minority stake in the team to the hedge fund manager David Einhorn for $200 million. That deal fell through. Now the Mets are trying to sell 10 limited partnership units of $20 million each to private investors.
