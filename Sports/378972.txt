Throughout the college hockey season, Slap Shot will feature reports about some of the country’s top-ranked teams.  In a weekend series that featured two of the top four offenses in the Western Collegiate Hockey Conference it was all about the goaltenders. Minnesota (17-9-1, 13-5 WCHA), ranked third in the USCHO.com poll, and Colorado College split two one-goal games with the Tigers winning 2-1 on Friday and the Gophers rebounding for a 2-1 victory on Saturday. Aside from a Tigers (14-9-1, 11-7 WCHA) goal by Nick Dineen that came early in the second period most of the action in Fridayâs game was in the final two minutes of the third. Nick Bjugstad scored off of a rebound to tie the score with 1:17 left in regulation. The crowd on more than 10,000 at Mariucci Arena erupted, but soon fell dead silent when Tim Hall scored 41 seconds later and put the Colorado College up for good. âThey had a great effort on their goal and you get another bump out of it because the crowd goes nuts,â Colorado College head coach Scott Owens said. âThen we come back, and it was good for Timmy Hall, a senior, and I thought he played well all night.â For the third weekend in a row the Gophers failed to score on a five-minute major power play. âWe had in-zone offensive time but we couldnât get enough to the net,â Gophers head coach Don Lucia said. The Tigers struck first again Saturday night when Jaden Schwartz took a pass from behind the net and beat Gophers goalie Kent Patterson glove-side. Minnesota tied the contest three minutes later when Nate Condon took a drop pass from Taylor Matson and scored a shorthanded goal. Condon has nine goals on the season, four have been scored shorthanded. âTaylor and I just take advantage of the opportunities that we get,â Condon said. âA lot of times on the power play they have one defenseman back so if we can jump up the ice itâs an odd-man rush for us.â Nico Sacchetti scored his first goal of the year one quarter of the way through the second. The goal from the senior who was playing in his eighth game of the season proved as the game winner. âIâm happy for Nico, heâs been frustrated and Iâm sure he wants to play more,â Lucia said. âA game like he played tonight you know he deserves to play more, so heâll get rewarded next week.â Patterson had 44 saves on the weekend, Tigersâ net minder Josh Thorimbert had 73. Both goalies gave up three goals on the weekend. âIt was kind of a mirror image of how we were playing at the beginning of the year,â Patterson said. â[The defense] was letting me make the first save, and they were making the first save some of the time and theyâre blocking shots, clearing pucks out and picking up guys on the backdoor making sure they werenât getting easy tap-ins.â Minnesota started the season by going 9-1 and has gone 8-8-1 since sweeping North Dakota at home in early November. With the split the Gophers now sit alone in first place in the WCHA, two points in front of Minnesota Duluth and four in front of the Tigers. Had Colorado College swept the Gophers there would have been a three-way tie atop the conference standings with the Gophers, UMD and Colorado College. UMD swept a nonconference series Alabama Huntsville last weekend and did not receive any conference points. Minnesota will take on St. Cloud State next weekend in a home-and-home series. Fridayâs game will be at Mariucci Arena and Saturdayâs will take place at the National Hockey Center in St. Cloud, Minn. Drew Claussen is a sports reporter for The Minnesota Daily.
