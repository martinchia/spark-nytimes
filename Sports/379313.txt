LOS ANGELES â Carmelo Anthony is dominating the N.B.A.’s All-Star weekend, without making a single move on the court. Anthony, the Denver Nuggets’ discontented  forward, appears closer than ever to getting his wish â a trade to the New York metropolitan area. The only question, with six days to go before the trading deadline, may be which side of the Hudson River he will land on. The Nets and the Knicks have both been engaged in talks with the Nuggets, but the Nets appeared to move into the lead position Friday morning. The Record of Woodland Park, N.J., is reporting that the Nets and Nuggets have agreed to a deal, pending a sign-off from Anthony, who must agree to a contract extension for the Nets to consummate the trade. Anthony, who can become a free agent this summer, wants a three-year, $65 million extension from whichever team acquires him. The two things can happen simultaneously in what the league refers to as an extend-and-trade deal. Conversely, Anthony can scuttle almost any deal by refusing to sign an extension. Anthony was scheduled to speak with reporters here at 3:30 p.m., as part of the traditional All-Star Friday interview session. Several news media outlets have reported that the Nets owner Mikhail D. Prokhorov plans to meet with Anthony this weekend, possibly as soon as Friday afternoon. The Associated Press quoted Anthony on Friday as saying, “No meeting at all” is scheduled. If Anthony cannot be sold on the Nets’ future, he could refuse the extension, moving the Knicks back into the lead. Anthony has all along been pushing for a trade to the Knicks. According to The Record, the Nets would acquire Anthony, along with Chauncey Billups, Shelden Williams, Melvin Ely and Renaldo Balkman in a deal built around Derrick Favors â a 2010 lottery pick â  Devin Harris and four first-round draft picks. For salary-cap purposes, the Nuggets would also get Troy Murphy and Ben Uzoh. Murphy could in turn be dealt to a third team, along with one or more picks, according to several reports. According to The Daily News, a Knicks contingent, led by the Madison Square Garden chairman James Dolan, is also planning to meet with Anthony this weekend.
