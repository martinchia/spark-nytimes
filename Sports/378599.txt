Four or five straight hours of tennis doesnât seem to faze the playersâeven if Donald Young looked a bit wobbly after his marathon Friday nightâbut itâs tough on spectators. Not the matches themselves,  but the heat, the sun, above all the surging crowds moving in a constant swarm through the grounds and inducing the claustrophobic feel of a subway platform with no train in sight. Where to find respite without exiting the scene? You might try the U.S.T.A. bookstore. Outer-court geeks may remember it used to occupy two smallish booths near Court 10. But this year it has been given a spacious new venue inside the Chase Center,  across the walkway from Armstrong Stadium. Guess what: itâs a real bookstore, tennis-centric, to be sure, but with actual books to browse–printed words that arenât draw sheets or scoreboards.  When I stopped in Thursday at about 4 p.m., Allen Fox was signing paperback copies of his 2010 book  âTennis: Winning the Mental Match.â Dr. Fox, as heâs identified on the cover, coached the Pepperdine University tennis team in many glorious seasons and has worked with a number of top players, including Brad Gilbert, Dinara Safina and Sam Querrey. He currently coaches Igor Kunitsyn, who presumably employed his mentorâs teachings in winning his first and second round matches at this yearâs Open. This seasonâs hottest tennis book, âRafa,â the starâs best-selling memoir, with heartthrob cover photo, sits in eye-catching stacks near the storefront. âItâs been our runaway best-seller this week,â said the shop’s manager, Rick Rennert — even though Nadal declined, after some deliberation,  to sign copies on the premises, lest it distract him from his main task.  (He did agree to a signing at Barnes & Noble, in Manhattan, just before play began; but the event was canceled because of Hurricane Irene). A more accommodating memoirist was Andre Agassi. Multiple paperback copies of his best-seller âOpenâ are also plainly on view. âHe stopped by last year and signed copies,â Rennert said. How many? âI donât have the exact number here, but it was a lot. A couple of hundred, and he was nice to every person he signed for.â Rennert — towering, nattily-attired and genial — is himself a fixture at the Open. This is his 15th year on site, dating back to 1997, when he he was hired by the U.S.T.A., after a long career as a  book editor and publisher, to form a publishing department.  It’s a many-tentacled job.  When not readying the bookstore for the Open, Rennert oversees an array of publications, which range from the glossy annual U.S. Open program — in reality a Vogue-sized magazine (contributing writers this year include Bud Collins and John Feinstein) — to âThe Open Book,â a handsomely illustrated coffee-table item released a few years ago. The bookstoreâs staple is books on strategy, no-nonsense manuals that promise to lift your game. Fans hungrily seek them out. âTheyâll come in each year and say, âWhat have you got?ââ Rennert told me. But there are also spiritual-advice volumes like âGame, Set, Lifeâ and novelty items like âStrung Outâ (billed as a âtennis mysteryâ). Rennert buys these titles, which are often self-published, on consignment, meaning he splits the proceeds with authors and then returns the unsold copies.   And while he generously dispenses  wild cards, giving newcomers a shot, âI vet everything,â he said firmly. Rennert was for some years the head of Chelsea House, a publisher of young adult nonfiction books, and this background shows in the display of childrenâs titles — including an illustrated biography of the great champion Althea Gibson (twice a winner of the Open — or the U.S. National Singles Championship, as it was then called), who is still perhaps the most unsung African-American athlete of the 20th century. And for parents who have brought young children to Flushing and subjected them to one too many matches, and allowed them one too many soft drinks, thereâs much else to browse — for instance, two walls of framed photographs, about 30 in all, of Arthur Ashe. They are the work of Asheâs widow, Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, a professional photographer who was at the bookstore last week to set up the exhibit.   A second installation, on loan from the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I., is a giant illustrated timeline of tennis history, built on the theme of the sport in wartime (an acknowledgement, suitably oblique, to the approaching 10th anniversary of 9/11). It too has been presented with care, in this instance by Douglas Stark, the director of the Newport museum, who like Rennert will be in the store each day of the tournament.  So far business has been brisk. “Sales are up more than 50 percent over last year,” Rennert noted. “Who says bookstores are dying?” He credits the new location, but exudes the pride of a book-person. “We’re in the Chase Center,” he said. “But I tell people weâre the cultural center.” After a day of ferocious sun, brutal competition and of milling with thousands of strangers, it feels more like an oasis. Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
