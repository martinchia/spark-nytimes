Andy Murray had to endure an 11 1/2-minute nightmare before realizing the greatest dream of his life at Wimbledon on Sunday. Murray defeated Novak Djokovic, 6-4, 7-5, 6-4, to win the men’s singles championship. The climax of the match was mind-blowing as Murray unsuccessfully tried to convert three match points in a row, then saved three break points before finally nailing the victory on his fourth attempt. Winning that final game was the single toughest thing Murray has had to do in his career. It was 14 points of pure hell.  Murray was interviewed after the trophy presentation, and the gravity of the last game weighed heavily on his mind. âI am still in a bit of shock, to be honest,â Murray said. âThe last game took a lot out of me mentally. That last game was very, very challenging mentally. Probably the hardest few points I have ever had to play in my life.â Murray said in the trophy presentation that he did not know how he managed to win the final game. It was such a traumatic experience for him that it really had a profound effect on his mental state. When asked how much he remembered of the last point, he said: âI have no idea what happened. I really donât know what happened.â The excitement that he felt from finally winning the title was mixed with bewilderment from almost losing it. Getting across the finish line was far more taxing mentally and emotionally than any of the physical aspects of the three grueling sets they played. Murray led, 2-0, in the third set before falling behind, 4-2, as Djokovic got back into the match with a barrage of drop shots that pulled Murray out of his comfort zone behind the baseline. Murray then won the last four games of the set, but it was in the last one that the drama ratcheted up. Murray raced to a 40-0 lead after Djokovic missed a backhand down the line, Murray hit a forehand winner down the line off a drop shot, and Djokovic sent a backhand return sailing long. Three match points — take your pick. The ecstasy of victory would be delayed by the agony of Djokovic clawing back into the game and almost stealing it. Djokovic approached on the first match point and had to hit three volleys before hitting a winner. On the second match point Djokovic stepped in and crushed Murrayâs second serve back down the line with a backhand winner. Djokovic got back to deuce when Murray sent a down-the-line backhand just over the baseline. Murray was so close to winning, but Djokovic has proved to be the ultimate fighter. Murray missed a forehand into the net to hand Djokovic his first break point, but delivered a strong first serve down the middle that Djokovic could not return. One break point saved. In a cruel blow to Murray on the next point, Djokovic hit a difficult backhand half-volley that kissed the top of the net and dropped over. Break point No. 2 was saved with a Murray forehand approach winner at the end of an incredible 20-shot rally. Djokovic got to a third break point when he chased down a drop shot and hit a forehand short-angled cross-court winner. Break point No. 3 was saved with a backhand volley winner from Murray after a big serve and forehand approach to Djokovicâs backhand. Murray had no right to win the next deuce point, as Djokovic hit a strong forehand approach up the line and Murray threw up a high lob. Djokovic could have gone anywhere with the overhead, but he hit it right back at Murray, who ended up at the net forcing a backhand volley error from Djokovic. Murrayâs fourth match point lasted four shots. A monster first serve wide to Djokovicâs backhand came back floating like a butterfly just inside the baseline. Murray hit a forehand to Djokovicâs backhand and Djokovic pulled the trigger with a big backhand down the line. It found the tape and fell back on his side. Game, set, history, Murray. The agony of blowing three match points, then digging so deep to save three break points blew the tension of the match into the stratosphere.
