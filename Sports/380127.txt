For the second straight year, Andy Murray will be talking to Straight Sets regularly throughout his run at the United States Open. Last year, topics of conversation ranged from his love of boxing, to building the perfect player. His whirlwind run ended when he broke through for his first Grand Slam title, with a five-set victory over Novak Djokovic in Arthur Ashe Stadium. In his first conversation this year, Murray discussed returning for the Open and how the pressures on him have changed over the past 12 months.  What were your thoughts as you walked back on the court of Arthur Ashe for the first time this week?  Yeah, the first thing that you feel every time you walk on there, especially when itâs empty, you do realize exactly how big the stadium is. Â But itâs the first time Iâd been on the court obviously since last year, and as I was saying last year I didnât really feel like I had the chance to enjoy it, because I was â I donât know â it was just so much relief. Â So actually coming back and actually remembering last year and stuff was really nice. Because last year, I donât know, it was just pure relief, really, after the match, rather than âIâm so excited to have won a Grand Slam.â 
Q.
 Do you think that now that you have the burden off your back, youâre in a more fun stage of your career?
A.
 Yeah, I think so, definitely. Iâm not going to play under the same pressure that Iâve had to the last five, six years. Â Thatâs not going to happen again. Â I mean, I would expect now that I would be able to enjoy the semifinals and finals of Grand Slams more now than I wouldâve done even just a few months ago.
Q.
 When Marion Bartoli retired, she talked about how she had accomplished her dreams and didnât have anything else left to do. Youâve now won Wimbledon and a Grand Slam before that. What keeps you going? 
A.
 I think trying to win more Grand Slams. Because it took me such a long time to do it, I know how hard they are to win, that I might as well enjoy the challenge of trying to do it now. The Australian Open, for me, would be a big goal because Iâve been to the final there three times, and a semifinal with Novak on top of that. Iâd love to try and win there. And yeah obviously the French Open, trying to reach the final there as well, would be another goal. To play in all four Slam finals, I would be able to say, having played in the Olympic final as well, that Iâve at least given myself an opportunity to compete for all the major trophies in my career.
Q.
 Do you wish that youâd allowed yourself to enjoy winning here more last year?
A.
 Obviously, yeah. Always when you finish winning a tournament, you wish you had more time to enjoy it. Â But unfortunately with the way things are nowadays, thereâs a lot of people you need to try and keep happy when you finish playing. Rather than actually being able to just sit down with your team or your friends and family, youâre kind of whisked off to do all sorts of other things. So yeah, I would have liked to have enjoyed it more, but it wasnât to be. But like I said, it was just pure relief. For so many years, it was that much pressure. To not have to worry about that anymore was nice.
Q.
 I think a lot of people sympathized with how much pressure you felt and you trying to break through. Now that youâve won multiple Grand Slams, do you feel like a less sympathetic character?
A.
 Yeah, I donât really know. I think coming into these tournaments, there was always â I donât know â I wasnât necessarily the favorite coming in, but it was almost like I was playing with the pressure of someone that was expected to win and had done it many times before. So now that thereâs that expectation to win, that I may be one of the favorites, but I personally donât feel I have the same pressure on me as before.
