On Monday, Malek Jaziri became the first Tunisian player to ever win a match at a Grand Slam tennis event during the Open era, which began in 1968. On Thursday he will play Mardy Fish, the top-seeded American, in a show court at the United States Open. This is the easy part. The hard part was leaving his homeland early this year, during the political uprising that has spread to much of the Middle East.  âI was on a plane and I could hear helicopters and pop-pop-pop,â Jaziri said Tuesday at the Open. âSomebody on my flight was dangerous so they canceled the flight.â The next day, he caught a flight, and his tennis career has begun to take off. Mondayâs victory in the first round raised his world ranking to 181, the best it has ever been.  Unrest and tennis do not necessarily go hand in hand, although there was the Tennis Court Oath on June 20, 1789, during the French Revolution. Jaziri loves his country, and loves his home city, Bizerte (âthe Venice of Tunisia; the sea inside the cityâ), and he makes no political comments whatsoever. He is thrilled to represent Tunisia, to go farther than any player has ever gone since the Open began. (Mustapha Belkhodja, also from Tunisia, had some success reached at the French 0pen and Wimbledon in the 1960s.) On Monday after his 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Thiemo de Bakker of the Netherlands, Jaziri received a call from a Tunisian number he did not recognize. âWho are you?â he asked. Turned out it was the minister of sport. âI did not recognize the number,â Jaziri said. They had a nice chat, giving Jaziri the feeling that people at home were happy with what he has done in a year that is memorable for other things. Tunisia has been in the spotlight since January, when Mohamed Bouazizi, a fruit vendor, burned himself to death in public. The ensuing emotions toppled the government and sent waves through the entire region. Jaziri, 27, was mostly trying to resurrect a career. He learned the game on the courts of the Club AthlÃ©tique Bizertin (CAB), a leader in northern African soccer and other sports. He did not play from 2007 into 2009 because of a knee injury, and was rehabilitating his game on the clay courts of Barcelona with his coach Wallid Jallali, a former tour player who never reached a major tournament. While Jaziri was home, the unrest began. âHe was scared, but he needs to practice, so we decided to go to Colombia,â Jallali said. âSo we flew from Tunis to Paris to Bogota.â Since then, Jaziri has been playing the best tennis of his life, while following the complicated changes from afar. âOne side is positive, people can speak, they can act, do what they want,â Jallali said. âThe other side is things are not so organized. Everybody does what they want.â Because of encouraging results in the far-flung tournaments, Jaziri and Jallali headed for New York. The coach, who lived outside Toronto for a while, knew New York a little but Jaziri had never been here. âWe stay near Times Square,â the coach said. âEvery night we go out for dinner, something different. Italian food. Anything we want.â Jaziri did not fast during the daylight hours during the recent holy month of Ramadan. âThe coach fasts,â Jallali said. âGod forgives. He is working. He must be strong.â Out in that most multicultural borough of Queens, the player from Bizerte has prospered. Jaziri won three straight matches in the qualifier tournament at the tennis center last week, earning a spot in the main draw of the Open. They both love the mood of the Open because fans are demonstrative and know the sport.  On Tuesday, Jaziri practiced in the Armstrong stadium, the second largest court at the Open, to prepare for his match with Fish. âHe is the top American, it will be on a main court,â Jaziri said with enthusiasm. He does not carry himself like a man heading out to be cannon fodder for the eighth-ranked player in the tournament. He acts like a player having the best days of his career. Part of Jaziriâs open, competitive nature comes from his early exposure to soccer, another sport of his homeland. His older brother, Emir, played the sport and is now the director of the thriving soccer program at CAB.  Soccer positions are often an indication of personality. What position did Jaziri play as a younger? Left defender, he said. âBut he plays tennis like a forward,â his coach noted. Like an offensive-minded back in soccer, Jaziri has already advanced the ball farther than any Tunisian player has ever done. He is proud to be representing his homeland. His career has taken off ever since he heard the pop-pop-pop at the airport,  Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
