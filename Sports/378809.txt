George Vecsey of the Times assesses the first few months of the Jurgen Klinsmann era in a column that is on nytimes.com and will be in Tuesday’s print editions. On Monday, he joined Klinsmann and the team on its visit to the September 11 Memorial in Manhattan. A lot of teams have visited the former site of the World Trade Center, some of them New York franchises looking to pay tribute to the people who died there and rescued there and rebuilt there. But this visit was different â this was a team that wears red, white and blue at every game it plays. âFor us, as a soccer team representing the United States, itâs a wonderful opportunity,â Klinsmann said as his players inspected the honor rolls and the reflecting pools. âYes, we are only representing soccer, but we have a generation of people with dual citizenship,â Klinsmann said. âThis gives us a deep sense, a deep connection, of who we represent â a very special country, an amazing country.â  Read the column here, and come back to comment.
