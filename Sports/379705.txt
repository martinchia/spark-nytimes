Lemelin, a 13-year veteran who will be 36 on Nov. 19, appeared en route to his 12th career shutout until the Canucks threw a scare into the Bruins. The Canucks trailed by 2-0 until Trevor Linden ruined the shutout bid by intercepting Jim Wiemer's pass in the Boston zone and scoring his fifth goal with 2:48 remaining. The Canucks pulled its goalie, Troy Gamble, for a sixth skater and the strategy paid off at 18:33 as Garth Butcher scored his second goal, beating Lemelin from just outside the crease.

He deflected a pass off his skate and into the net at 4:41 of the first period, put a wrist shot between the legs of goaltender Jeff Reese at 15:45 and scored from a bad angle on a rebound during a power play for his third goal early in the second period.
