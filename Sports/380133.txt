Advertisement  PEDRO GUERRERO agreed to a one-year contract with the St. Louis Cardinals yesterday for $2,425,000 rather than go to arbitration. The salary represents a 6.1 percent raise from the $2,283,333 Guerrero received in 1991. The 35-year-old Guerrero, a 12-year veteran, hit .272 last year with 8 homers and 70 runs batted in. He missed 47 games after suffering a leg fracture in a July 7 collision in the field with his own catcher, TOM PAGNOZZI. Guerrero is scheduled to play left field this season after playing first base for St. Louis since August 1988. The Cardinals acquired first baseman Andres Galarraga from the Montreal Expos in a trade earlier this off season. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
