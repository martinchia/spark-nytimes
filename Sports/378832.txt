Alex Rodriguez was scratched from the Yankeesâ lineup Tuesday with what he described as a jammed left thumb two hours before the Yankees played the Oakland Athletics at Yankee Stadium. Rodriguez said he was injured Sunday trying to make a backhand stop on a ground ball hit by Joe Mauer in a 3-0 victory over the Minnesota Twins in Minneapolis. It was Rodriguezâs first game with the Yankees since July 7. He had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee July 11. âThe good news is the knee feels great,â Rodriguez said before Tuesdayâs game. Rodriguez said he iced his thumb Tuesday afternoon and was to have it X-rayed. Rodriguez, who has a .290 batting average and 13 home runs, had been scheduled to hit fourth in the lineup. He went 0 for 5 Sunday. He described his thumb injury as a âbump in the roadâ and said he did not think he would be out of the starting lineup more than one day. âIâm going to look at this in the positive,â he said. âHopefully, we get a win tonight to keep this train moving forward.â Eric Chavez started at third base for the Yankees, and Mark Teixeira was moved from third in the batting order to the cleanup spot. Rodriguez said he was available to pinch-hit or pinch-run, but his left thumb was noticeably swollen. Rodriguez took early batting practice, taking about 25 swings, but said he found the bat hard to grip. He said it was even more painful to put on his glove. He said he was encouraged with how his body responded otherwise to his first game in six weeks. An hour before the announcement, Manager Joe Girardi fielded several questions about how he planned to use Rodriguez as he returned from knee surgery. Girardi said he would probably check with Rodriguez daily. âItâll be kind of a day by day thing for a while, until we get through this long 16 days of games,â said Girardi, whose team has no days off until Sept. 8. Asked if Rodriguez was as honest as other players at telling him how he was feeling, Girardi smiled and said, âHe may not be as good at hiding it as other players, but heâs usually pretty good about it.â Rodriguez said he would meet Friday in Baltimore with Major League Baseball officials about reports of his involvement in high-stakes poker games. ROTATION AS IS Joe Girardi said that he would not pull a starting pitcher from his six-man rotation until he has to, probably next week, and that his decision would not be affected by the size of a pitcherâs contract or how much experience he has in the bullpen. These would not seem to be good signs for A. J. Burnett, the right-hander who a $16.5 million-a-year salary and has pitched in relief only four times in 307 major league appearances. Burnett has a 10.70 earned run average in August. âWhatever we feel is the best decision moving forward,â Girardi said when asked if Burnettâs lack of bullpen experience would be a factor. Girardi said Freddy Garcia, who has been sidelined with a cut on the ring finger of his pitching hand, is scheduled to start the second game of a doubleheader Saturday at Baltimore. Garcia allowed two runs in four innings Monday in a rehabilitation start for Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. âUsually, when you get a report right after a guy makes a rehab start, something went wrong, but I didnât hear anything went wrong,â Girardi said. But Girardiâs plans may be scuttled by poor weather that is predicted to sweep the East Coast this weekend. Heavy rains from Hurricane Irene are forecast to hit Baltimore, where the Yankees are to play five games between Thursday and Sunday. QUAKE AFTERMATH Jason Zillo, a Yankees spokesman, said electricians and engineers went through a âpretty thorough checklistâ at Yankee Stadium and reported nothing irregular after the earthquake that shook the region. Girardi said he was working out and felt nothing. He found out about the earthquake only after receiving a text message from his wife, wondering if he felt anything. She was in a dentistâs chair at the time. âI donât know if that changed her filling or anything,â Girardi said, laughing.
