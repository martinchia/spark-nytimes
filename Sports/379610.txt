This seasonâs mantra among the Red Bullsâ players and coaches is to âplay the right way,â as in maintain possession of the ball and keep it on the ground. And that was what the Red Bulls did for 70 minutes in their M.L.S. opener against visiting Seattle on Saturday night at Red Bull Arena, as each player caressed the ball and made the Sounders chase after scoring opportunities. It was then that the teamâs new defensive midfielder, Teemu Tainio of Finland, decided it was time for a changeup. He launched a long ball over the Soundersâ defense that was collected by Juan Agudelo, and Agudelo held off a defender and scored past goalkeeper Kasey Keller. âPass the ball around, not kick it forward, that is the right way,â forward Thierry Henry said. Henry said that before he arrived in M.L.S., there was a widely held perception â often backed up by on-field play â that league games often turned into track meets, with long balls and little possession play. Coach Hans Backe said: âThe right way? Itâs when you click and see rhythm and sharpness.â Tainio, 31, who has had previous stints with Tottenham in England and Ajax in the Netherlands, played a strong game in his M.L.S. debut. âIt was really tight, so I decided to try a long ball,â he said after Saturdayâs game. âI saw he was going, and he did the rest. You have to vary things sometime. Thereâs no point to always playing short. This time, we caught them off guard.â Corner kick: Is it too much to expect for a team in M.L.S. — especially one that had a dozen coaches in the league’s first 15 years — to have a style of its own? Is that a worthy goal for the league’s teams, or even for the national team?  Or is soccer in the United States better served by continuing to adapt to the players at hand, and by having them play, as Henry said, “the right way” as much as possible?
