It was a kinder, gentler Antrel Rolle at the Super Bowl media day, no matter how hard the contingent of reporters tried to push for something bolder. Having come under fire for being too confident in his predictions for Sundayâs game, Rolle, the Giants’ veteran safety, has taken a step back in the last few days, and that continued in his interview. âNo one is going to give it to me more real than my mother,â Rolle said when asked if it was his motherâs influence that persuaded him to tone things down. âSheâs always going to be real with me, and Iâm always going to be real with her.â Staying true to his new form, in 60 minutes of questioning, Rolle made few predictions and managed to say his catch-phrase, âat the end of the day,â just one time. There were two times when Rolle broke character. The first was when Deion Sanders, in his role as a journalist for the NFL Network, gave Rolle a hard time for backing off his prediction of victory (as Sanders is a fan of outrageous confidence) and the second was when Rolleâs teammate Deon Grant came over to ask him a few questions. Rolle started out explaining, at Grantâs request, what it means when he refers to âAK-47 with the Clipâ saying that his number, 26, and Kenny Phillipsâs number, 21, combine to equal 47, and that they wouldnât work without the clip, with the clip being Grant. Grant asked if the secondary would be able to handle the Patriots’ two big tight ends. âThink? Nah, I donât think. I know it!â Rolle said in what was most likely his brashest statement. It was not the first time, and would not be the last, that Rolle was asked about how the Giants would defend Patriots tight ends Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez. In the often tedious world of media day, where reporters rotate among players, Rolle was most often asked about those tight ends, his mother, his experiences with the Cardinals in Super Bowl XLIII and his time at the University of Miami. In the meta world of media day, one of the journalists thought to ask Rolle if he felt the questions asked had been intelligent. âThereâs been a lot of great questions, a lot of insight and a lot of redundant questions,â Rolle said. âIt is what it is.â While Rolle chose not to compare this team directly to the Cardinals team that lost to the Steelers three years ago, he did say that heâd learned from that Super Bowl experience. âMy phones will be off throughout the week, something I donât think Iâve ever done,â Rolle said. âIâm not going to be worrying about anything outside.â The player often accused of possessing a bark much larger than his bite summed up his new attitude succinctly toward the end of his interview session. âThereâs nothing else to be said,” Rolle said. “Weâre here. Itâs time to play ball.â The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
