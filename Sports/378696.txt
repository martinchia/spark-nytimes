Florida 38, Georgia 7 JACKSONVILLE, Fla., (AP) -- Shane Matthews threw for 344 yards and three touchdowns and Florida's defense scored on an interception return and set up two other first-half touchdowns, leading the Gators to victory over Georgia in a Southeastern Conference game. Advertisement Florida (8-1 over all, 5-1 in the S.E.C.) ended a three-game losing streak in the annual neutral-site series.

It was the second straight loss for Auburn (6-2-1) and the Tigers' first defeat at home since 1987.
