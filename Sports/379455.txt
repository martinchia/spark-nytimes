SANDWICH, England â When Jerry Kelly learned earlier this week that he would be hitting the opening tee shot in the 140th British Open on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. local time, he was amused. After all, eight years should be long enough for the pain to subside from the not-so-funny episode that happened at royal St. George’s in 2003. That was when, on the first hole, Kelly drove the ball into the rough, slashed his way to an 11, wound up hurting his shoulder, shot 86 and withdrew after one round. So, after a bogey ensued when Kelly split the fairway with his drive Thursday, bounced a sand wedge over the green and failed to get his ball up and down, it felt like a victory. âAs I told Peter Dawson,â he said, referring to the chief executive of the Royal and Ancient, âI thought it was quite an honor. I enjoyed that. I recognized the irony in it after what happened the last time.â Kelly, who improved his score by a dozen strokes with a 74, said the course was set up a little easier than in 2003. âThe rough at No. 1 was up to the waist,â he said. âNow itâs just up to the knees. Itâs much more playable this time.â
