When sheâs not delivering aces, Serena Williams doles out relationship advice. She and her sister, Venus, were in the locker room Wednesday at the United States Open when they bumped into Caroline Wozniacki, the world No. 1 and girlfriend of the golfer, Rory McIlroy, the reigning United States Open champion from Northern Ireland.  Both Williamses have been linked to pro athletes. Serena once reportedly went out with the N.F.L. linebacker LaVar Arrington and Venus dated the golfer Hank Kuehne. Wozniacki said both sisters offered her a few relationship tips.  âIt just came out that we were talking a bit and we had a laugh,â she said Thursday after her straight-sets win over Arantxa Rus. âWe were just kidding around a little bit.â  Was it sound advice?  âI told her never look through the guy’s phone,â Serena said after her straight-sets victory against Michaella Krajicek. âThat is the worst thing you can do.  I told her most relationships end.â  She laughed. âIt wasnât very good advice,â Serena said. âI hope she didnât listen.â  When Wozniacki heard what Serena â a potential semifinal foe — had told reporters, it was her turn to laugh.   âYeah, I think I should not listen to her or Venus. She was not better.â   Wozniacki have talked openly about each other since going public with their romance last month, which encourages people to ask more questions about their relationship. Asked if she worries that the attention paid to her love life will affect her tennis, Wozniacki said, âWell, tennis is my first priority and I’m focused on the tennis when I’m on court, that’s for sure.   âYou know, what I do off the court, I know that I’m a public person, so a lot of things will be seen by the public,â she said. âBut, you know, I don’t really think about it.  You know, I think we have our limits and we know where they are.  So as long as we both keep the feet on the ground and, you know, we both have our careers, which are important to us, I think it’s working well.â   Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
