Advertisement  GOLF  Beck Leads by 4 Chip Beck set a two-round tournament record and grabbed a four-shot lead by shooting a 65 yesterday in the second round of the $1 million Freeport McMoRan Golf Classic in New Orleans. Beck's 36-hole total was 132 and broke the record of 135 set in 1989 by Dan Forsman and Tim Simpson. His 65 was one shot off the course record of 64 set by Joel Edwards last year. Brad Bryant, who shot a 69 yesterday, was at 136. (AP) Rodriguez Moves Ahead: If there's a runaway at the Tradition in Scottsdale, Ariz., it will have to come in the last two rounds. Jack Nicklaus, who has won the Senior PGA Tour tournament two straight years by coming from behind, shot a seven-under-par 65 in the first round and seemed poised for a stroll. In the second round, however, Chi Chi Rodriguez scored a 66 and took a one-shot lead with a 36-hole total of 9-under-par 135. He started four shots behind Nicklaus and wound up one shot in front of Lee Trevino and two strokes ahead of the first-day leader, who had an even-par 72.

International. (AP) TENNIS  Arrese Defeats Lendl  Top-seeded Ivan Lendl was upset by Jordi Arrese of Spain, 6-3, 4-6, 7-5, in a quarterfinal match yesterday at the Estoril Open in Lisbon. Lendl, serving to stay in the match at 5-6 in the third set, made a series of unforced errors and finally lost to Arrese by sending a lob that landed just outside the baseline. Arrese will be part of an all-Spanish semifinal that includes the defending champion, Sergi Bruguera; Emilio Sanchez and Carlos Costa.
