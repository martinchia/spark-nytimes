All through the baseball playoffs, Mike Tanier will provide the Bats blog with daily updates on less-than-important developments from around the league. He vows to keep Phillies homerism to a minimum. Dance Like No One Is Watching: We begin by celebrating, rather tepidly, along with Cardinals fans in a happening sports bar after the Braves loss to the Phillies clinched a wild card berth for the Cardinals Wednesday night: To enhance your viewing pleasure, some video analysis: 0:07	Obligatory out-of-control chubby guy (every bar has one; he comes with the liquor license) either erupts with unbridled joy or ruptures spleen. 0:15	Judging from the haircut and shirt, this fellow was spliced in from video of the 1981 divisional championship. Or a Styx concert. 0:18	Celebrating does not necessarily require leaving your seat. It is, after all, just the wild card.  0:21	Woman begins postseason-appropriate slinky dance. When you are pretty, no one notices that you are also uncoordinated. 0:26	Everyone knows that a sports bar celebration is really just a ready excuse to hug strange women. Here, a man is so overcome with spontaneous emotion that he lurches halfway across the dining room in search of his quarry. Note the elder fan with the Stan Musial jersey, quite possibly Musial himself, in the background. 0:31 	Fans celebrating belatedly watch high-definition images of their favorite team celebrating belatedly. Really, itâs hard to be spontaneous when you have spent 90 minutes wondering whether you will be guzzling champagne or reviewing Freddie Freeman scouting reports.  0:35	Second appearance of Elaine Benes dance-alike. 0:46	Note the flagging enthusiasm, the seven empty beers on the table, the Yankees game in the background, and the pen behind the guy on the rightâs ear. The woman on the left grimaces as harsh reality sets in: it is late, the Cardinals must face the Phillies, no one is leaving the bar until the other games end, and she is stuck associating with the kind of guy who takes notes in social settings. 0:49	Things have really deteriorated in under a minute, havenât they? 0:57	The video starts the fade. Look, there in the distance, beyond the trees. There is something dangling from the rafters. Is that a Red Sox fan? Oh wait, my computer switched over to my kidsâ DVD of “The Wizard of Oz.” Itâs just a bird. A swell time was had by all. And of course, we all look a little silly when partying after midnight (or near midnight, Missouri time). At least the folks in that video have an excuse. Unlike the folks in this video. The Curious Case of the Eight-Hole Hitter: Catcher Kelly Soppach batted eighth for the Rays last night, as he often does when he is not batting ninth. Soppach is a typical backup catcher–good arm, some pop, the ability to sometimes hit his weight–but the Rays needed him in 86 games this season. A guy with a .179 batting average and more double plays than doubles isnât the best choice when the bases are loaded with no outs in the eighth inning, you are trailing 7-0, and your rival in the wild card race has a one-run lead that will likely stick for at least another hour, because it is raining.  So the Rays turned to mighty Sam Fuld and his .244 career batting average. Fuld walked and brought in a run, which got a six-run inning into high gear. In the bottom of the ninth, the Rays decided they needed more â¦ something, so they replaced Fuld with Dan Johnson, who batted .108 this season. Johnson batted .198 in 2010 and .192 in 2008. He spent 2009 in Japan, where he batted .215. He is a first baseman, not a catcher with a cannon arm or a utility man who can play six positions. He may have the most improbable career in modern baseball history. He survives because he is the ultimate minor league slugger, a guy who can bat .300 with 30 home runs at the AAA level but cannot handle big league stuff. Except in the bottom of the ninth, against the Yankees, with the playoffs on the line, when he hits home runs. He is a situational player. Johnson is not much of a fielder, so the Rays replaced him with Brandon Guyer, a September call-up with a .175 batting average. How many of these guys can one team have? Guyer singled in the bottom of the 11th inning to put two men on base with one out. Scott Proctor got out of the inning, but he had to work a little harder to do it, and Guyer helped turn the lineup over, which set up the 12th inning. The Rays are loaded with .200-level hitters of indeterminate origin who can drive opponents bonkers in clutch situations (though some of these guys will not make the playoff roster). Either they are a fluke who capitalized on the Red Sox misfortune and the Yankeesâ relative disinterest, or they are this yearâs San Francisco Giants. The Rangers can have fun figuring out which. Analogue Guy in an Internet World: Miguel Cabrera of the Tigers won the batting title last night, and manager Jim Leyland was willing to go the extra mile to help him, so long as that extra mile contained no long division. Cabrera entered the night batting .343, with Michael Young of the Rangers and Adrian Gonzalez of the Red Sox at .338. Leyland used a chart to keep track of Youngâs and Gonzalezâs batting averages: if Cabrera got a few hits while the others suffered oh-fers, and if the Tigers game ceased to matter because of a Rangers win, Leyland was prepared to pull Cabrera to protect his batting crown, a maneuver sometimes called the Forced Reyes. A chart. Those of us watching at home enjoy real-time statistics: not just batting average, but O.P.S. and B.A.B.I.P. and other arcana, computed on a batter-by-batter basis. But the guy making the decisions is not using a laptop, a calculator, or a cell phone application, but a chart. You can imagine the tiny type, or worse, the hand-written calligraphy of John Napier himself, who took quill to parchment and used his new-fangled logarithms to compute each Cabrera scenario by hand, then bound his results into a leather-covered tome with the title “Ruminations on the Ratios of Hits to Attempts at Battery, and Other Matters Algebraick and Obscure.” As it stands, the chart was useless. Cabrera went 2-for-4, which put the batting title safely out of reach, and the other games ended later than the Tigers game anyway. Orioles Win! Orioles Win! ESPN did not show much footage of the Orioles celebrating their comeback victory â their 69th of the season! â because the cameras were busy following Jonathan Papelbon as he walked with his head hung low from the mound, into the dugout, out to the parking lot, and eventually hitchhiked out of town like Bruce Banner in the old Incredible Hulk television show. Watch the few images of the victory celebration carefully, and you will see:  Chris Davis flip completely over, dangle his legs in the air for several seconds, and nearly kick Matt Angle in the face. Robert Andino freak out, forget that he is celebrating a win, and start careening about with an angry look on his face like he is either in a brawl or the mosh pit of an Avenged Sevenfold concert. Also, a freeze frame shows a fan in the background wearing a Mets jersey, which is like seeing a cell phone in a Charlie Chaplin movie. So yes, the Orioles need more practice in celebrating. Redskins beat writer Greg Bedard, moonlighting as a baseball writer the way many of us do this time of year, said it best on Twitter: âA movie should be made about the 2011 Orioles. It should be two hours and seven minutes long. 124 minutes of it should be about tonight’s game.â Of course, they do not make movies about the Orioles. They make movies about the Red Sox.  The Bright Side. Cheer up, Red Sox fans. Your team gave you something better than a title: an epic collapse that you can romanticize for generations to come.  You can talk and write about how the 2011 Red Sox galvanized your fandom, robbed you of your innocence, and taught you a valuable lesson about supporting your beloved team through thick and thin, something those spoiled New Yorkers will never understand. You can use the 2011 Red Sox as the dramatic backdrop to coming-of-age tales in which the cocky young protagonist discovers that summer love is fleeting and growing up can be difficult, with the leaves turning and the beaches closing and Jonathan Papelbon not quite closing. And the documentaries! Slow pan-and-scans of grainy images of Camden Yards, close-ups of players with hang-dog expressions, poetic narrations by tweedy baseball historians and irrelevant old political figures who expound on the nation-crippling experience of watching a Boston team not win. You can use the 2011 Red Sox as your ultimate trump card of sports martyrdom, your survival narrative, your excuse to use the phrase âlong sufferingâ with something close to a straight face. No conventional playoff run could provide that. Just remember that when telling your grandchildren about the Great Collapse of 2011, you must leave out the fact that you attended a Bruins Stanley Cup parade three months earlier. Or a Celtics parade two years before that. Or a Red Sox parade the year before that. And skip the three Patriots Super Bowl celebrations. They all get in the way of a good story.
