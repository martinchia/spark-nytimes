The Jets began the season with visions of the Vince Lombardi Trophy, but ended it out of the playoffs. That did not prevent their owner, Woody Johnson, from offering his congratulations to the Giants after their Super Bowl victory Sunday night.  âOn behalf of the New York Jets, I would like to congratulate the Mara and Tisch families, Coach Coughlin and the entire New York Giants organization. It was a closely contested game that showcased all of the best elements that our sport has to offer. The Giants demonstrated poise and resolve in earning a hard-fought victory in Super Bowl XLVI. Also, I want to congratulate the Kraft family, Coach Belichick and the New England Patriots on a tremendous effort and an excellent season.â The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
