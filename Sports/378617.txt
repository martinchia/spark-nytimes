In the bottom of the third inning Monday night during the Mets-Nationals game, the SNY announcer Gary Cohen took on Major League Baseball for refusing to let the Mets commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks by wearing New York Fire Department caps when they played the Cubs on Sunday night. âItâs incomprehensible that M.L.B. somehow thought that was inappropriate,â Cohen said. Cohen has frequently criticized the Mets but has rarely vented about Major League Baseball. With equal parts eloquence and exasperation Monday, he excoriated M.L.B. for failing to grasp why the Metsâ players wanted to wear the F.D.N.Y. caps. Sounding like an op-ed columnist, Cohen said that baseball officials did not understand that âthat no other city in the nation experienced that horrific day and its aftermath like we did in New York.â He added: âThree thousand people died here. Not in Kansas City. Not in Seattle. You know, Milwaukee and Seattle didnât lose 343 firefighters. Unlike Denver or Atlanta, virtually everyone in this city and its suburbs knew somebody who perished that day.â  Cohen disagreed with the way M.L.B. is streamlining the way its teams can honor various causes and tragedies. In the last two years, baseball has received a significant increase in requests by teams to wear nonteam caps or celebratory patches, and has rejected most of them, including the Metsâ desire to wear the Fire Department caps. The policy irritated some Mets. R.A. Dickey said on Twitter that the team had been âconspiringâ to wear the caps until the Mets took them away. Instead of letting the Mets wear caps with the F.D.N.Y. logo, baseball organized a leaguewide slate of tributes under a banner that read, âWe Shall Not Forget.â Cohen described the ceremony at Citi Field as âtouching,â but said that coverage of it was overshadowed by baseballâs âtone deafâ decision to prevent players from wearing caps during the game. Cohen said that M.L.B. should have fully recognized the uniqueness of 9/11 and the way the Mets wanted to honor first responders like the firefighters. âNo other city, not Milwaukee, not Seattle, experienced the fear and horror that day, with clouds of debris billowing down the streets and people racing for their lives,â he said. âAnd to this day, you have firefighters and other first responders who are suffering debilitating illnesses from working on that toxic pile at ground zero, trying desperately to recover either living souls or remains or something.â Through an SNY spokesman, Cohen declined Tuesday to elaborate on his comments.
