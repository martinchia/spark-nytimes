Andy Benoit has contributed weekly film analysis to the Fifth Down this season: Baltimore Ravens (13-4) @ New England Patriots (14-3) Ravens O vs. Patriots D We learned in the divisional round what we already knew: the Ravens struggle to find their passing rhythm (and thus, their general offensive rhythm) whenever deep threat Torrey Smith is taken out of the equation. Smith can be neutralized by a quality cover corner. Fortunately for Baltimore, New England does not have one of those. Devin McCourty was elite as a rookie, but his sophomore slump has been so pronounced that he moved to free safety on passing downs last week against Denver. If the Patriots stick with this approach (and the guess here is they will), the backup Sergio Brown will cover Â Smith or Anquan Boldin opposite Kyle Arrington. Whichever way you slice it â Brown on Smith, Brown on Boldin, Arrington on Smith or Arrington on Boldin â the Ravens have a significant edge in this matchup. With New Englandâs pass rush not being nearly as fierce as Houstonâs, Joe Flacco should rediscover his pocket presence and take advantage. Donât be surprised if the Patriots try to force Flacco into throwing inside by playing Cover 3 or quarters coverage. Recent history says that when Ray Rice is prominently featured, the Ravens win; when heâs not, the Ravens lose. Bill Belichickâs M.O. has always been to take away the offenseâs greatest strength, at whatever cost. That means taking away Rice. Because he lacks the resources to take away Baltimoreâs (albeit inconsistent) passing game, itâll actually be easiest and most effective to dial in on Rice anyway. Last week, inside linebackers Jerod Mayo and Brandon Spikes (finally healthy after missing most of November and all of December with a knee injury) were as fast and strong as theyâve ever been. They can share shadow duties on Rice. Hard-hitting safety Patrick Chung could also factor in as an eighth-box defender. This matchup may ultimately be decided before the snap. Easier than stopping Rice is showing a clear commitment to stopping Rice (aggressive eight-man fronts, hard bites on run action immediately after the snap, etc.). Showing that commitment tempts play-caller Cam Cameron to overreact and abandon the run. Cameron has done that at times this season, but recall, two years ago, his team went into Foxborough and knocked the Patriots out by running on 52 of 62 plays. Advantage: Ravens Patriots O vs. Ravens D New Englandâs formation versatility has soared to new heights. Against Denver, the Patriots often lined up with three wide receivers and two tight ends yet still ran the ball (handoffs to Aaron Hernandez out of the backfield). They can orchestrate a hurry-up offense with no substitutions and still use 10 different formations on 10 different plays. Because no team has enough standout cover artists to adequately handle this, there is always a mismatch favoring the Patriots, regardless of what scheme the defense uses. Itâs just a matter of whether Tom Brady can locate the mismatch. Nine times out of 10, he does. If his pass protection is exceptionally sound, itâs 10 times out of 10. The Ravens’ pass rush has slowed a bit (it was largely ineffective against Cleveland in Week 16 and Cincinnati in Week 17, and it was utterly ineffective against Houston last week). But with stars like Terrell Suggs and Haloti Ngata and underrated specialists like Pernell McPhee and Paul Kruger, the rush can reignite at any moment. If it doesnât, Baltimoreâs chances are slim but not nil. Whatâs interesting is the Ravens might be the one team thatâs capable of handling New Englandâs versatility. They donât quite have the resources to cover both Aaron Hernandez and Rob Gronkowski, but because Lardarius Webb is so good outside and in the slot, the cornerbacking corps matches up fairly well with New Englandâs wide receivers. More important, the Ravens have a middle linebacker and free safety with the sagacity to recognize New Englandâs formations and personnel distributions. Ray Lewis and Ed Reed can audible their defense into the most appropriate look. In other words, the Ravens can play chess with the Patriots. But when you go back to the matchup issues at tight end, the Ravens will feel as if theyâre facing a chess opponent that has two queens. Advantage: Patriots Pick: Patriots 27, Ravens 24 Giants (11-7) @ San Francisco 49ers (14-3) Giants O vs. 49ers D The Giants played an efficient game in their last visit to Candlestick, but their offensive line struggled with the quickness of San Franciscoâs front seven and Brandon Jacobs and D.J. Ware did not produce much on the ground (an injured Ahmad Bradshaw did not play). This is a different Giants offense, though. The offensive line has drastically improved, the run game has blossomed (though itÂ largely disappeared at Green Bay) and Eli Manning is sharper, which says a lot considering the number of big-time throws he made back in Week 10. San Franciscoâs secondary matches up well with the Giants’ receiving corps. Carlos Rogers can stay with Victor Cruz in the slot (he did last game â and he also had two interceptions). Tarell Brown and Chris Culliver both do an excellent job at simultaneously reading the receiver and quarterback â noteworthy considering that Manning is willing to take chances throwing into tight coverage. The athleticism of inside linebackers NaVorro Bowman and Patrick Willis should render tight end Jake Ballard close to moot, while the collective quickness of the Niners D-line will make it tough for the Giants to run outside or execute screens. The deciding factor will be whether Manning can continue to conjure big plays. Advantage: 49ers 49ers O vs. Giants D In Week 10, the 49ers surprised the Giants by frequently throwing on first down. They also took advantage of the Giants’ limitations at linebacker after Michael Boley was lost to injury. But this is a healthier, livelier Giants defense. San Franciscoâs issues in pass protection could resurface in a costly way. The Niners will almost certainly keep extra backs and tight ends in to help block. That means Alex Smith will be throwing into a more crowded defense with fewer targets. Thus, heâll have to make quick, sharp decisions after the snap, as opposed to last week, when the Saintsâ man coverage and sellout blitzes allowed Smith to make decisions before the snap. Solid as Smith has been this season (and especially down the stretch), decision-making from a muddied pocket is not his forte. Look for the 49ers to focus intently on running the ball â especially if the Giants line up with three safeties and two linebackers against base offensive personnel (something they may do in an effort to get Antrel Rolle matched on Vernon Davis). Itâs not enough for the Niners to simply establish the run â they must control the game with it.
