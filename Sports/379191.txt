Advertisement  Say what you will, but when you hire ELDRIDGE WYATT as a security guard, don't expect him to stand there with his hands on his hips when he spots a flagrant breach of the peace. That became apparent on Tuesday night when Wyatt, an off-duty Oklahoma City police officer hired to provide security at a high school basketball game, witnessed what he believed was assaultive behavior, and right there on the court, too. Wyatt knew his duty and did it. He marched onto the court and berated Referee STAN GUFFEY for ignoring flagrant elbowing by two of the players. When Guffey told Wyatt he had no business interfering, Wyatt placed the referee under arrest and pushed him off the court. After a 10-minute meeting between the police and game and conference officials, Wyatt agreed to let the matter drop and the game resumed. After the incident was reported in the local paper, the Oklahoma City police department began an internal investigation.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
