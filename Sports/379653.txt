DALLAS â Gil Brandt, the former longtime vice president for player personnel for the Cowboys, has been to 42 of 44 Super Bowls. And he believes Super Bowl XLV is as closely matched as any of them. In fact, when asked for a prediction, Brandt said this would be the first Super Bowl that went to overtime. âAs you look at this whole thing, itâs too close to call,â he said. âIf you look at it statistically, itâs too close to call.â Then Brandt, who writes for NFL.com and serves as an analyst for Sirius Radio, started listing the statistics. He said the Steelers posted 48 sacks this season, and the Packers 47. Points allowed: 240 for Green Bay, 232 for Pittsburgh. Points scored: advantage, Green Bay, by 13.

Brandt kept going. He said that in the 44 previous Super Bowls, the younger quarterback won 22 times, same as the older. He said this Super Bowl marks the seventh time that two quarterbacks with ages within 10 months of each other squared off. In those games, the oldest won three times, same as the youngest. So whom does Brandt like in this game?  He said the game would be 30-30 at the end of regulation, but he liked Green Bay in overtime.
