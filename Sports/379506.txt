Rex Ryan and Hue Jackson. Two tough guys, two hard-nosed coaches. Both were assistants on the 2008 Baltimore Ravens team that lost the A.F.C. championship game to Pittsburgh. Theirs is just one of the story lines going into Sunday’s game between two franchises â the Jets and the Raiders â that have a long and rich history together.   Join the discussion with George Bretherton and Bret Leuthner tonight from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. by clicking on the box below. Listen in or call us at 480-409-3547. (Recorded show starts at the 3:15 mark)  TOPICS OF DISCUSSION 1) Is Hue Jackson taking the Raiders in the right direction? Jackson, who admits to being influenced by Ryan, is talking a big game. (Listen for yourself below)  In Rex-ian fashion, he announces that the Raiders will get it done this Sunday against the Jets. The Raiders, who may have been slowed last week against Buffalo because of quirky scheduling (traveling cross-country on short rest), figure to be fired up for their home opener. The Jets were 8-3 on the road last season, including the playoffs.  2) Is the Giants’ defense rounding into form? It didn’t look good early against the Rams on Monday. But maybe it wasn’t as bad as it seemed. The defense finished the game with three straight 3-and-outs in the fourth quarter. Rams quarterback Sam Bradford finished with a completion percentage of less than 50 percent (22 of 46, 47.8%) and the Rams’ rushing game averaged only 3.1 yards per rush. On offense, Eli Manning bounced back after throwing an early interception to throw for 2 TDs. The Eagles’ offense, with or without Michael Vick, will be a supreme test for the Giants’ defense. 3) Other issues from around the league — Can the Bills end their 15-game losing streak to the Patriots? Buffalo’s last victory came on Sept. 7, 2003, by 31-0 in Orchard Park. — Is it Carolina vs. Jacksonville or Cam Newton vs. Blaine Gabbert? Newton, the heralded No. 1 pick over all, has had a head start over Gabbert, the No. 10 over all pick, who got his first N.F.L. action in the fourth quarter of the Jaguars’ 32-3 loss to the Jets last Sunday. — In division rivalry games, can 0-2 Minnesota make a stand at home against the beastly 2-0 Lions? Other key division games include Atlanta (1-1) at Tampa Bay (1-1), Green Bay (2-0) at Chicago (1-1), Washington (2-0) at Dallas (1-1), Kansas City (0-2) at San Diego (1-1) and Arizona (1-1) at Seattle (0-2).
