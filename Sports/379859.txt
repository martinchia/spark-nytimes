Advertisement  The president of the International Olympic Committee, JUAN ANTONIO SAMARANCH, in Havana for the Pan American Games, said that Cuba will participate in the 1992 Olympics next July in Barcelona, Spain. Samaranch said that Cuban President FIDEL CASTRO had told him he would attend the inauguration ceremony for the Olympics. "I assure you, the Cuban team will be in Barcelona and President Castro will be there too," he said. Samaranch, who has been put on the hot seat about the expense that third world nations will have to pay to compete in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, defended the cost of the Games in his homeland. Yesterday, he said that room and board in Barcelona's Olympic Village will be free for all athletes and defended other costs. "The problem of prices in Barcelona does not correspond to some of the exaggerated charges that have been made," Samaranch said. "Prices for the athletes and officials are actually quite reasonable and moreover we plan to give major assistance to make things easier." "As there will be two athletes to every official the average prices per person for the national delegations will be slightly more than $33 a day," he said.
