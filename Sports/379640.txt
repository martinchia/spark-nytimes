We’re spotlighting a few reader comments from Sunday’s blog posts on the Giants-Eagles game: From Martin of Portland, Ore.: Michael Vick has returned a more complete quarterback who has regained his speed. He is by far the most dynamic player in the league. He pulled off a LeBron, Michael Jordan, Kobe taking over of a game, and the Giants reacted as if they were hit by a tornado. I think they just got beat by a phenomenal athlete in his prime who took the wind out from under their sails. Roethlesberger, when faced with a similar challenge against the Jets, looked very ordinary. These things happen and it may have ended Coughlin’s tenure with the Giants, although his entire team reacted  like a boxer who was way ahead on points but walked into a punch he didn’t see coming and got knocked out. This is what is great about professional level sports. Ashley Fox of The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that Vick has already earned her M.V.P. vote.
