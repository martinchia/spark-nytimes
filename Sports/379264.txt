Mexico is out. Colombia is out. And most Latin American nations were never in. When it comes to women’s soccer around the world, many people in Hispanic countries view (and will for a long time) the sport as a man’s game. Period. Full stop. Mexico was eliminated in its final game of the group stage on Tuesday. Colombia, already ousted after two losses to open its play in Group C of the Women’s World Cup in Germany, will have its last chance to salvage a point or 3 against North Korea on Wednesday. “Colombia is one of the countries that doesn’t have a professional league, and most of the players have jobs or go to school,” said Claudia Trejos, a studio anchor for the UnivisiÃ³n/GalavisiÃ³n Spanish-language coverage of the tournament. “All of these things takes away from their preparation.  “It all takes away from their preparations. Growing up in Colombia, I can tell you first hand that soccer is not the first thing parents want you to do. But now with the World Cup, there is a path to the top and it is growing for the women. But still, the support is not there, and I don’t mean government support. We just don’t have the structure you have in the States.” Mexico has shown some promise with a roster heavy with players who either play in college in the United States or have dual citizenship, especially since the former Mexico international Leo Cuellar took over as the team’s coach. Colombia, too, has a male coach in Ricardo Rozo, but he has far less talent than Cuellar to work with. Mexico and Colombia were the only two qualifiers from Latin America (Brazil does not count) for the Women’s World Cup. A traditional power in the men’s game like Argentina remains light years behind the countries of North America and Europe in accepting, let alone supporting, a women’s program. “It has been a battle, a concept that goes across the borders in the Anglo and Hispanic world,” Trejos said. “But it’s a battle I think we’ve won, meaning our female gender. We have always looked at Brazil and Argentina, Pele and Maradona, but now we have female versions in players like Abby Wambach and Marta. But this has not been an overnight success. It’s been a decade in the making.” Do you think the women’s game is gaining adherents in the Hispanic world?
