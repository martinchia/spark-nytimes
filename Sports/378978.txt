Most of Jurgen Klinsmann’s first-choice players have games in Europe this weekend, so he will run out the best of his B and C list on Saturday night for a friendly against Venezuela in Glendale, Ariz. (8:09 p.m. | Updated With Lineups, Below) Consider it an open audition of sorts. Klinsmann called in an M.L.S.-heavy roster for Saturday’s game, Wednesday’s friendly in Panama and the weeks-long training camp that preceded them. Part of that was to keep in the good graces of the European coaches; Saturday is not an official FIFA match day, so they would not be obligated to release players like Landon Donovan, Clint Dempsey and Timmy Chandler to him anyway. (Klinsmann will call in his A team for the Feb. 29 friendly against Italy in Genoa.)  When he was hired last summer, one of the first things Klinsmann made clear was that he wanted the players to feel as if they were fighting for their places every time the team got together. He reinforced that by telling them that his plan was to develop a starter and a backup at each position, and have them fight it out for their role in every practice. (Nothing would please him more, no doubt, than to find out that his European-based pros stayed up late â or got up very early â to keep an eye on things in Glendale.) So what Klinsmann is doing this month is twofold: he is giving some M.L.S. players a chance to get into camp with him and see what he expects of them. But he is also getting a look at them, seeing if there is anything out there he can use. Some players take advantage of this; Brek Shea is a good example of what he can find. Others do not, and may never get called in again. So when you sit down to watch Saturday (either on ESPN3 or Galavision), pay attention to players who may be getting their first look â it could be a big moment for defender A. J. De La Garza, midfielder Graham Zusi, and forwards Teal Bunbury and C. J. Sapong. All but Bunbury could be making their debuts for the national team. Also for a striker like Chris Wondolowski, who has had scattered (brief) looks from Klinsmann. The forwards, especially, could help themselves. The national team has famously struggled to score under Klinsmann, so if he can find someone who can put the ball in the net they might force their way into the picture going into qualifying this summer. They’re not going to take the jobs of Dempsey and Jozy Altidore, certainly not yet, but there could be a place for them if they can provide a spark. Remember how fast Charlie Davies and Juan Agudelo â who is injured and will not play â rose in the picture several years ago by flashing their skills and scoring prowess. All they needed was a chance. Who would you like to see, and see do well, against Venezuela? Check back later for lineups and after the game for John Godfrey’s player ratings. Jurgen Klinsmann appears set to go with a 4-2-3-1 against Venezuela, with Teal Bunbury alone up front and Jermaine Jones as the captain. Bet you didn’t expect that, did you? The lineup: Bill Hamid; A.J. DeLaGarza, Michael Parkhurst, Geoff Cameron, Heath Pearce; Jeff Larentowicz, Jermaine Jones (capt.); Graham Zusi, Benny Feilhaber, Brek Shea; Teal Bunbury Feilhaber is the dean of this group, with 38 caps, but Pearce has 33. Everyone else has fewer than 10. Hamid, Zusi and DeLaGarza are getting their first. Follow Andrew Das on Twitter.
