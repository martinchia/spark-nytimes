Advertisement  Giles Brophy, one of the three feuding owners of Strike the Gold, winner of the Kentucky Derby last year, removed Nick Zito as trainer of his race horses yesterday. But Zito will remain as the trainer of Strike the Gold, also owned by Bill Condren and Joe Cornaccia, who have said repeatedly that Zito would train their star colt despite the owners' legal battle over control of the horse. Brophy, a broker in Government securities, said that Phil Johnson would take over as trainer of his personal stable of four horses in training at Gulfstream Park in Florida and would pick up five juveniles in the spring and take them to New York. "Nick is a terrific trainer," Brophy said. "But it seemed to me that a change at this time would do us all good." Zito, a 44-year-old New Yorker, won national acclaim last spring when Strike the Gold won the Blue Grass Stakes and the Kentucky Derby. But the colt, a son of Alydar, has lost eight races in a row since then. And his three owners have become locked in lawsuits, with Condren and Cornacchia deposing Brophy as managing partner and Brophy in turn suing them for outright control of Strike the Gold.
