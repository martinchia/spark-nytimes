3:43 p.m. | Updated In a closed door meeting with Brian Earley, the United States Open tournament referee, two former champions, Rafael Nadal and Andy Roddick, and the 2008 runner-up, Andy Murray, expressed concerns about the playing conditions being dangerous when they were asked to start their fourth-round matches Wednesday.  The rain had been reduced to a mist when they were called onto their respective courts. It would intensify less than an hour later, causing another suspension.      âWe just wanted to say if the conditions are similar, if you put us out there it might turn into a bit of a problem,â Roddick said, adding, âHe was very understanding. He certainly wasnât angry for us coming in there.â   The playersâ matches were held over from Tuesday when a steady rain washed out the dayâs action. When play was suspended a few minutes before 1 p.m. on Wednesday, Nadal, the defending champion, was trailing Gilles Muller 3-0 on Arthur Ashe Stadium; Roddick was beating David Ferrer 3-1 on Louis Armstrong; and Murray was behind 2-1 to Donald Young on the Grandstand Court.  Before Roddickâs match began, he pointed out standing water in the back of the court to the chair umpire, Carlos Bernardos, and told him the lines were slippery.   âI was just wondering if he saw the same mist I was,â Roddick said, adding, âI understand everyone wants to see it on TV. At the end of the day, weâre a sport, weâre entertainment, and this is a business. At the same time, you have to be safe with it. They may have jumped the gun a little bit.â In the mid-afternoon, the U.S.T.A. released this statement: âAll parties, including the players and tournament, want to get the U.S. Open back on schedule. As of 12 noon today, the best information available to us indicated the chance of a two-hour window without rain. Unfortunately, not all light rain and mist shows up on the radar. We have experienced referees, and they decide if courts are fit to play. Conditions may be not ideal, but they still can be safe. However, if a player or players feel that conditions are unsafe, we listen to them, as we have always done, and the referee uses that information as part of his/her assessment on whether to continue or halt play.â   Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
