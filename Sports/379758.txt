WASHINGTON — The Connecticut junior point guard Kemba Walkerâs N.B.A. stock rises a bit more with each dominant performance. In the Huskiesâ 81-52 win over Bucknell in their opening game of the N.C.A.A. tournament Thursday, Walker had 18 points, 12 assists and 8 rebounds. On Friday, as the No. 3-seeded Huskies prepared for their third-round game against No. 6 Cincinnati, Walker sounded like a player who could be playing in his final N.C.A.A. tournament. âThis could possibly be our last game of the season,â Walker said. âI donât want it to end. Iâm just trying to cherish every moment, just trying to enjoy the moment.â When asked if Connecticutâs final game this season would also be the final one of his college career, Walker said he did not know, but he acknowledged that his strong play would only help him. âIâm just trying to win games, and the better I do, the better my situation will be,â Walker said. âItâs not really a big thing in my head. Iâm just playing ball.â
