 Like Arron Asham two months earlier, Artem Anisimov momentarily lost his way in the middle of an intense hockey game. After knocking down Washingtonâs Jay Beagle in a fight on Oct. 14, Asham gestured like he had put Beagle to sleep. After scoring a goal in the second period Thursday to give the Rangers a 2-1 lead, the usually reserved Anisimov pretended to fire his stick toward the Tampa Bay net.  Just as Asham apologized within minutes of the conclusion of his game, calling his actions âclassless,â Anisimov apologized to his teammates. Rangers Coach John Tortorella went into protect mode for his young player from Russia. âHeâs a great kid,â Tortorella said of Anisimov. âI donât think he realized what would happen in that type of situation. And I donât think that was planned by him to go that far.  Itâs a lesson learned pretty quickly.â Asham was not suspended or fined by the N.H.L., and Anisimov probably won’t be either. Tortorella did not make Anisimov available to the news media after the game, but he promised his remorseful player would speak publicly after practice Friday afternoon.  Anisimov knows he messed up, and he paid a price Thursday night. His gesture motivated the Lightning, winless in their last five games and down by two goals Thursday, to come back and beat the Rangers.
