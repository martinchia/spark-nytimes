The last time the Detroit Tigers played in the postseason, in 2006, starting pitcher Justin Verlander was viewed as a possible star of the future. The wild card Tigers started that playoff run against the heavily-favored Yankees, and found a way to win, 3-1. That started a roll that lasted until the World Series, where the Tigers stumbled and won one game against the Cardinals. Now, five years later, Verlander has emerged as one of the best pitchers in baseball and leads the Tigers into the 2011 playoffs. And yes, the Yankees are waiting again. This time, the American League Central champion Tigers feel more confident, partially thanks to their pitching prowess. “I’m pretty sure someone said we had no shot (in 2006),” Tigers third baseman Brandon Inge told the Detroit News. “I’m pretty sure they’re not going to say that this time. The postseason is a whole different beast. It’s going to be about who gets on fire the quickest and stays consistent. Obviously on paper we have a great shot. But they have a good team, too.” Verlander headlines the Tigers’ rotation, and will start Fridayâs Game 1 against the Yankees in New York. The Tigers carry a strong starting rotation, as do the Yankees, into the series. The Yankees are No. 5 in the American League, the Tigers seventh, based on E.R.A. Yankees starters are 71-45, with a 4.03 E.R.A. The Tigers are right there, with a 72-47 record and 4.10 E.R.A.

Tigers Manager Jim Leyland, have not officially set the rotation or playoff roster, but it appears that right-hander Verlander will be followed by Doug Fister for Game 2 in New York, Max Scherzer in Game 3 and Rick Porcello for Game 4 in Detroit.  Verlander is the only starter with playoff experience, carrying a 1-2 record and 5.82 E.R.A. from the 2006 run. Verlander appeared once against the Yankees in the 2006 series, helping the Tigers win, 4-3, in Game 2 at Yankee Stadium. He threw 5.1 innings, with seven hits, three earned runs, four walks and five strikeouts. Verlander, 28, will be the brightest star on the mound this time, carrying potential Cy Young and even A.L. MVP-quality numbers: a 24-5 record, 2.40 E.R.A., and 250 strikeouts. Heâs equally strong at home as on the road: with a 10-3 record and 2.37 E.R.A. at Comerica Park, and 14-2 and 2.43 E.R.A. away from Detroit. This season, Verlander has faced the Yankees twice — once at home, once away — and had no decision in either game. He uncharacteristically struggled, allowing eight walks, a .250 batting average in 12 innings. Fister (11-13) was acquired by the Tigers on July 30 from the Mariners, and has gone 8-1 since. He was named the A.L. pitcher of the month for September. He only has one appearance this year against the Yankees, a 4-1 loss in New York in his last start for the Mariners.  Scherzer, the third starter, is known for his success pitching at Comerica Park -â which is why he will likely be starting Game 3 in Detroit. Scherzer is 8-4, with a 3.80 E.R.A. in Detroit, and 7-5 with a 5.23 E.R.A. on the road.  Curiously, the Yankees are the exception to Scherzerâs season numbers. He is 2-0 against them, with both wins at Yankee Stadium. Heâs carrying a 4.15 E.R.A., highlighted by a 4-0, four-hit gem tossed on May 4 in New York. Porcello, 22, rounds out the rotation. Heâs been starting for the Tigers since 2009, showing the confidence Leyland has in the young pitcher. His numbers are the opposite of Scherzer, as Porcello (14-9) has been stronger on the road in 2011. Heâs 5-5 at Comerica Park, with a 5.64 E.R.A. and 9-4, with a 4.00 E.R.A. in away games. Porcello hasnât pitched at Yankee Stadium this year, but beat the Yankees, 1-0, at Comerica Park on May 5.
