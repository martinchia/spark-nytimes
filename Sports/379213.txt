To say that the Red Bulls are lurching from one underachieving soccer area of Europe to another for their top management â the Scottish are replacing the Scandinavians â would be an understatement. But, Jack Bell writes in Sunday’s Times, the franchise needs to do something — again — to try to turn itself around. Goal, The New York Times soccer blog, will report on news and features from the world of soccer and around the Web.  Times editors and reporters will follow international tournaments and provide analysis of games. There will be interviews with players, coaches and notable soccer fans, as well as a weekly blog column by Red Bulls forward Jozy Altidore.  Readers can discuss Major League Soccer, foreign leagues and other issues with fellow soccer fans.
