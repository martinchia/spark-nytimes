The members of the Mets front office will head to Dallas this weekend for the baseballâs winter meetings with their priorities in this still-developing free agent market unchanged since September. The Mets bullpen, which floundered last season, remains the most pressing need. And Jose Reyes, of course, looms large. On both fronts, though, the Mets seem to be in no great hurry to act. âThe reliever market right now is a little bit hard to predict,â general manager Sandy Alderson said Thursday afternoon. âThe signings that have taken place so far I think have emboldened agents to this point.â For instance, Jonathan Papelbon signed a four-year, $50 million contract with the Phillies last month. Earlier this week, the Royals signed Jonathan Broxton on a one-year, $4 million deal to be their setup man. But Alderson implied the Mets had no need to panic, considering the surplus of options still available on the market and the relative absence of serious buyers.  He said, âI think there are plenty of relievers out there, and itâs not clear to me there are plenty of landing spots, certainly not plenty of landing sports for the big-ticket relievers maybe looking to close.â  The market for Reyes, too, remains murky. After the Florida Marlins made a splash with an early round of courtship, Alderson said the Mets would have more discussions with Peter Greenberg, Reyesâ agent, in the coming days. But he claimed for now to be only as informed on the issue as the average fan. âAs far as the market for Jose is concerned, I only know what I read in the paper,â Alderson said. Alderson speculated that the uncertainty over the new collective bargaining agreement had slowed the free agent market this offseason and that once a few high-profile players signed with teams, setting market values, more could quickly follow.  Beyond their most pressing needs, the Mets are also looking to find role players â ideally ones that can play catcher or second base â to fill their bench. The Mets have a few gaps to fill after bench players like Jason Prydie and Nick Evans signed as free agents this fall with other clubs. One player that is not on their radar, contrary to some reports that surfaced online Thursday, is Jorge Posada. âIâve had no communication with the agent,â said Alderson, who went on to call any scenario in which Posada would end up a Met âunlikely.â The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
