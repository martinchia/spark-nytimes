Why is there such intrigue surrounding United States Coach Bob Bradleyâs recent roster selection for his team’s matches against Argentina and Paraguay? These are just friendlies, right? Two 90-minute exhibitions featuring a bunch of international players kicking it around for a while, trying not to get injured and then trading jerseys and hugs afterward. No big deal, right? Wrong. For one thing, the March 26 match against Argentina and the Paraguay game three days later represent the first time the United States has gathered its “A” team since last Octoberâs 2-2 tie against Poland. So these two matches provide a wonderful opportunity to see how Bradley views his current player pool. More important, these two matches are the final ones before the United States gathers to prepare for the 2011 Concacaf Gold Cup. Since the winner of the Gold Cup gains entry into the prestigious Confederations Cup in Brazil in 2013, Bradley and his players desperately want to win it. The players called up to face Argentina and Paraguay will be fighting to prove they deserve a roster spot in the Gold Cup. That should bring a welcome level of competition and passion to both games. Given that backdrop, here is a look at the ins and outs of the U.S. soccer roster selection, with an eye toward this summerâs Gold Cup, the 2013 Confederations Cup and beyond.

In: The strike force of the future
Out: Kenny Cooper, Herculez Gomez, Eddie Johnson, Chris Wondolowski Want to make an American soccer fan scowl? Just say the word striker and watch his face start contorting. Whether lamenting the one who got away (Giuseppe Rossi), the one who got injured (Charlie Davies) or the one who failed to live up to the hype (Freddy Adu), American attacking options have been a source of consternation for years. But that could change very quickly with the emergence of two young stars: Juan Agudelo and Teal Bunbury. Bunbury, 21, is recovering from an elbow injury and will miss both friendlies, but the fact that Bradley named the 18-year-old Agudelo to the roster brings hope to United States supporters. Yes, there are American strikers currently playing in top leagues who have scored more goals and have more experience than Agudelo — Cooper, Wondolowski, Gomez, etc. But Agudelo has the It factor that is so hard to define and still harder to find.  The thought of having Agudelo pair up with 21-year-old Jozy Altidore up front is downright exciting. Add Bunbury to the mix and a sense of giddiness emerges. And if Davies, who scored two goals in his MLS debut on Saturday, can return to his pre-accident form, the U.S. strike force may become a source of pride. In: Eight midfielders
Out: DaMarcus Beasley, Alejandro Bedoya, JosÃ© Torres There is tremendous competition for roster spots in the midfield, the team’s deepest position. And it should be fascinating to see who does what in the center of the field against these South American opponents. Will Michael Bradley start over Jermaine Jones and Maurice Edu despite limited playing time with his new club team, Aston Villa? Will Landon Donovan play inside or outside, or up top? Can Mikkel Diskerud fit in with the veterans? But what does it mean for a midfielder when Bob Bradley calls in eight players at the position and you are not one of them? Well, it is not good. While it is true that Beasley possesses a Hannover jersey â he wears No. 16 for those of you keeping score at home â and draws a salary from the Bundesligaâs third-place team, it would be a bit of a stretch to say he actually plays for the squad. Beasley has logged only four appearances this season, all as a substitute, for a miniscule 65 minutes of action. His exclusion from Bradley’s roster for the coming games is due largely to his club-level inactivity. (Note to DMB: Ready to return to M.L.S.?) Bedoya is not in midseason form either, but that is because his team, Orebro of the Swedish Allsvenskan, plays a spring-to-autumn schedule â much like M.L.S. Bedoyaâs rustiness, combined with his lackluster showing against Brazil last August, probably prevented him from receiving serious consideration. Torres, on the other hand, is seeing plenty of playing time for his Mexican Primera Division squad, Pachuca. A small-yet-skillful 23-year-old midfielder, he has never really fit into Bradleyâs system, and his exclusion from the roster may be a sign the he does not fit into the teamâs long-term plans. In: Two dual-citizenship Germans
Out: One permanent U.S. resident Honduran The United States national team provides a wonderful opportunity for certain dual-citizenship athletes. Quality players from soccer-mad countries like Germany face an uphill battle to earn a roster spot for their highly competitive national teams, but if they can secure an American passport they often can find an easier path to an international roster spot. Bradley has named two such players to his squad, and both look to make their United States debuts against Argentina or Paraguay. The more exciting of the two is Timothy Chandler, a 20-year-old who starts for Nuremberg in the Bundesliga. Chandler, the son of a German mother and an American military father, has played all over the field during his young career but is listed as a defender on Bradley’s roster. Young, fast, smart and full of potential, Chandler should challenge for playing time immediately. The 29-year-old goalkeeper David Yelldell also has a German mother and an American military father. A veteran of the Bundesliga 2 who currently plays for MSV Duisburg, the 6-foot-4 Yelldell does not have the most compelling resume but his official Web site is top flight. It is also worth pointing out that dual-citizenship players from countries who rarely qualify for the World Cup could base their international allegiance on improving their odds of playing in the World Cup. Next up on this front: Andy Najar. The 17-year-old Honduras-born attacker and 2010 M.L.S. Rookie of the Year moved to the United States when he was 13 and is openly weighing his options. (Najar is not yet a citizen and is therefore not yet eligible to play for the United States, but he is on Bradleyâs radar screen.) He stands to see more international playing time if he chooses Honduras, but he has a much better chance of playing on soccerâs biggest stage if he ultimately sides with the U.S. In: Eric Lichaj
Out: Three players with last-minute injuries Three players initially named to the roster were removed from the squad Sunday, creating a few gaps in the lineup and a chance for Leeds United right back Eric Lichaj. Hannover captain and right back Steve Cherundolo is dealing with a groin issue, Norwich City defender Zak Whitbread is nursing a sore back, and Bolton midfielder Stuart Holden was on the receiving end of a vicious tackle in Saturdayâs match against Manchester United. As a result, all three will miss out on these two friendly matches. Lichaj gets the nod at their expense. Additionally, right before the rosters were announced, Brondby central defender Clarence Goodson was eliminated from consideration with a broken toe. Since making his debut with the national team against Sweden in 2008, Goodson has established himself as a reliable option in central defense and was no doubt on Bradleyâs short list. His injury most likely opened a roster spot for Whitbread, who has been on the outside looking in for years. But because of his shoulder issue, Whitbread will have to wait a little bit longer. In: New challengers to Tim Howard
Out: Brad Guzan The English Premier Leagueâs official Web site lists Evertonâs Howard as the ninth-best goalkeeper in the league. The New Jersey native is very good, no doubt about it, but how do you keep Howard on his toes and ensure that he is always pushing to perform at the highest level? Perhaps by leaving the perennial backup Brad Guzan off the roster and bringing two different goalkeepers into camp. Guzan, who sees lots of playing time for Hull City in Englandâs second-tier division, always seems to be part of the U.S. roster but does not seem to challenge Howardâs starting role. For these two friendlies, Bradley left Guzan off the team in favor of Wolverhampton’s Marcus Hahnemann and the first-time callup Yelldell. Maybe this change of pace will inject a bit more competition into camp and prompt Howard to keep pushing himself. What do you think of the roster selections? Encouraged and hopeful?
