 Under ordinary circumstances Steve Kean surely would have been grateful for the timing of this weekâs international break. Slumped just a point and a position above the bottom of the Premier League table — with just a single league win so far this season, against Arsenal of all teams — Kean was subject to a particularly vociferous protest of his continued employment from fans of his team, Blackburn Rovers, after Saturdayâs 4-0 defeat to Manchester City. With the final round of international fixtures this year to be played next week, Kean could have found solace in the opportunity to regroup and orchestrate a recovery before Blackburn’s next game, at QPR on Oct. 15. But he was denied that chance, instead being forced to adhere to the commercial wishes of the clubâs owners, the chicken meat processors Venkyâs, by flying his team 7,000 miles for a tour of India. Having postponed a preseason trip to India after three bomb attacks in the countryâs financial capital, Mumbai, Venkyâs rescheduled the six-day trip for this week, with the squad arriving Monday for what has been labeled a goodwill visit. The trip will also include a friendly against Pune FC.  Kean and the players could not have been pleased with the trip, and itâs easy to understand their grievances. Rather than attempt to find a solution to their dismal league form on the training ground, Rovers will now spend more time trying to tighten the zippers on its travel luggage than tightening its leaky back line. But rather than openly criticize the decision by Venkyâs to fly the team to the other side of the globe for a meaningless friendly match, Kean has put a positive spin on the inconvenience, going so far as to claim he is pleased to be heading to India. âWe wanted to be the first Premier League club to play in India,” he said. “There isnât any other time we couldâve done it. The international players will go away, but there are still lots of players available who will go and they will enjoy the experience of seeing the football hysteria out there. âObviously we didnât think weâd be in this position when we arranged it, but it is still a good opportunity to go and train in a different environment. Itâs going to be a good time because most of the players are going to be together for five or six days and I think that will be really good. âThis trip has come at the perfect time.â The appetite for soccer has undoubtedly grown in the East since the hosting of the World Cup in Japan and South Korea in 2002, and the involvement of Venkyâs with a Premier League club will serve to further increase the popularity of the sport in a cricket-dominated landscape. However, while preseason tours of lucrative markets may have benefits, a trip midway through the season — and at such a crucial time in Blackburnâs case — indicates a severe lack of sporting, and even commercial, understanding from the clubâs owners. Roversâ biggest asset as a commercial proposition is its current status as Premier League club. Without that title they risk losing their new supporters to the leagueâs elite clubs. The Asian influence at a Premier League club makes it an attractive option to new fans in the East, but relegation would be disastrous. And thatâs what makes Venkyâs decision to embark on an energy sapping and ill-timed trip appear reckless. Rovers may sell some extra shirts and merchandise, but the decision could have bigger implications. On Saturday, about three hundred fans staged a postmatch protest by unfurling a large “Kean Out” banner. If the team’s owners damage the club by making a quick buck at the teamâs expense, they wonât have to wait long to see a “Venkyâs Out” banner unfurled at Ewood Park.
