The Yankeesâ loss on Saturday to the Texas Rangers did more than send the American League Championship Series back to the Bronx tied at one game each. It also pushed down the price of tickets to Game 3.  The average price of tickets for resale to Game 3 at Yankee Stadium on Monday was $250, 9.5 percent less than before the Yankees lost, according to FanSnap.com, a ticket resale search engine. Ticket prices to Games 4 and 5, which will also be at Yankee Stadium, fell by smaller amounts. The price of tickets for resale typically fall as game time approaches, but not often this fast, unless something drastic happens  â a team is suddenly knocked out of playoff contention or a key player is injured. Ticket prices also fall when there are too many tickets on the market and not enough buyers, or because some tickets were initially priced too high. Still, the Philliesâ loss in Game 1 to the Giants on Saturday night did not seem to dampen prices for Game 2, which will be played Sunday night in Philadelphia. The average offer price for a ticket was $350 on Sunday, up slightly from $345 before Game 1 on Saturday.
