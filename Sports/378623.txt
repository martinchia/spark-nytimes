9:14 p.m. | Updated  Bradley signed his contract with the Egyptian federation on Thursday and to CNN Arabic: âI know Egyptian fans are eager to watch their national team in World Cup action after a lengthy absence. Egyptian Football Association chairman Samir Zaher talked to me about that and stressed that playing in the World Cup represents the main objective. Iâm sure I can fulfil it. âI know that thereâs a big difference between Egyptian and American players. The Americans are more professional than their Egyptian counterparts, but the Egyptians are more talented. âI have been following the Egyptian national team since the Confederations Cup. I know they have very good abilities, which helped them win the Nations Cup three times on the trot.â If it is not yet official, then Bob Bradley took a long airplane ride for nothing. The former coach of the United States national team, Chivas USA, the MetroStars and the Chicago Fire touched down in Cairo early Wednesday, where he is expected to sign a contract to take over as coach of Egypt’s national team. According to AhramOnline, Bradley had been expected to arrive in Egypt on Tuesday, but was delayed by what it called ticketing problems. Bradley, 53, is expected to takeover from Hassan Shehata, who led the Pharaohs, as Egypt’s team is known, to three consecutive Africa Nations Cup titles. But Egypt failed to qualify for the 2012 tournament and Bradley’s task will be to build a team in preparation for qualifying matches for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. News media reports began circulating over the weekend that Bradley had reached an agreement to take the job in Egypt. Nothing was official, however, as some people close to Bradley said the deal had yet to be completed. What can Bradley expect in his new position? How quickly can a Princeton man learn Arabic?
