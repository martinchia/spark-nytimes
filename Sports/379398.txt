For a lot of golfers, the late summer and approaching fall is the best time to play. Itâs less crowded and the air is crisper. A personal choice of mine is to head for the hills, where the foliage and scenery enhance every round. But if you play where there are elevation changes, you will find yourself with a lot of sidehill and downhill lies off the tee. If you are faced with this situation, the golf magazines and instruction manuals will tell you to aim more to the left when the ball is below your feet (for a right-handed golfer) and to aim more to the right if the ball is above your feet. Dan Spooner, the director of golf at the Leatherstocking Golf Course in Cooperstown, N.Y., has been a P.G.A. pro for more than 30 years. He has spent his career teaching students how to play off the uneven lies so common to golf courses in Central New York. And he thinks itâs a mistake to aim too far left or right off those lies. âItâs far more important to make sure you have good balance over the ball and to maintain that balance during the swing,â Spooner said. âBend your knees and secure your footing. Then, I find that your subconscious takes over and makes the correction needed to hit it straight so long as your body remains in a good position. âHow many times have you seen a golfer aim way left when the ball is below his feet, then hit it straight at that spot on the left? He will complain, âThatâs not whatâs supposed to happen.â Well, maybe it is whatâs supposed to happen. If you go out there and practice those shots â which is a good idea â most of them donât fade or draw as much as you think.â Hereâs my take on those shots in the mountains and valleys: Even if the result isnât perfect, you still have a great view.
