 The United States enjoyed a bounty of variety Tuesday night when the men’s under-20 national team opened regional qualifying for the world championships with a 4-0 win against Suriname in Estadio Nacional Mateo Flores in Guatemala City in which the goals were scored by four different players. The United States was led by Kelyn Rowe and Conor Doyle with a goal and an assist each, while Bobby Wood and Joe Gyau each added a goal. The Americans are in a three-team group with Suriname and Panama, which it plays on Saturday (8 p.m. Eastern, to be broadcast on ESPN Deportes and ESPN3.com). The top two teams in each of the four first-round groups advance to the quarterfinals. The four quarterfinal winners all qualify for the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Colombia. (If, however, Guadaloupe should end up winning a quarterfinal match, the quarterfinal loser with the best overall record would advance because Guadaloupe is not an official member of FIFA.) The winner of the U.S. group would advance to play either Honduras, Jamaica or the host nation in the quarterfinals.

âThe first game of a tournament where there is a lot at stake is never an easy one,â U.S. Coach Thomas Rongen said in a statement. âI think we applied ourselves quite well under the circumstances and there are still areas of improvement. Three points was important so that was our aim and within that we tried to accomplish a few other things. We wanted to keep the shutout, which we did obviously. We tried to find the rhythm and I was very pleased with the way we started. Weâre not necessarily pleased in some areas of the game where we took the foot off the pedal a little bit and relaxed a little bit too much and didnât play to the level that I think weâre capable of playing.â The U.S. is attempting to qualify for an eighth-consecutive FIFA Under-20 World Cup. The Red Bulls executive Erik Soler on Juan Agudelo
âIâve been in soccer as a professional, player, manager for 33 years. I want to say the same words that the U.S. goalie [Tim Howard] said. Heâs seen a lot of Agudelos come by and be gone again. We only have one agenda at Red Bull. That is to take care of Juan Agudelo, develop Juan Agudelo over the next years. Make sure he doesnât go anywhere too early, or go to the wrong spot. He has a great place to be here. He has a great coach, and heâs got people like Rafa Marquez and Thierry Henry that can tell him what itâs all about it in the bigger world. For us, the long term is important. We think he has talent, and that he can develop that talent, but weâre not going to tell anyone that heâs a star. Heâs a young player, playing good soccer at times. He needs time, and weâre going to give him a lot of time.â In addition to his recent play in two senior international matches, Agudelo remains eligible to play for the U.S. under-20 national team should it qualify for this year’s world championship. Wither SuperLiga
Several years ago Major League Soccer succeeded in fending off competition from ChampionsWorld to stage international matches in North America during the summer. The driving force behind ChampionsWorld, the former MetroStars executive Charlie Stillitano, was outmaneuvered and outspent by M.L.S. and its marketing company, Soccer United Marketing. But Stillitano bounced back with the Creative Artists Agency, building a soccer portfolio that is second to none in the United States. Last year, C.A.A. staged the World Football Challenge. And this year it is back in a big way with Manchester United, Barcelona, M.L.S. clubs and more announcements expected. So it seems like turnabout is fair play that the WFC has put an M.L.S.-created tournament, SuperLiga (a tournament involving four teams from M.L.S. and four from the Mexican league), out of business. âThis is a transition,â Garber told MLSsoccer.com at Red Bull Arena, where he attended an all-star news conference featuring Manchester Unitedâs Alex Ferguson on Tuesday. âSuperLiga was a great tournament which served its purpose during its time. âConcacaf got more and more committed to a continental tournament with the Champions League, which weâre very supportive of. It has delivered the value we intended [in SuperLiga] to put our teams against the best competition in this region.â Hall of Fame
Cobi Jones, Earnie Stewart and Eddie Pope have been elected to the National Soccer Hall of Fame’s Class of 2011. Voting by the Hall’s veterans committee led to the election of Bruce Murray, and Bob Gansler, who was elected on the Builders ballot. The induction ceremony will be held this summer. Date and location have yet to be determined. Downs Joins N.A.S.L.
David Downs, a former executive at ABC Sports and Univision, and most recently the executive director of the failed United States bid to host the 2022 World Cup, has signed on as the first commissioner of the North American Soccer League. âIâm excited to hit the ground running with the N.A.S.L. as we work to elevate second division soccer in North America and play an active role in taking soccer to the next level in the region,â Downs said in a statement. âWe plan to work closely with the fans, players, administrators, other leagues and everyone else involved in this beautiful game to build up the N.A.S.L. at a league and local market level.â The eight-team league’s season is scheduled to begin on April 9. “Football’s Next Star”
The Fox Soccer Channel and Inter Milan have joined forces in a new reality TV show that choose one winner from a pool of 7,000 entrants and send him to Italy on a contract with the Serie A club. The show — comprised of seven one-hour episodes — will premiere on Sunday, April 3 at 9 p.m. Eastern. The field has been whittled to 10 players who will be put through a series of skill, timing, agility and accuracy tests under the eye of Inter Coach Jose Mourinho and some of the team’s players, including Samuel Etoâo, Ivan Cordoba, Diego Milito and Javier Zanetti. Final say belongs to the technical director of Inter’s academy, Marco Monti. In a news release, FSC inadvertently released information about Manchester City’s summer tour of the United States. While saying that plans for the second season of the show will involve the English Premier League club, FSC reveals that finalists will be determined the club’s U.S. tour July 16-23, with tryouts in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
