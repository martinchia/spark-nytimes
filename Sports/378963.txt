OTTAWA â Rangers Coach John Tortorella can always find a teachable moment. Here at the N.H.L. All-Star Weekend â where he is coach of Team Alfredsson but asserts he will do nothing on the bench except âwatch, just like youâ â that moment came at Fridayâs media day, when he told reporters how much he admired Rangers defenseman Dan Girardi. âThatâs what Iâm happiest about â to see a player like that recognized,â Tortorella said ofÂ  Girardi, who leads the league in ice time and has anchored the Rangersâ climb to the top of the standings. Tortorella has spent much of the season complaining that the N.H.L. erred on the All-Star ballot by leaving off Girardi, who was never drafted and worked his way up from the minors. âI think sometimes our league forgets about people like that,â Tortorella said. âThat restores a little faith for me, that the league stepped up and when it was clear it was deserved, and gave it to him. Itâs not just pedigree, itâs what heâs done on the ice. I couldnât be happier.â Tortorella added: âHeâs a big reason why Iâm here and can talk with you today. Thatâs the highest compliment you can give him. He has turned himself into a pro.â Asked about why Girardi is so effective at blocking shots, a category in which he led the league last season and stands third now, Tortorella said, âThere is a technique that players use, but Dannyâs willingness just stands out.â Tortorella then referred to the Rangersâ overtime victory against the Bruins and Zdeno Chara last Saturday. âI watched him just two games ago against Chara in Boston, blocked two bombs by that guy,â he said. âHe comes to the bench and we think his handâs busted, and he goes out the next shift. Itâs an art, but there needs to be a willingness. He and Ryan Callahan lead the way in shot blocking.â Asked what goes through his mind as Chara winds up for a hundred-mile-an-hour slap shot, Girardi said: âThere really shouldnât be anything going through your head. You start thinking about that, thatâs when youâre going to maybe get out of the way or lean a certain way and get the shot in the wrong spot, and maybe youâre out for a while. If you just kind of walk into it, it doesnât matter whoâs shooting. It could be that big guy back on the blue line with that big black jersey shooting on you, but itâs just reaction.â Girardi said he was not always a shot-blocking fiend. He developed during his years under Jim Schoenfeld with Hartford of the American Hockey League. Schoenfeld was a top shot blocker on the Buffalo blue line during the 1970s. Girardi said he was not even a defenseman when he was growing up in Welland, Ontario. âI was a real high-skilled player in Atom and Tyke,â Girardi said. âI scored 50 one year in Atom â still got the puck at home. After a while they started coming less and less. By the time I was a Pee-Wee they said, âUm, why donât you play defense?â â Girardi won the Memorial Cup as the No. 1 defenseman with the London Knights in 2005. But after signing with the Rangers organization as a free agent, he had to move up from the minors, starting in the ECHL with the Charlotte Checkers. His development was slow but steady, and from there it was on to Hartford before he made it to the Rangers in the middle of the 2006-7 season. As Tortorella said, âItâs a great story, not being drafted but finding another avenue â a great story for a lot of people.â Girardi, who said being an All-Star was âkind of weird for me,â agreed with his coach. âItâs a great story for me and my family, coming from the East Coast League after not being drafted,â he said. âTo be at the All-Star Game with all these elite players is kind of surreal.â Girardi recalled his first encounter with Tortorella, the notoriously fiery coach who took over the Rangers in the middle of the 2008-9 season before a game in Toronto. âHe came in the first day and was talking to all the guys and kept referring to me as Joe Girardi,â who is the Yankeesâ manager, Girardi said. âIt was kind of funny because I didnât want to say anything. I knew his reputation a little bit and didnât want to step on his toes. Finally someone says, âHis name is Dan Girardi, not Joe.â And he said, âThanks for telling me after Iâve been calling him Joe.â â Tortorella has no problem remembering his name now. âHeâs a core foundation guy for us,â he said of Girardi. âIâll put him with anybody as a top defenseman in the league. The offensive part is what weâre pushing now, and heâs getting better and better at that.â On Sunday, Girardi will try to become the first Rangers defenseman to score in an All-Star Game. But given his meager numbers â 28 goals in 407 N.H.L. games â that doesnât seem likely, and his Rangers teammates let him know that. âThey hope Iâm not too far over my head,â Girardi said. âTheyâre just hoping I do O.K. out there.â What does a hardscrabble player do in a finesse-driven showcase game? âMaybe finish a few checks out there, block a few shots,â he said. âI donât know â just try to keep it under minus-2, minus-3.â Slap Shot, the New York Times hockey blog, reports on the Rangers, the National Hockey League and anything that glides quickly across a frozen surface anywhere on the globe, from the snowy prairies of Saskatchewan to the frigid steppes of Russia and beyond, like, say, Phoenix.
