Advertisement  A single preseason junior-college scrimmage more than five years ago may have cost Nebraska four of its nine 1991 victories and its share of the Big Eight championship. That was the word from Nebraska yesterday after the university concluded an internal investigation into the eligibility of Cornhusker fullback OMAR SOTO, a Miamian who was dropped from the team as a precaution a day before the Cornhuskers lost to Miami in the Orange Bowl. That move came after The Palm Beach Post suggested Soto had used up his four years of collegiate eligibility the previous season. University officials declined to discuss the findings, but The Post said it had learned that investigators had determined that Soto had in fact used up one of his four years of eligibility long before going to Nebraska as a junior-college transfer. Although Nebraska is expected to forfeit the four games it won with Soto in the lineup last year, including two against Big Eight opponents, the decision will be up to the Big Eight. If the forfeits are ordered, Nebraska's record would go from 9-1-1 to 5-5-1 and Colorado, which shared the conference title with Nebraska, will be the sole champion. Soto, who missed much of the season with a broken leg, played in only four games. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
