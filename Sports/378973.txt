 ﻿CoCo Vandeweghe of the United States beat China’s Zheng Jie, 6-2, 6-4, in the final of the Topshelf Open, a grass-court tournament in ’s-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, to claim her first WTA title. In the men’s tournament, third-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain recovered from a shaky start to beat Germany’s Benjamin Becker, 2-6, 7-6 (2), 6-4. Vandeweghe, 22, entered the tournament as a qualifier and was playing in just her second final, having lost to Serena Williams at Stanford in 2012. With Madison Keys winning in Eastbourne, it was the first time that two women from the United States had won titles in the same week since February 2002.
