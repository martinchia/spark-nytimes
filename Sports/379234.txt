Mets shortstop Jose Reyes said Saturday there was âno chanceâ that he would employ Scott Boras as his agent. Reyes, who can become a free agent after the season, spoke before a game against the Los Angeles  Angels at Citi Field, saying several times that he was happy with his current agent, Peter E. Greenberg. Reyesâs statement could be interpreted as significant because Boras, perhaps baseballâs most powerful agent, is known for taking his clients into free agency.  If Reyes tests the free-agent market, the  cash-strapped Mets may be hard-pressed to re-sign him. Foxsports.com, quoting anonymous sources, reported Friday that Boras had talked to Reyes about becoming his agent, most recently when the Mets  were in Colorado in May. Reyes said Saturday that he said hello to Boras then, âbut nothing else happened.â Reyes, 28, said he had known Greenberg and his business associates since he was a teenager. Scott Leible, an associate of Greenberg, is the godfather to two of Reyesâs children. Reyes said of Greenberg: âHe knows me. Iâm going to be honest with him. I said, âPeter, donât worry about anything. Iâm with you. Iâm happy with you. Donât think Iâm going to let you go now. Itâs not going to happen.'” The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
