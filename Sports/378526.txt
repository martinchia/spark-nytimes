With Mark Emmert, the N.C.A.A. president, coming out in favor of increasing athlete grants by $2,000, have we finally started working through the issue of student-athletes being compensated for playing college sports? Or is it the opening of Pandora’s box, deepening the competitive gulf between the larger, richer schools and the smaller, less cash-rich ones? Emmert fired up the debate Monday by testifying to the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletes, that he supported a proposal to let conferences increase grants to student-athletes by $2,000. This grant would be on top of the tuition, room and board, books, fees and other college expenses that can be covered by athletic scholarships. The Emmert-backed proposal aims to help defray expenses that athletes cannot cover themselves because they are unable to hold a part-time job because of their training and class schedules. The proposal needs to be ratified by the N.C.A.A. Board of Directors, and then will be left up to individual conferences to choose if they wish to adopt it.

Emmert said this grant increase has nothing to do with paying athletes. Officially, the N.C.A.A. does not permit payment of athletes for playing college sports.  âIâve heard a lot of people say, âWell, you want to do this $2,000 cost-of-attendance thing to reduce the probability of students breaking rules,â and thatâs nonsense,â Emmert said. âPeople break rules because they break rules.â A group of more than 300 football and men’s basketball players from major schools, such as Arizona, Purdue, Kentucky and U.C.L.A., have signed a petition aimed at the N.C.A.A., asking for a bigger share of money to enlarge scholarships to cover all the expenses of earning an undergraduate degree according to the Associated Press. An advocacy organization, called the National College Players Association, organized the petition drive. The group wants the N.C.A.A., along with the university and college presidents, to designate a portion of what they estimate is $775 million in TV revenues to boost scholarship money for football and men’s basketball players. The fund could pay for expenses in college, or if the student graduates with money still left in their allocation — they would get the remainder in cash. Emmert opposes the plan. “I really want to voice my opinions,” said the Georgia Tech red-shirt freshman defensive end Denzel McCoy, one of 55 athletes at the school to sign the petition. “The things we go through, the hours we put in, what our bodies go through, we deserve some sort of (results). College football is a billion dollar industry.” Reaction to the Emmert-backed grant increase plan is coming in from around the college sports landscape: Mississippi State Athletic Director Scott Striklin, told the Clarion-Ledger:
“Yes, this could be a big change on the national landscape and itâs one many athletic directors will support. It makes a lot of sense for a lot of reasons. âOne of the questions I have is how does this affect Pell Grants?â Stricklin said. âIs this in lieu of Pell Grant or is this in addition to the Pell Grant? A lot of student athletes get Pell Grants. “At the end of the day, anything that benefits our student athletes in an equitable way is a positive.â Michael Martin, the Louisiana State chancellor, said the proposal likely will meet with detractors at his school. âIâve got 1,400 faculty members who would love to have $2,000 more a year having gone four years without any pay raise,â Martin said. So what do you think? Is the N.C.A.A.’s idea to increase the grant by $2,000 a fair solution? Or is it going further complicate an already complex system?
