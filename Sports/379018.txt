A few leftovers from the Super Bowl: 1) “Sound FX,” a show with wired sound from many of the key participants in the Super Bowl, will be shown on the NFL Network today at 1:30 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. Eastern, and Saturday at 8 p.m. Andrew Furman of the UltimateNYG blog spotlighted this snippet from late in the game: Bill Belichick: “This is still a Cruz and Nicks game. I mean I know we’re right on them, it’s tight. But those are still the guys. Make them go to Manningham, make them go to Pascoe, all right. But let’s make sure we get Cruz and Nicks.” After Wes Welker’s crucial drop, the referee John Parry said, âWhoa, that was the game.â For other choice moments, you can see part of the video here.  2) A reader, George A of Pelham, N.Y., sent this message in the comments: I think the team with the biggest home field advantage is New Orleans. Their passing game is much better in a controlled environment, and they feed off the home crowd. If the Giants had to go thru NO this year, I don’t think they would have gone to the Super Bowl. Next year’s Super Bowl is in NO, and my pick for the SB winner next year is the Saints. Matchups can be important. The Giants had beaten New England earlier in the year, and had come very close to beating the 49ers and the Packers.
But the Saints in New Orleans? It seems the Niners did the Giants a favor. As good as the Giants were playing, do you think they could have won in the Superdome? 3) The former Patriot Rodney Harrison, now an analyst for NBC, said tight end Rob Gronkowski was out of line by celebrating publicly on the night of New England’s Super Bowl defeat.
He told ESPN Chicago 1000:  âWhen we lost the Super Bowl, any of my Super Bowl losses, I was so devastated the last thing I ever wanted to do was party, let alone dance or take off your shirt. Itâs just immaturity. Itâs not right. He made a mistake, and Iâm sure he feels absolutely stupid about it at this point. Thereâs a time and place for everything.â Extra point If Gronkowski prepared to his fullest and played to his fullest, is it anybody’s business if he enjoyed himself after the game?
