Advertisement  The way Dee Brown sees it, when you move into a new community, it's generally comforting to know it has enthusiastic police protection even if it's not quite as efficient as it might be. Brown, the first-round draft pick signed to a multiyear contract by the Boston Celtics yesterday, learned about police procedures of his new home towm first hand on Sept. 21 when the police in Wellesley, Mass., outside Boston, confronted him at gun point and forced him to the ground because he bore a surface resemblance to a man being sought for a bank robbery. Despite the indignity of the encounter and the racist overtones, Brown, who is black, has not changed his mind about living in the predominantly white upper-income community. ''I'm going to make my home in Wellesley,'' he told WBZ-TV on Friday. ''It makes me feel confident that me and my fiancee will feel safe there.'' Not that all has been forgiven. Brown's lawyer, Alan Margolies, said he was contemplating a lawsuit against the town because talks had broken down over a financial settlement for the 6-1 guard's detention and because the town had taken the position that ''racism was not a factor and that all the police procedures were proper and correct.'' The breakdown in settlement talks was news to Barbara Shanahan, the chairman of the Welleseley Board of Selectmen. ''My understanding is and always has been that we were having ongoing discussions,'' she said. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
