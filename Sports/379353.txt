As Ben Shpigel reported in “Fans at Stadium Who Waited Had Plenty of Time to Dry Off,” the Yankees expected C.C. Sabathia to throw his first pitch at Yankee Stadium on Thursday night two hours before he eventually did, at 10:32 p.m. The Yankees said a couple of weather forecasts for clearing skies turned out to be wrong, resulting in the 3-hour-27-minute rain delay to start the game. The game did not end until 1:43 a.m. Friday, when Boston’s Dan Wheeler struck out the Yankees’ Curtis Granderson. “With a large crowd present â nearly 41,000 â the Yankees were left to decide at 9:30, when the rain had finally tapered, whether the fans would rather head home after waiting so long or stick around for a late night. About 10 minutes later, it was announced that the first pitch was expected around 10:30. The announced attendance was 48,845, the largest at Yankee Stadium this season.” Besides the encouraging forecasts, the large crowd and the fact that Boston would not return to the Bronx for a potential makeup game until Sept. 23 all played into the decision. When the game finally began, the stadium seemed three-quarters full. By the time the seventh inning arrived, it was more than half-empty. At least the Yankees rewarded those fans who stuck it out, and also those who  didn’t, by offering ticket holders to Thursday night’s game free tickets to a future game. So, would you rather see a Yankees-Red Sox game that started at 10:32 p.m., or would you rather head home when the delay dragged on? Should there be a cutoff for when a rain-delayed game can start, say by 9 p.m.? For those who stayed until the bitter end, how was it getting home?
