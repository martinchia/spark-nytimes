GREENBURGH, N.Y. â Donnie Walsh and Mike DâAntoni stayed behind closed doors Monday and might remain there for some time, at least until questions about Walshâs future are settled. Walshâs contract as the Knicksâ president expires June 30 unless the team picks up his option by Saturday. James L. Dolan, the Madison Square Garden chairman, has given no hint about his intentions. He could conceivably let the option deadline pass and offer an extension later. But the franchise and Walsh will want clarity sooner, and something could be resolved this week. A report by CBSSports.com indicated that the Knicks were considering a two-year extension for Walsh and that it would be up to Walsh to decide whether to stay. A longtime friend of Walshâs indicated Monday that he thought Walsh would be retained. Walsh, who turned 70 last month, has grown testy about questions concerning his contract and his future. DâAntoni has one year left on his contract, at $6 million, but his fate could be tied to Walsh, who hired him in 2008. Amarâe Stoudemire, who signed as a free agent last summer, said he âabsolutelyâ expected both men back. Stoudemire said Walsh was âone of the main reasons why Iâm here in New York.â He called DâAntoni, who also coached him in Phoenix, âa phenomenal coach.â Chauncey Billups, who was acquired in the Carmelo Anthony trade in February, said: âI think that you got to be patient, man. I think that Mike has done a great job, for what he had this year.â
