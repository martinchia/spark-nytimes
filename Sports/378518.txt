Advertisement By ALEX YANNIS and  Golfers kept stopping by the table where Jim McGovern was sipping a beverage to comment that he shouldn't have made them look so bad today at the Century Country Club. McGovern drank it all in. All he had done was shoot two five-under-par 66's to finish four shots ahead of the field in the 36-hole sectional qualifying for the United States Open next week. McGovern and seven others from an entry of 67 nailed down the eight spots available for the tournament, which begins June 18 at Pebble Beach, Calif. His two impressive rounds over the 6,809-yard, par-71 course were accomplished on 13 birdies, a double bogey and a bogey. He credited a friend, Mike O'Gorman, for helping him with a minor adjustement in his swing and his putting. Advertisement McGovern, who is from Oradell, N.J., and Ken Green, a native of Danbury, Conn., who shot two 70's, were the only players from a group of regulars on the PGA Tour who managed to qualify here. Advertisement Wayne Levi, a 12-time winner on the PGA Tour, who is 38th on the money list this season, did not show up and failed to inform officials for the reason of his absence. Despite his number of victories, four of which came two years ago, Levi had to qualify for the Open this year because he was not in the top 30 on the money list last year and is currently 38th this season. The top 30 last year and the top 10 as of May 27 this year are automatically eligible for the Open.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

"He's been playing a lot and the wet weather last week didn't help him." Green, a native of Danbury, Conn, has five victories on the PGA Tour, including three top-10 finishes this season, in which he has earned $230,417. George Zahringer 3d, the seven-time player of the year in the metropolitan area, had the lowest score among the five amateurs at 143. But it wasn't enough to qualify him for his first United States Open.                    --------------------       Debut for Arizona St. Golfer (The Associated Press) -- Phil Mickelson will make his professional debut at the United States Open after qualifying for the event Tuesday. The reigning and three-time National Collegiate Athletic Association champion from Arizona State had a 132, including a course-record 63, at Farmington Country Club in Germantown, Tenn. Lance Ten Broeck led qualifying at Germantown with a 131. Dan Forsman also had a 132. Michael Walton, who had a course-record 65 on Monday before play was suspended, came back with a 70 and led four qualifiers at the Golf Club of Georgia in Alpharetta, Ga. David Duval, a junior at Georgia Tech, also got in with his second 70. Jay Delsing had a 135 to lead three qualifers at Forest Hills Country Club in Chesterfield, Mo.
