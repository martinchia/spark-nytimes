Alabamaâs dominating performance in the B.C.S. title game was more than just another championship game victory. It was a victory for the university and the city of Tuscaloosa. The Crimson Tide and Tuscaloosa faced considerable adversity before the team’s 2011 campaign began. They lost a brother in teammate Aaron Douglas, a sister in Carson Tinkerâs girlfriend Ashley Harrison, and many other family members after the April 27 tornado destroyed half of the city of Tuscaloosa and other parts of Alabama. In most cases, pressure busts pipes, but for the Tide it made diamonds in the form of a crystal trophy.  Alabama went on its run with a fiery head coach, a powerful running back, and a stifling defense. Senior defensive lineman Josh Chapman, who was a part of the 2009 championship team, said this one means a little more. âItâs not just for us, itâs for the entire state, the organization and the city of Tuscaloosa,â  Chapman said. âThis is something for the people in Tuscaloosa to feed off of and hang their hats on.â In Tuscaloosa, there is nothing better than when Alabama is on top of the college football world. Football is king in the South and with two championships in three years–this one coming off a highly emotional season–Tide fans can rejoice and enjoy the victory. âA lot of people were affected by the tornado and we just wanted to put the city on our back and let them know we cared,â running back Trent Richardson said.  Now, thoughts turn to next season. Alabama will lose major contributors from one of the best statistical defenses of all-time such as Courtney Upshaw, Dontâa Hightower and Mark Barron. On offense, wide receivers Marquis Maze and Darius Hanks, along with center William Vlachos, are all seniors who played their last game for Alabama. Other players like juniors Dre Kirkpatrick and Trent Richardson will have tough decisions to make about their futures when deciding whether to enter the draft or return to school.  Richardson, a father of two, said being a parent would influence his decision. âItâs going to be a big decision, but itâs still tough,â Richardson said. âIâm only a few hours away from getting my degree, but at the same time, I have mouths to feed. Iâm going to talk to Coach [Saban] and my mom and Iâm going to let yâall know sooner than later.â Richardson said he has yet to talk to the N.F.L. advisory board because âhe didnât want to be a distraction to the team or himself.â The Tide will retain talent on both sides of the ball. College football and basketball coaches always talk about how having experienced talent is better than just talent or experience without the other. Alabama will bring back players such as A J McCarron and Eddie Lacy on offense along with four of their five starting lineman, including All-American Barrett Jones.  Defensively, the Tide will be anchored by Robert Lester, Jesse Williams and C J  Mosley. Throughout the season, Alabama dominated opponents, which allowed younger players to get valuable game experience, but Alabama will also be very young at positions on both sides of the ball.  Saban said success can sometimes bring complacency and he wants his team to stay focused. âYou need to have tremendous leadership and maturity to be able to respond to that in the right way,â Saban said. âThat will be a challenge for our group [next season].â Every season brings new challenges for teams that have won championships, but if any group can handle the pressure it would be a Saban-coached team. Early predictions for next season have Alabama, L.S.U. and U.S.C. as the favorites to win the 2012 B.C.S. title.
