 The field of nearly 3,000 dogs at the 138th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show got whittled to one best in show at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday night, as Sky, a 5-year-old wire fox terrier, took the crown.  Also on Tuesday night, Matisse, a Portuguese water dog, won the working group, and Riley, an Irish water spaniel, won the sporting group. On Monday, Nathan, a 3-year-old Bloodhound, won the hound group. Classie, a 4-year-old Miniature Pinscher, placed first in the toy group. Ally, a white Standard Poodle, topped the non-sporting group. Coco Posh, a Cardigan Welsh Corgi, won the herding group.  Here’s a look back at some of the highlights and behind-the-scenes moments.

New breeds like rat terrier â and the other newbies at the show, the chinook and the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno â generally need time at an elite show like Westminster to demonstrate their bona fides. There are, after all, plenty of breeds that have never won. It took until 2008, more than 130 years into Westminsterâs history, for a beagle, Uno, to win.
And while terriers have won Westminsterâs top prize 45 times, Marti was unlikely to win the terrier group and advance to Best in Show against the winners of six other groups Tuesday night … Read more Â»

Some canines get ribeye and chicken in the ring. Sassy Girl, a St. Bernard from Rochester,  prefers something else. She likes the comedy stylings of “America’s Funniest Home Videos,” broadcast on an iPod (no sound) that her owner wears on her wrist. Susie Collier said Sassy Girl also liked to watch “Judge Judy” and Yankees games.
Sassy Girl, a 176-pound television junkie, also doubles as a therapy dog for others, and most important, for Collier. Collier suffered a stroke last year, and she credits Sassy Girl with her recovery. Collier was determined to show again, and Sassy Girl helped her by letting her lean on her, literally and figuratively. 
This is Collier and Sassy Girl’s first time at Westminster, and given her year, Collier couldn’t be more thrilled. “The most important thing is to have fun,” she said. 
She just has to make sure her iPod is charged.

You might not think that a 135-pound wrinkly faced dog would be good with kids, but Diesel, a bull mastiff, is a saint. Diesel’s owner, Bill D’Angelo, has a 9-month-old grandchild at home on Long Island who pulls on this laid-back giant, and when he’s had enough he simply walks away. 
It’s common here at Westminster to see large dogs, like Great Danes, Leonbergers and St. Bernards, on the floor with spectators, soaking up the attention.

Gilbert is a lone ranger this year. The 7-year-old from Orlando, Fla., with a taste for London broil, is the only Dandie Dinmont Terrier showing this year. 
Dandies, known for their short legs, long body and large head, are becoming increasingly difficult to find in the United States and are considered a vulnerable breed by the kennel club of the United Kingdom. According to Gilbert’s owner, Kay Simpson, 12 years ago, half the dandie population was sired by the same male. With that, comes health problems and a weakened gene pool. Simpson is hoping to obtain a female from overseas so Gilbert can sire his own litter. 
Known as big dogs in little bodies, these terriers don’t shed and make great family pets with their reputation for being couch potatoes.  
For now, Gilbert enjoys being an ambassador of the breed and certainly earns the title of “Gentleman of the Terriers.”
