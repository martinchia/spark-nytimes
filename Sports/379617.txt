It’s thought the N.B.A. All-Star weekend is a chance for weary players and coaches to refresh, recharge and come back for the second half of the season raring to play. Apparently, the long weekend did not do the trick for the Orlando Magic. Its All-Star center, Dwight Howard, who did not have the weekend off, is showing signs of fraying patience. The Magic lost, 111-105, to the Kings on Wednesday, and Howard seemed plenty annoyed with his teammates. He frequently yelled and snapped at his them during the game, begging them to play harder, according to The Orlando Sentinel. After the game he sounded like a parent who is tired of begging a child to clean his room:
 “Iâve said everything there is to say,” Howard said. “Thatâs it. Iâve talked every timeout, when weâre in the huddle, in the locker roomâ¦ What, you want me to Tweet about it? Iâve done everything Iâm supposed to do as a leader.” “…If guys donât want to play, theyâve got to sit down. We just canât have guys or anybody out there not playing hard.” This season has been a frustrating and annoying ride so far, as the Magic continues to fall short in becoming one of the East’s elite teams. The Magic stand fourth in the Eastern Conference, 6.5 games back of the leading Boston Celtics and Miami Heat. Howard continued his introspection. âWe have a lot of talent, but talent will not get you a championship,â Howard said. âWeâre one of the most talented teams in the NBA. Weâre a deep team. Weâve got guys who can do a lot of different things. But if we donât bring it every night, itâs a waste of talent.â It’s an old hoops adage that you can’t coach effort, and Howard is wondering aloud what’s going on with the Magic. âEverybody on the team has to step up and play hard,â he said. âIâm not singling anybody out. Iâm not calling anybody out. But as a team, if we donât play hard weâre going to lose every night.â
