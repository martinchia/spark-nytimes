CreditBarton Silverman/The New York Times         The Broadway Hat, Duffy’s Shovel, the Starter Jacket, the Haida Hat. They are the talismans of victory for N.H.L. players, odd objects of pride and fun. Most of all they are the emblems of teamwork and camaraderie, curios that help cement the bonds of a hockey club. The idea is simple: After each victory, the player judged most deserving gets the coveted object. The next time the team wins, that player must give it up — but he decides who the next recipient will be, and in the couple of minutes before reporters enter the dressing room, when the players have the room all to themselves, he passes it to the new honoree. And so on, after every win. Even if a team’s playoff hopes slip away in these waning days of the regular season, the players still pass around these objects. And for those that advance deep into the playoffs, their tradition often becomes famous. The Pittsburgh Penguins used to pass around a shovel after every win. It belonged to a longtime arena worker, and when he died, the players made the shovel their coveted prize: The Kevin “Duffy” Shovel Award. This season the Penguins pass around a rock they carried in a hill-climbing contest held during a preseason team-building exercise at West Point.

The player who gets it must wear it during postgame interviews. Advertisement The same is true for the Dallas Stars, who pass around a cowboy hat. The Winnipeg Jets award an R.C.A.F. aviator’s helmet, complete with a full, tinted visor; the Florida Panthers, a Macho Man Randy Savage hat; the Columbus Blue Jackets, a toy crown; the Phoenix Coyotes, a boxing-style championship belt — as the Chicago Blackhawks used in 2010, during their run to their first Stanley Cup in 49 years.

Many teams pass around a hard hat, a longstanding tradition symbolizing hard work. In 2011, when the Boston Bruins made their run to the Stanley Cup title, they passed around a 1980s Bruins Starter jacket, which defenseman Andrew Ference found on eBay. It became a charged talisman when Nathan Horton was sidelined by a concussion during a victory over Vancouver in Game 3 of the finals, and the Bruins hung the jacket in his empty dressing-room stall. Boston went on to win Game 4, and Horton made certain to be present to hand off the jacket — an act the Bruins and their fans found inspirational. Teams tend to change their talisman after each season, but not the Rangers, who have passed a fedora, the Broadway Hat, from player to player for the last three seasons. The hat becomes quite battered by the end of the season, so each year it is replaced, once with the owner James Dolan’s fedora. The tradition dates to a preseason game the Rangers played in Gothenburg, Sweden, in September 2011. After the game, the Rangers went to a local club, where they met a woman named Helena Erikson, who was wearing her favorite hat. “Brad Richards liked it, too,” Erikson said in an email. “I said, ‘O.K., you can have it, but it’s 149 kroner’ — like, $15 — and he paid me $100, so I earned some Swedish kroner there.” (Richards confirmed her story, saying, “She kind of drove the price up on us.”) Erikson’s hat became the Broadway Hat, and the Rangers hope they’ll be passing it around, like the Bruins did with their Starter jacket and the Blackhawks with their championship belt, deep into June.
