Advertisement  John Martin of South Africa, leader in the BOC solo race round the world, slammed into an iceberg Sunday in the South Pacific Ocean. Race officials in Newport, R.I., said that Martin sent a message by radio indicating that he was heading for southern Chile, a distance of nearly 2,000 miles northeast, for repairs. It appeared that the iceberg cracked the hull of Martin's 60-foot sailboat, Allied Bank, damaging the keel. An unusually warm summer in the southern ocean has created more icebergs than usual, said a race official. Thirteen of the 20 boats competing in the BOC race are sailing in the iceberg area. The fleet left Sydney on Feb. 3 for the third stage of the 27,000-mile competition. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
