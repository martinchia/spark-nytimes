Advertisement  TRACK AND FIELD Two Records Set Noureddine Morceli, the Algerian miler, broke the world indoor record for 1,000 meters yesterday at an international meet in Birmingham, England, and Liz McColgan of Scotland shattered the world mark for the women's 5,000 meters. Morceli took the lead with two laps of the five-lap race to go and finished in 2 minutes 15.26 seconds. He broke the record set four years ago by Rob Druppers of the Netherlands at 2:16.4 seconds. McColgan, with a time of 15:03.17, shaved more than 10 seconds off German Uta Pippig's record. McColgan, winner of the 1991 New York City Marathon, had never run five kilometers indoors. Leroy Burrell edged Frankie Fredericks in the 60 meters in his fastest time of the indoor season, 6.51 seconds. American Michelle Finn won the women's 60 meters in 7.17.(AP) Bubka Does 20-1 1/2: Sergei Bubka raised his world pole vault record to 20 feet 1 1/2 inches in a special indoor meet in Berlin just for jumpers. The 28-year-old Ukrainian, the gold medal winner at the Seoul Olympics, went over the bar on his second attempt at 20-1 1/2, one-half an inch higher than the record he set last year. (AP) TENNIS Edberg Gains Final Stefan Edberg battled into the final of the $1 million Eurocard Classic for the second straight year by beating Petr Korda of Czechoslovakia yesterday, and will play Goran Ivanisevic for the title today in Stuttgart, Germany. The second-seeded Edberg, still struggling to find his best form, came back from a service break behind in the second set to win, 6-4, 6-4, in their semifinal. Ivanisevic, seeded seventh, defeated unseeded Aleksandr Volkov of Russia, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. Edberg edged in front when Korda served three double-faults in the 10th game, allowing Edberg to break serve and take the first set, 6-4. Korda broke Edberg's serve early in the second set, but with the Czechoslovak leading, 4-2, Edberg won four straight games to take the match. Edberg has not won a tournament since the Seiko Indoor last October. Ivanisevic, fresh from an upset of top-ranked Jim Courier on Friday night, again used his blistering serve to good advantage in a tight battle with Volkov. (AP) McNeil Advances: Third-seeded Lori McNeil gained her fourth appearance in the final of the Virginia Slims of Oklahoma yesterday by defeating Manon Bollegraf of the Netherlands, 6-3, 7-5. McNeil, who won the Oklahoma City tournament in 1988 and was second in 1986 and 1987, ran her record to 18-3 in the four appearances. McNeil will face the winner of last night's late match between top-seeded Zina Garrison and 1990 Virginia Slims of Oklahoma champion Amy Frazier for the title in the $150,000 tournament. (AP) GOLF Berteotti a Leader Missie Berteotti will take sloppy over good every time it puts her in the lead of a tournament with one round to play. Berteotti charged to a six-under 138 and a share of the lead with Michelle McGann on Friday after two rounds of the Hawaiian Ladies Open at Ko Olina Golf Course. Berteotti and McGann have much in common. Both shot five-under 67's Friday and both have never won on the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour. Starting on the back nine, McGann parred the first three holes before sinking a five-foot birdie putt on No. 13 on Friday. She followed with a birdie on the par-5 14th after chipping to two feet of the cup, then went four-under on No. 15 with a 15-foot birdie. She made a 12-footer for birdie on No. 17 to make the turn at five-under. On the par-5 first hole she chipped from a sand bunker to four inches of the cup, then made birdie. She stayed at six-under the rest of the round, making a nice save for par on the par-4 No. 6 with a tough 10-foot putt that was set up by a nice chip shot from 35 yards away. (AP) Buick Shortened to 54 Holes: An unprecedented shotgun start was avoided yesterday when heavy fog forced cancellation of the third round of the Buick Invitational of California in San Diego. Play was called for the day at 2 P.M., Pacific time, and the tournament was shortened to 54 holes, with the final round scheduled for today on the South course at Torrey Pines.  Tom Watson, 41, shares the lead at 131, 13-under par, with Brad Faxon and Mike Springer. Robert Wrenn and rookie Chris Tucker were one stroke back at 132, and Steve Pate and Steve Elkington of Australia followed at 133. The course, stretching along cliffs overlooking the Pacific, was shrouded by heavy fog long before the round's scheduled starting time and none of 74 players got away. Officials, anticipating a lifting of the fog, had made contingency plans for a shotgun start, using all 18 tees as starting points. The simultaneous start frequently is used in unofficial competition at club tournaments, corporate outings and pro-am events. The fun-time format, however, has not been used in professional tournament competition.(AP) HORSE RACING It's Boom Towner Boom Towner held off fast-closing Club De Noche by a nose yesterday to win his sixth straight race Saturday -- Aqueduct's $84,450 Sporting Plate Handicap. Diane Nelson rode Boom Towner hard, covering the six furlongs on the fast track in 1:10:2 to earn $50,670 for Anthony DeMarco. Favored Shuttleman finished a neck behind Club De Noche for third in the race for horses 3 years old and up. Boom Towner returned $7.60, $4.20 and $2.10 for $2 across the board. Club De Noche paid $8.40 and $2.10, and Shuttleman paid $2.10. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
