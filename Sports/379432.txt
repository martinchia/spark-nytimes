The Giants signed running back Ahmad Bradshaw on Monday afternoon, solving one of their major problems on offense. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The 25-year old Bradshaw led the Giants with 1,235 rushing yards last season and also caught 47 passes. With Bradshaw and Brandon Jacobs both signed to new contracts (Jacobs restructured his deal last week), the Giants will now return both of their leading rushers from last season. Bradshaw was an unrestricted free agent who reportedly drew some interest on the open market. Over the last few days, however, potential suitors for Bradshaw found running back options elsewhere. The Redskins traded for Cardinals running back Tim Hightower, while the Bengals re-signed running back Cedric Benson.  The Giants were meeting with former Falcons running back Jason Snelling when the Bradshaw signing was announced. With Bradshaw in the fold, the Giants are unlikely to pursue Snelling.
