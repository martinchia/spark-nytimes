 SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Notre Dame said on Tuesday that forward Natalie Achonwa's knee, which she injured Monday night in an 88-69 victory over Baylor, will keep her from playing in the Final Four next week in Nashville. The university said that Achonwa, a 6-foot-3 forward, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee. She caught a pass in the paint from Kayla McBride with just under five minutes remaining and was bumped from behind by Chardonae Fuqua. She yelled as she fell to the ground and grabbed her left knee. Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw said in a statement that while Achonwa would not play in the Final Four “her voice will be heard loud and clear in the locker room, on the bench and in the huddle.” We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
