Most people have already engraved Serena Williamsâ name on the U.S. Open womenâs singles trophy for 2011 following her dominating semi-final victory over world No. 1, Caroline Wozniacki, Saturday night. Not so fast. The final is still to be played this afternoon, and the opponent on the other side of the net could provide the perfect storm for Serena. Samantha Stosur, seeded ninth from Australia, has exactly the right mix of offensive weapons and defensive speed that can derail Serenaâs Grand Slam aspirations. After all, it has happened before.  Stosur defeated Williams 6-2, 6-7(2), 8-6 in the 2010 French Open quarterfinals, saving a match point along the way. That victory helped propel Stosur to the finals, where she lost to Francesca Schiavone.  The win over Williams and the experience of already competing in a Grand Slam final will give Stosur the necessary confidence to know that tonight could be hers as well. I have known Stosur since she was a junior in Australia, transitioning into the professional ranks. Her game is built around a heavy serve and a power forehand – exactly the right weapons to derail Williams.  The deciding third set of their French Open match, which Stosur won 8-6, provides an ideal snapshot of the tactics for tonightâs final. In the third set, Stosur dominated once the point developed into a rally, hitting five of the six groundstroke winners (two backhand/three forehand).  Williams wanted to keep the point as short as possible, hitting six of the eight aces, and two backhand return winners in the third set. Williamsâ game is built around hitting through opponents, bullying them with pure power that is difficult to control. Hitting through her opponents results in a lot of short balls, where she often finishes at the net with swinging volleys.  But it is a lot harder for Williams to play through Stosur, because she is better able to handle the power, and then get Williams on the run where she is not nearly as comfortable.  Stosur was able to dominate the baseline rallies in Paris because of her willingness to run around her backhand in the Ad court and get control with her forehand. The run-around forehand has three advantages that gave Stosur the necessary edge once the point got developed from the back of the court. The first was that it turned what would have been a neutral backhand rally ball for Stosur into an offensive forehand. An upgrade in spin, power, depth and direction. Secondly, that forehand could now be taken down the line with authority, effectively doubling the target area that Stosur can hit in to. Lastly, the run-around forehand in the Ad court is naturally well disguised, so Williams has to wait until the ball comes off the strings before chasing after it. Robbing Williams of anticipation gave Stosur the split-second advantage she needed to effectively run Williams to either side of the court and control the baseline.  Stosur also has the best kick serve in the womenâs game, and the ability to make it bounce high out of Williamâs strike zone provides a serving edge other women donât have against Williams. This afternoon will be a battle of two different game styles, and the winner will be the player who can better impose her patterns of play on the opponent.  Williams will be looking to play âfirst strikeâ tennis, to shorten the point with raw power off the serve and return. Stosur will be countering by trying to neutralize that power with depth to get into the point, and then turn the rally into an athletic event resulting in numerous Ad court forehands.  Probably best to wait until this match is completed before calling for the engraver.
