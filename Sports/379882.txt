Advertisement  In his first news conference in Cincinnati since pleading guilty one year ago to felony charges of cheating on his taxes, PETE ROSE said goodbye yesterday to the city in which he grew up, played and managed, and added that the defending World Series champion Reds were overrated. Rose, who led the Reds to four consecutive second-place finishes from 1985-88, said his former team was lucky to still be in contention the way it has played in losing 11 of the last 12 games. "I just don't think the Reds are as good as we all thought they'd be," Rose told a news conference, shortly before leaving for his new residence in Boca Raton, Fla. Rose said he had completed the community service that was the final part of his sentence and that it was better for his two young children, TYLER, 6, and CARA, 1, to be away from the city where his name once was synonymous with baseball. He said they won't have to endure cruel taunts from other children. "I'll never leave Cincinnati, per se," he said. "I just feel at this time that I can live with my family a more normal life in the Florida area." (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
