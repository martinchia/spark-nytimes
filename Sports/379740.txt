It was not supposed to be this way. The United States women’s soccer team, recognized the world over as a powerhouse (at least for the past 20 years or so), must win a home-and-home, total-goals series against Italy to qualify for next summer’s Women’s World Cup in Germany. (If the teams are tied on total goals after two games, away goals will count double. If the teams are tied on goals and have both scored the same amount of away goals, or neither team has scored over the 180 minutes, two 15-minute overtime periods will be played. If that still doesnât determine a winner, then penalty kicks will decide the series.) The opening game in the series will be played Saturday at Euganeo Stadium in Padova (ESPN3.com, 10:30 a.m., Eastern).  âWhen you talk to people, be it journalists, coaches and people around the world, this is an important game,” Coach Pia Sundhage said on Thursday during a telephone conference call. “The fact that weâre playing in this game, everyone is very interested in how it will go. The journalists here are asking a lot of questions about the team and itâs exciting.â Sundhage has taken 24 players to Italy, the 20 who were on the roster in Mexico, plus Leslie Osborne, Lindsay Tarpley, Tina DiMartino and Ashlyn Harris. Each team can dress 18 players for the matches. The American team finds itself in this predicament because of a 2-1 loss to host Mexico in the semifinals of the Concacaf qualifying tournament. Mexico and Canada earned the region’s two automatic berths; the United States advanced to the playoff series against Italy by defeating Costa Rica in the third-place game. Before that, the United States had a 19-0 record in Concacaf qualifying matches for the Womenâs World Cup. A loss to Italy would make this the first American team not to qualify for the Womenâs World Cup since the tournamentâs inception in 1991. The United States last won the championship as host in 1999. The precarious situation the American women find themselves in has brought them attention, but perhaps not the right kind of attention. “The irony of the whole thing is that when the U.S. men win they get the coverage, but when the U.S. women lose we get the coverage,” striker Abby Wambach said. “The problem with that is that we are good enough and we do deserve to be in the World Cup in Germany but we need to prove it. The joke among us is that we planned it this way and that we knew this was the only way to get the coverage that we think we deserve. Thatâs obviously a joke. Moving forward we feel like so many people have put so many hours into this team. Weâre going to do out part, win this game on Saturday, go home to Chicago and win that game.â The final draw for the Women’s World Cup will be held on Nov. 29 in Germany.
