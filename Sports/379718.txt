 Several star players were on the move Tuesday, 24 hours before the N.H.L. trade deadline, including goalie Roberto Luongo, who was ushered out of Vancouver and sent back to Florida eight years after he was sent packing from there. The Panthers, on their way to missing the playoffs, dealt goalie Jacob Markstrom and forward Shawn Matthias to the Canucks for Luongo and forward Steven Anthony. Luongo was the highest-profile goalie on the move, but he was hardly alone. The Anaheim Ducks sent goalie Viktor Fasth to the Edmonton Oilers for a 2014 fifth-round pick and a 2015 third-round selection. Edmonton then traded the veteran goalie Ilya Bryzgalov to the Minnesota Wild for a fourth-round draft pick this year. The Western Conference-leading Ducks traded forward Dustin Penner to the Washington Capitals for a fourth-round pick this year, then moved the pick to the Dallas Stars for defenseman Stephane Robidas. The Islanders started their sell-off by dealing defenseman Andrew MacDonald to the Philadelphia Flyers for two draft picks and the minor league center Matt Mangene.
