Advertisement  AP The Boston Garden is no garden spot for the Utah Jazz. On Friday night, the Jazz lost their 21st straight game there, falling to the Celtics, 112-101. Utah has never won a game at the Garden. "I haven't won in this building, but the Celtics have had some good teams," said Utah guard John Stockton. "We'll keep trying, but sometimes it's like knocking your head against the wall." Boston, which leads the Atlantic Division, has won 12 of its last 14 games. Utah, the Midwest leader, lost for only the second time in 10 games. "They've had a couple of chances of beating us since I've been here," said Larry Bird, who had 10 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter. "The same thing happened in those games. We beat them at the end." Advertisement The Celtics got a lift from reserve Ed Pinckney, who had 7 points and 11 rebounds in 26 minutes. "Ed Pinckney was the difference in the second half," Boston's Robert Parish said. "He had big rebounds and a big block. He also scored baskets and got our transition going." Advertisement Jeff Malone's layup cut Boston's lead to five late in the game, but the Celtics scored the next five points on a foul shot by Bird, a jumper by Reggie Lewis and two free throws by Kevin McHale. "They go to their strengths down the stretch," said Utah's Karl Malone, who scored 39 points. "It's a tough loss. We were there the whole game." Pistons 112, Lakers 93 AUBURN HILLS, Mich.
