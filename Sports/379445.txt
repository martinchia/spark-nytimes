They had been standing in line to get into the 10,103-seat Louis Armstrong Stadium for over an hour and there were 400 people ahead of them. At the rate the line was moving, it would take Rohan Menon, Rahul Sabhnani and Mira Bhatia, George Washington University students, longer to get in to see Novak Djokovicâs fourth-round match against Alexandr Dolgopolov than the 2 hours, 7 minutes it took Djokovic, the top seed, to polish off his third-round opponent.  No matter how long it took, âWeâre going to stay,â Menon said.  Menon and his friends were the lucky ones. By half-past-noon, the line to get into Entrance D at Armstrong snaked across the grounds, all the way to Court 7, and numbered easily over 1,200. The scheduling, made to accommodate CBSâ Labor Day coverage, had the Americans Serena Williams and Mardy Fish playing prime-time afternoon matches on Ashe.  The slight on Djokovic was a delight to fans who couldnât procure Ashe tickets but suddenly had the chance to behold Djokovic, who has lost only two matches all year. Those stuck in the middle of the line had the advantage of being able to watch the first match on Armstrong, between Janko Tipsarevic and Juan Carlos Ferrero, on the jumbo screen in the main courtyard.  The voice of the public announcer wafted out from Armstrong. âPlease be advised that Louis Armstrong is filled to capacity,â he began. Before he had finished, the line to get into the show court had grown by three people.     Eric Kwok and two of his friends were undeterred by the sea of heads in front of them. âHopefully people are going to leave to go to lunch,â he said. He was rooting for a five-set match from Tipsarevic and Ferrero in the belief that the longer the match, the more people would eventually bail from their seats.   âWeâre trying to be optimistic,â Kwok said, adding, âItâs not that hot today. Weâve got the wind. Itâs fun to wait and see.â   Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
