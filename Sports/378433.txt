Advertisement  Corporate support of yachting events brings with it a tenuous existence, as organizers of New York's Liberty Cup Match Racing Regatta acknowledged recently. The group, the Harbor Festival Foundation, canceled this year's event at the last minute. Bill Darnell, executive director of the foundation, said last week that that his staff was unable to find adequate sponsorship. The four-day regatta was scheduled to begin next Wednesday in New York Harbor. Darnell said that it cost about $300,000 to $400,000 to stage a Liberty Cup regatta. "Rather than go into deficit spending, we decided to postpone Liberty Cup until next year," Darnell said. "We had a sponsor who was committed up to the last minute, but then did not sign." The harbor foundation is a nonprofit organization supported by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
