Advertisement  AP Ricky Ervins rushed for a career-high 199 yards and 2 touchdowns, and No. 18 Southern Cal used an overpowering ground game to beat No. 15 Ohio State, 35-26, today in a game called by officials with 2 minutes 36 seconds remaining. Heavy rains and lightning in the second half thinned a crowd of 89,422 at Ohio Stadium. Officials met with both coaches twice in the fourth quarter, but did not stop play. After Ohio State (2-1) had scored, and Southern Cal had recovered the ensuing onsides kick, officials called the game. It was the first time in 101 years of Ohio State football that a game had been called before completion. Advertisement Southern Cal (3-1), which had totaled 248 yards rushing in its first three games, ran for 331 yards on 48 carries against an Ohio State defense that came in ranked third in the nation against the rush. Advertisement In a 31-0 loss at Washington last week, the Trojans had rushed 25 times for 28 yards, but they gained that much on their second attempt of the game. Ervins, who did not play in the fourth quarter, had been held to five yards on nine attempts against the Huskies, but picked up 164 yards and both of his touchdowns in the first half. Marinovich hit 11 of 23 passes for 119 yards with two interceptions as USC totaled 450 yards on offense. Frey completed 19 of 36 passes for 262 yards with an interception and freshman tailback Robert Smith had 54 yards on 12 carries to lead Ohio State, which had 341 yards on offense.

(AP) - Leodis Flowers ran for 151 yards, setting up one touchdown and scoring another in the second half, for eighth-ranked Nebraska. The Cornhuskers (4-0) entered the game as 51 1/2-point favorites over Oregon State (0-5) but struggled with penalties and fumbles as much as with the Beavers. Nebraska found itself trailing 7-3 at halftime after the Beavers' Kenyon Branscomb recovered a punt fumbled by Nebraska's Steve Carmer at the Husker 18 in the first quarter. Oregon State quarterback Matt Booher hit Dwayne Owens in the end zone three plays later for a 7-0 lead. Nebraska's offense struggled for 123 rushing yards in the first half and picked up only 8 in the air on one completion in eight attempts. Gregg Barrios provided the Huskers' only points with a 22-yard field goal in the first period. He missed a 49-yarder into an 8 mph wind as time ran out in the half. Northwestern 24, No. Illinois 7 EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) - Bob Christian rushed for 179 yards and one touchdown, and Len Williams passed for another touchdown as Northwestern ended a 14-game losing streak. Christian carried for a career-high 43 times to go over 2,000 yards as Northwestern (1-2) dominated the Huskies (2-3) with a defense, led by Ed Sutter, that disrupted Northern's wishbone led by Stacey Robinson. The victory was the first for Northwestern since a 28-7 victory over Purdue in the 10th game of the 1988 season. Williams's 7-yard touchdown pass to Chip Morris in the third quarter and a 26-yard field goal by Ira Adler with 3:08 left clinched the outcome. Back in 1982, Northwestern ended a then college-record 34-game losing streak with a 31-6 victory over Northern Illinois. Advertisement Oklahoma 31, Kansas 17 NORMAN, Okla.
