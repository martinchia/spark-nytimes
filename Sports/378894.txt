His Norwegian language skills may be rudimentary, but Josh Gatt has begun to develop a fluency in the life of a professional soccer player in Europe. âItâs really not a big problem; it seems everyone speaks English,â he said. âThe only times they break into Norwegian is when they want to hide something from me.â Less than 18 months after graduating from high school in Michigan, Gatt, 20, lifted the championship trophy in November as Molde FK won its first Tippeligaen title in the history of the club, which was founded in June 1911. âIt was incredible; the whole place was exploding, 25,000 people partying and the whole place was electric,â Gatt said in a telephone interview from his parentsâ home in Plymouth, Mich., early last month. âIâll remember it forever. It was a fantastic feeling.â Gatt, a swift and skilled 5-foot-9 right-sided midfielder, landed in Molde, a coastal city of 25,000 in southern Norway, after a brief stint with SCR Altach of the Austrian second division. Before moving to Europe, Gatt turned down a scholarship offer from Indiana University, a traditional N.C.A.A. Division I power. During a trip to Europe for a tournament with his club team, the Michigan Wolves, Gatt turned some heads and drew attention from Austria and the German club FSV Mainz 05.  âI wanted to play professionally in Europe since I was 12; itâs been my dream,â he said. âMy parents asked me what I would do if it didnât happen, but I never really had a backup plan. I wanted to follow my dream and I donât regret it.â Gatt is among a group of promising American players in Europe and in Major League Soccer who are part of the pool for the under-23 menâs national team that will attempt to qualify for next summerâs London Olympics during a tournament from March 22 to April 2. Although Gatt was not called into the under-23 training camp in Florida â the team is being coached by Caleb Porter, the coach at the University of Akron â his age and first-team experience is certain to keep him on the Olympic and national team radar as the new year progresses. Gatt went to Altach, in the extreme west of Austria, in the summer of 2010 and experienced a painful surprise. âAt first, I was shocked and in awe,â Gatt said. âI had been running track my senior year and thought I was in great shape. But I was so far behind the guys I was playing with. Physically. Mentally. Everything. The conditioning work was the hardest Iâve ever done in my life. You get beat up really bad. It took me by storm how intense it was. At first, I wasnât doing well and I needed to catch up. I got my rhythm after the first month or so and was doing well, which got me to Norway.â After a game toward the end of the first half of the season in Austria, Gatt was approached by Moldeâs coach, one of the clubâs former players who had gone on to a decent career at Manchester United. âBeing an American who really didnât grow up following soccer, I didnât know who he was,â Gatt said. âI did some research and was in shock, to say the least. When I found out who would be my coach, of course I knew I would go there.â The coach is Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, 38, a former Norway international (67 caps) who is remembered in northwest England for scoring the game-winning goal for United against Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final. After leading Molde to a title in his first season as the coach, Solskjaer has been mentioned as a possible successor to Alex Ferguson, Unitedâs longtime manager. (Solskjaer coached Unitedâs reserve team in 2010.) âHe is fantastic,â Gatt said. âOne of the nicest coaches Iâve had in a long time, but he can be tough and get in your face, and you need that in a coach. He has a lot of young talent and used it very well.â Gatt added: âI got there in January and the preseason was tough: most of the work on the ball and not a lot of straight running. I loved it. It took a while to adjust to the level of play, but once I hit my stride, I had some good games.â Gatt scored a spectacular goal against IK Start last April, taking a pass at midfield and making a run to the goal between two defenders before freeing himself with a quick move and blasting home a right-footed shot . âItâs been a real education for me,â Gatt said. âIâve matured as a man, emotionally and outside the field. I now see this as my profession, my job that I take seriously. Goal, The New York Times soccer blog, will report on news and features from the world of soccer and around the Web.
