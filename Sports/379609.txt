For the second straight year, Villanova is enduring a late-season skid, and this one appears to be even more crippling. âThis is a worse slump,â Coach Jay Wright said after his Wildcats lost their fifth consecutive game Tuesday night in the first round of the Big East tournament against 15th-seeded South Florida.Â   The Bulls overcame a 16-point halftime deficit, aided at least in part by an injury to Villanovaâs starting center, Mouphtaou Yarou â this coming just as the Wildcats had gotten back to full strength with the return of guard Corey Stokes from injury. âInjuries have occurred while weâre playing great teams and then as we get guys back, we never have been able to get into a rhythm,â Wright said.  âWe just donât have any rhythm or confidence.â As the team awaits an invitation to the N.C.A.A. tournament, it needs to figure out a way to turn around a season that went from 16-1 to 21-11 in less than two months.  Somehow, Wright retains a positive attitude by remembering tougher times. âThe early years at Hofstra were tougher,â he said, referring to his first head coaching job.  âWhen youâre in your third or fourth year and you havenât won anything yet and you might not have a job at the end of the year, that was a little bit tougher.â

His years at Villanova havenâtÂ  been smooth sailing either. âWe had the phone scandal; we had guys suspended;  weâve had some times,â he said, before returning to the present struggle.  âItâs really tough on our guys.  Itâs very tough on our fans, and Iâm trying to be the one to hold it together.  Itâs disappointing, Iâll tell you that.  Itâs very disappointing.â Stokes is trying to maintain a brave face as well, as he did before the season when attempting to explain last yearâs swoon. âMight not seem like it, but we are getting better,â he said.  âWeâre going to work in practice and get ready for the tournament and just keep a positive attitude.â After being picked second and finishing 10th in the Big East, that may be the only thing the team has left.
