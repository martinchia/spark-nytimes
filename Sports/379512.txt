Advertisement  GOLF Rain Scrambles Leader Board Rain left the first day of the L.P.G.A.'s $400,000 Lady Keystone Open in Hershey, Pa., inconclusive, with Nanci Bowen finishing the round yesterday with a five-under-par 67 and Laurel Kean at six under through 15 holes. The opening round of the 54-hole tournament was halted twice by thunderstorms for a total delay of almost four hours. The players who failed to finish their first rounds will start early today before the second round begins. Kean, who hasn't won in five years on the tour, had two eagles for a 30 on the back side of the 6,348-yard West Course of the Hershey Country Club. Bowen, who has missed the cut in 11 of her 12 L.P.G.A. appearances, had played just three holes when thunderstorms hit the course and forced a delay of nearly three hours.
