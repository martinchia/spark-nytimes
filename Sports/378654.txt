Chase Stuart of Pro-Football-Reference.com is weighing in on the 2011 Jets.  The 2011 Jets offense is weighing on him. (He’s a Jets fan). A few excerpts from his blog post: Simply put, the offensive line and the wide receiver group look worse entering 2011 than they did entering 2010, while the running game comes with more question marks. Stuart wrote that an improvement by Mark Sanchez “into an above-average quarterback” was the only hope for the offense: At running back, it’s Shonn Greene’s show. But it’s hard to imagine the combination of Greene and Tomlinson will be noticeably better than they were last season, or come close to matching the monster numbers produced by the running attack in 2009. The Jets saw a dropoff at LG when they replaced Faneca with Slauson and could see a worse regression with Hunter replacing Woody. Replacing Edwards, Cotchery and Brad Smith with Burress, Mason and rookie Jeremy Kerley is the big wild card. I view that as a noticeable downgrade. 
Stuart is much more optimistic about the defense, but then, the defense will have no choice but to carry the team, he said. The only way the Jets reach the Super Bowl this season is if the defense reverts to its dominant ’09 form. In an interview with Gang Green Nation, Sean McCormick, who wrote the Jets preview chapter for Football Outsiders, was also underwhelmed by the acquisition of Plaxico Burress: There is an established narrative that Burressâ arrest sent the Giantsâ passing game into a tailspin, but their passing DVOA was actually better in the games where Burress was out. The Jets would have been better off in the short term and in the long term by simply re-signing Braylon Edwards. Extra point What is your expectation for the Jets this season?  And specifically, have they improved at wide receiver or regressed? The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
