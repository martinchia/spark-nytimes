Mariano Rivera will pitch one last time in Yankee Stadium on Thursday, and it could be the last relief appearance of his 19-year career. With the Yankees eliminated from the postseason, Rivera could accomplish one more thing in the final three games of the season against the Houston Astros: playing center field. Rivera enjoys chasing fly balls in center field during batting practice (in fact, he sustained a season-ending injury doing that in Kansas City last year). Manager Joe Girardi is considering having Rivera play center field against the Houston Astros as the three games between the two teams, starting Friday, will be virtually meaningless. Earlier in the season, Rivera asked Girardi for the opportunity to play in the field if it ever became a possibility.
 Now the baseball world may see if Rivera’s 43-year-old knees are sturdy enough to let him track down fly balls at game speed. During an interview at the New York Athletic Club on Thursday, Rivera acknowledged making a request to play center field several years ago but pointed out that “my knees now are not in the best shape to be there.” He added, âI respect the game so much, I won’t make a joke of it.â Still, Girardi has said he would consider letting Rivera play the outfield for an inning or so. âIt would be something I would have to talk to him about,â Girardi said. âIn my mind, thinking that heâs going to want to pitch, it would be a situation where I might bring him in the eighth to play the outfield and close him out in the ninth if we have that opportunity.â Rays Manager Joe Maddon, whose team won the first two games of a three-game series to help knock the Yankees out of the playoff picture, said he did not see any harm in having Rivera play center field for a couple of innings. Maddon said Rivera has always been a good athlete. âWe all know of his love of shagging in center field,â Maddon said. âI donât know how good of a hitter he would have been, but heâs definitely athletic enough to play other positions on the field.â There is one wrinkle: the center field in Houstonâs Minute Maid Park, the Astrosâ stadium, is different from any other in the major leagues. Talâs Hill in center field has a 30-degree incline that is 90 feet wide. âYeah, Iâm going to try to warn him about it,â Girardi said. âHopefully, we donât give any balls up on that hill. If so, just go get and see if he can throw him out.â The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
