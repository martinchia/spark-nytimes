Less than a day after the United States women’s national team won the regional qualifying tournament for this summerâs London Olympics, the top professional soccer league for women in the United States, the five-team Womenâs Professional Soccer, announced that it has suspended operations for the 2012 season and hoped to return to the field with eight teams in 2013. “We firmly believe there is a place in the global sports landscape for Women’s Professional Soccer,” the league’s chief executive, Jennifer O’Sullivan, said in a statement before taking part in a conference call later Monday with reporters.  “Making the decision to suspend the 2012 season was a difficult and painful one, but it is necessary to take the time to address current issues and solidify our business in order to provide appropriate support needed to achieve the League’s long-term goals. Those that take part in our League — players, partners and fans — deserve the best, and that is what we are taking the time to ensure we deliver when we resume play in 2013 and beyond.” Even with the afterglow from last yearâs Womenâs World Cup, in which the United States lost to Japan in the final, and the Olympics in the summer (for which the United States qualified last Friday), W.P.S. found itself in a dispute with one of its team owners and needed a waiver from U.S. Soccer (the sportâs national governing body) to play its fourth season in 2012 with only five teams.  Dan Borislow, who bought the Washington franchise last year, moved it to South Florida and renamed it magicJack, was hastily dropped by the league. Borislow, who invented a device for making inexpensive phone calls, has tied up the league in court, winning a recent decision in which the judge said W.P.S. had not followed its own bylaws in dropping the magicJack franchise. âLooking back, we didnât do enough due diligence and we knew it,â Thomas Hofstetter, the owner of the Sky Blue team that plays in New Jersey, said by telephone Monday. âAt that point last year, we didnât have a choice, we were not in a position to be very picky. âAs bad as it seems to be, I actually feel good about making the decision. If we played this season I felt the league would be done. I believe there would not be a 2013 season. If we want to be around long term we have to fix some of the issues.” In addition to Sky Blue, the league’s roster of teams included the Atlanta Beat, Boston Breakers, Philadelphia Independence and Western New York Flash.  While W.P.S. and Borislow are scheduled to return to court Wednesday, league officials determined it would be impossible to proceed with a season while tied up in court. W.P.S. also  lost one of its national sponsors, Puma, which supplied all teams with uniforms and decided not to renew its deal. Jennifer OâSullivan, the W.P.S. commissioner, said during a conference call that the league was close to a deal with a new equipment sponsor and several other national sponsors. Now, OâSullivan said, those deals are no longer moving forward, players who were under contract (including many United States national team players) are free to make their own deals, and the league would not return to the field even if the courts decide that magicJack should be reinstated.
 âThe bulk of my time has been spent dealing with negative issue,â OâSullivan said on the conference call. âUntil the legal situation is resolved, we canât put the focus back on the players and the game.â Asked if she could conceive of any scenario that would include magicJack in the league’s future she said: “I do not see the possibility of magicJack being included based on the current feeling of ownership.I don’t see that as possible for W.P.S.” According to some reports last week, W.P.S. and Borislow had agreed to allow magicJack to operate as a kind of barnstorming club, unaffiliated with the league, but playing against W.P.S. teams while keeping national team players on its payroll. Those players were said to include striker Abby Wambach  and goalkeeper Hope Solo. (During Olympic qualifying in Vancouver, British Columbia, Wambach called Borislow an âinspiration,â and said that she would not sign with a W.P.S. team for 2012.) Fitz Johnson, the chairman of the league’s board of directors and the owner of the Atlanta club, said during the conference call that Borislow and magicJack had not been in compliance with league bylaws.  “It’s a culmination of issues, a number of things,” Johnson said. “We’re talking about an owner who does not have regard for league authority and partners, speaks disparagingly about sponsors and owners, is detrimental to to the business. It’s difficult to move past when damage is done, in this case it was. Really tried to come to a resolution several times and found ourselves unable to.” He added, “MagicJack was just not complying with some basic rules and it went downhill from there.” Asked if he planned to operate a team this year, Borislow, in an e-mail message said: âIt depends if the women have a residency camp and they all get compensated more â as far as my team goes. I want to do what is best for the women and getting gold. I also believe that in World Cup and Olympic years, a professional league needs to play at a completely different time. Maybe a few weeks to a month afterwards. I have voiced this opinion very loudly before. Deal is a deal is a deal.â The league was also facing the prospect of losing national team players from the United States and Canada during the Olympics, beginning in July. Now, with W.P.S. on hiatus, responsibility for preparing the United States team for the Olympics will fall to the federation, which will have to pay for a series of residency camps and arrange international matches leading up to London. âAs for how this affects the Womenâs national teamâs preparation leading into the Olympics, we have had discussions with the coaching staff and will be increasing our programming over the next six months,â Sunil Gulati, the president of the federation, said in an e-mail message.
W.P.S. teams could also opt to join several minor, semipro leagues, like the W-League and the Womenâs Premier Soccer League. Though Hofstetter said he and Sky Blue have a good relationship with the U.S. federation, he said there has not been enough financial support for the league. “I don’t know if they share our vision, and for them just to state that the league is important would be hugely helpful,” he said. “Look what’s happening in Europe. In Germany the federation gives each team money, the same with the Dutch federation and in Norway. This is not going to take years, it will take generations. But the federation can’t just have a vision for the men, the women have a right to have a place, too.” Will this decision be a crippling blow for a Division I women’s pro league in the U.S.?
