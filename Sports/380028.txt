Advertisement  Some supervisors use a style called "hands-on management." Last night at Madison Square Garden, before the Rangers played the Chicago Blackhawks, Mike Chaykowsky tried "feet-on management." Chaykowsky, the manager of building operations for the Garden, put his skates on his feet and his feet on the ice to examine the repairs and improvements to his rink surface, which is being investigated by the National Hockey League. With two days to work on it between hockey games and no other events scheduled, Chaykowsky's crew made the necessary repairs. The workers painted a gray spot where white paint was scraped to reveal cement. They gave the playing surface a few extra sprays of water to make its thickness an even three-quarter inch. They used an "oxygen scavenger," which Chaykowsky said causes the ice to bubble "like Alka- Seltzer." The removal of oxygen, he said, makes the ice less likely to chip. Finally, he said, the Zamboni machine resurfaced the ice several times with purified, demineralized water. "We've fixed the problem; the ice looks like glass," Chayowsky said, adding that there was nothing wrong with the building's cooling pipes or ice-making equipment.
