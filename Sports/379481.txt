The Arizona Diamondbacks have a magic number of one to clinch the N.L. West. But they are taking no chances, acquiring a left-handed reliever, Mike Zagurski, from Philadelphia on Friday for a player to be named. The deal is a reminder that the trading season doesnât always end on Aug. 31. Players must be in an organization by that date to be eligible for the postseason roster, but if teams need a lift for September, they are still free to deal. So it was in 1987, when the Detroit Tigers waged a fierce battle with the Toronto Blue Jays for the American League East title. The Tigers trailed by a half-game on Sept. 22 when they acquired reliever Dickie Noles from the Chicago Cubs for a player to be named later. âSparky Anderson had said once that the only reason Dickie Noles was in the big leagues is because he throws at people,â said Noles, now the employee-assistance professional for the Phillies, referring to the Tigersâ manager. âThen I go there on Sept. 22, weâre playing the Red Sox at Fenway Park, and he brings me in in the ninth inning to get the save.â  Noles collected one more save in four games, helping the Tigers win the division. A month later, he was shipped back to Cubs General Manager Dallas Green â as the player to be named later in the deal. Essentially, then, Noles was traded for himself. âI had a funny feeling I was going to be that player,â Noles said. âI knew when the trade was made that there was no agreement on the player, and I knew Dallas was going to try to pull a pretty good arm out of it. The Tigers just werenât going to do it, and I know how Dallas is. Iâm sure he said, ‘Well, just give him back,â and they gave me back.â Other players have been traded for themselves, including infielder John McDonald, who was lent from Toronto to Detroit for two and a half months in 2005. McDonald would play six more seasons for the Blue Jays, but Noles never pitched again for the Cubs, who granted him free agency the month after getting him back. Green is now an adviser to Phillies General Manager Ruben Amaro Jr. You never know — maybe Zagurski will wind up back in Philadelphia.
