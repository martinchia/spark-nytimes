Advertisement  The Washington audience for the Giants-Redskins game was expected to be so big last night that the CBS affiliate in Washington gave up its rights to televise the last game of the World Series in order to carry the football game. Of course, the station, WUSA-TV, did not know when it opted for the Redskins game that there would definitely be a seventh Series game. Although the Redskins-Giants game was being carried on ESPN, home cities of teams on such cable-television games also receive them on over-the-air broadcasts as well. The World Series game was carried in Washington on WDCA-TV, an independent station with a smaller audience than WUSA's. In New York, it was the opposite. The network-affiliated station, WCBS-TV, broadcast the World Series game, while the Giants-Redskins game was on ESPN and a smaller local station, WPIX.
