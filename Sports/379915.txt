MINNEAPOLIS â Barring any setbacks, achiness, dizziness or rain, Alex Rodriguez could finally make his return to the Yankee lineup Sunday. After missing 38 games with a torn meniscus in his right knee, Rodriguez went through another rigorous workout Saturday and proclaimed himself ready. âI think so,â he said. âI think we all feel that way. My mouth is getting watery here, ready to play. Iâve watched enough baseball.â Because he left his minor-league rehabilitation assignment to join the team here Thursday, Rodriguez has not faced live pitching since playing for Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Wednesday. The longer it takes for him to return, the rustier he will get, so there is a small sense of urgency to get him into a game. The Yankees do not have a game scheduled for Monday, so if he does not play Sunday his next opportunity will come Tuesday against Oakland at Yankee Stadium. âIf you possibly wait until Tuesday, itâs five days between at-bats,â Manager Joe Girardi said. âSo weâll make a decision tomorrow, and itâs possible heâll be activated.â  Rodriguezâs workout at Target Field before Saturdayâs game against the Minnesota Twins consisted of running the bases and taking batting practice and fielding practice for a third straight day. âWeâve checked every box, pretty much,â Rodriguez said. When Rodriguez comes to the park Sunday morning, he will check in with Girardi, and if everything feels fine, Rodriguez will be the third baseman or the designated hitter. Rodriguez said which position he occupied was up to Girardi, but he was hoping for third base. âIâm pretty much ready to go,â he said. Rodriguez last played July 7 and will return with a .295 batting average, 13 home runs and 52 runs batted in 80 games. Going into Saturdayâs game, the Yankees were 25-12 without him.  REMEMBERING FIRST OF 600 It has been a whirlwind week for Twins designated hitter Jim Thome, who hit his 600th home run last Monday in Detroit. It was his 599th home run since his first, against reliever Steve Farr on Oct. 4, 1991, at a nearly empty Yankee Stadium. He spent some time Saturday reflecting on his first homer. âI remember that night like it was yesterday,â he said. âThere was nobody there. I hit it into the upper deck and somebody joked with me the other day that nobody even picked it up until the next day.â Thome recalled that he used Joel Skinnerâs bat, a Louisville Slugger T-141. A former Yankee, Skinner was then playing for the Indians in the final season of his career. âI remember him giving me his bat and saying: âLook for a fastball in. Heâs going to throw you a fastball in,âÂ â Thome said, âand it worked out.â For Thome, hitting his first home run at Yankee Stadium was something he appreciated. âIt was an honor to say that your first major league home run came at Yankee Stadium,â he said. âI donât think many people can say that, especially the old stadium with all the history, all the great players that came through. It was a neat experience, a neat experience.â  YANKEE FAN DONS PINSTRIPES The newly acquired left-handed reliever Aaron Laffey arrived in Minnesota and was activated for Saturdayâs game. After a terrific first half of the season with the Seattle Mariners, in which he had a 1.87 earned run average, Laffey has struggled, with an E.R.A. of 12.00 in the second half, surrendering 12 earned runs in nine innings. Teams have batted .447 (21 for 47) against him since the All-Star break. Laffey attributed his difficulties to too much rest between appearances. He also said he expected to do better in meaningful games. âIâm looking forward to coming here and starting fresh again and getting back into that rhythm and getting back into competitive games,â he said. Although he grew up in Cumberland, Md., Laffey said he was a lifelong Yankees fan, like his father, which made it very rewarding to join the team. âEvery kid dreams of playing for the New York Yankees and I was that kid,â he said. âNow that opportunity is here and itâs a dream come true.â He said his favorite players were Bernie Williams, Paul OâNeill and especially Don Mattingly. âMattingly was my all-time favorite,â he said.
