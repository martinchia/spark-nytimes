Selection Sunday is here â the day that we have all been waiting for. Joe Lunardi, the apparent âbracketologyâ guru, has generously provided us all a foundation of expectations. Everyone has been blogging and dropping Twitter bombs from the sky with their own opinions and predictions. The analysts are matching tournament resumes and trying to determine who deserves to be in and who deserves to be out, calculating R.P.I.’s and often using simply the transitive property â If we beat North Carolina, and North Carolina beat Duke, then clearly we are a No. 1 seed. That would be nice.    After an epic conference tournament season, the incredible moments and overtime finishes quickly become history when the bracket is announced Sunday. In the minds of most, the seeding is of prime importance. However, to us, the difference between a 6 seed and a 4 seed is minor. To be honest, I think I would rather be a 6 seed than a 4 seed. In the last six years, Vanderbilt has been to the tournament four times, with two appearances in the Round of 16. Twice we were a 4 seed and twice we were a 6 seed. The Sweet 16 appearances both came when we were seeded sixth, while the No. 4 seed led only to bitter first-round exits. Cursed?  So, what is really important to us on Selection Sunday? Personally, I am a stickler for location. How about the tropical weather of Tampa versus gloomy Cleveland? Rock and Roll Hall of Fame or poolside lounging with an iced tea and a tiny umbrella? Such a toss-up.  But, at the end of the day, it is the draw that is the most important. Sometimes, as made evident by the Butler Bulldogs last year, the tournament can just open up for you. This year, if we are a 5 seed, we may play a team like Colorado, which could be very dangerous. Or, if we are a 4 seed we might draw a stealthy midmajor like Belmont. Remember Duke three years ago? I am not sure which I would rather have, but I do know that when our number is called I probably will not care what the seed is, because just being in the Dance is an unexplainable feeling. If Vanderbilt is fortunate enough to be in, though, I wonât be mad if we are a 3 seed in Tucson. Just putting it out there.
