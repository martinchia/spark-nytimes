Advertisement  AP Dexter Nukes took the lead at the top of the stretch tonight and scored a convincing 1 1/2-length victory over Britt's Best in the final of the $500,000 New Jersey Classic. Dexter Nukes was never worse than second in pacing the mile in 1:53 2/5. The time was the third fastest in the race's 10-year history, and established the No Nukes colt as one of the top 3-years-olds in training. Dexter Nukes paid $3.80, $2.40 and $2.20 for $2 across the board as the favorite in the 10-horse field. The victory was worth $250,000 for the owner, Thomas A. Dexter of Upper Saddle River. As the field straightened out heading for the wire, John Campbell put Dexter Nukes on the lead and there was never a challenge. Britt's Best, who was last after the opening quarter-mile, responded to urging from Ron Pierce and swept past the field to finish second. The gelding paid $7.60 and $3.80 for $2. Goalie Jeff, a winner of one of last week's eliminations, overcame a slight break at the start to finish third. The Cam Fella colt, who finished 1 1/2-lengths behind Britt's Best, paid $3.60 to show.
