For Valentino Pascucci, who hit a game-tying, pinch-hit home run for the Mets against the Phillies in Game 1 of a doubleheader on Saturday, it has been a long journey since he was first drafted  in 1996 by the Milwaukee Brewers. He did not sign with the Brewers, and was subsequently drafted by the Montreal Expos in 1999. When Pascucci made his debut with the Mets this season on Sept. 8 against Atlanta, he singled in a pinch-hitting appearance. That hit extended his hitting streak to three games, picking up where he left off â in October 2004. Pascucci made his major league debut with the Montreal Expos on April 26, 2004, and was hitless in three at-bats against San Diego. He appeared in 12 games in April and May, was sent to the minors, and was called up in September. He finished that season with Montreal, collecting four hits in his final two games on Oct. 2 and 3, against the Mets. The game on Oct. 3 was also the last game in Expos history, before the franchise relocated to Washington. At the end of that season, Pascucci was released. Between then and when the Mets signed him in January, Pascucci was signed by five teams (including the Mets in 2008), released three times, and granted free agency three times. He also made stops in the Japan Pacific League (Chiba Lotte Marines); Pacific Coast League (Albuquerque Isotopes, New Orleans Zephyrs and Portland Beavers); International League (Lehigh Valley IronPigs and Buffalo Bisons); and the Atlantic League (Camden Riversharks). Another reason for Mets fans to like him: He shares a birthday, Nov. 17, with Hall of Famer Tom Seaver.
