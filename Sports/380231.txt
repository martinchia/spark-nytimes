Advertisement  NORM CHARLTON one of the Cincinnati Reds' once-notorious Nasty Boys, was suspended for seven days and fined for deliberately hitting the Dodgers' MIKE SCIOSCIA with a pitch -- and then saying he might even come after him again. The suspension, imposed by BILL WHITE, the National League president, was effective yesterday, but Charlton appealed, thereby making him eligible to pitch pending a hearing. The Reds were scheduled to begin a two-game series in Los Angeles last night. The incident occurred at Cincinnati on Sept. 9, after Charlton was angered because he believed that Scioscia, the Dodgers' catcher, was stealing signs. "I threw at him," Charlton admitted after the game. "I hit him on the arm. But I didn't mean to hit him on the arm. He'll be lucky if I don't rip his head off the next time I'm pitching." White, who would not reveal the amount of the fine, said yesterday that "Charlton was suspended for his comments admitting he deliberately threw at Mike Scioscia of the Dodgers and his threats concerning hitting Mr. Scioscia in the future." Charlton, ROB DIBBLE and RANDY MYERS formed an illustrious relieving trio last season in helping the Reds capture the pennant and then the World Series. This year, though, the Nasty Boys' act didn't play as well, nor did the Reds. Dibble, in fact, sought psychotherapy after several incidents in which he blew up on the field.
