Andreas Herzog has wound up his work with Austria’s under-21 national team and said Saturday that he is headed back to the United States to become part of Jurgen Klinsmann’s coaching staff with the national team. “Jurgen Klinsmann and I have been close friends for many years now,” said Herzog, according to The Associated Press, via a report on the Web site of the Austrian federation on Saturday. “I face this new challenge with great confidence.” The president of the Austrian federation, Leo Windtner, said: “For Andreas Herzog, this is a unique opportunity to present itself as a coach on the international stage. Therefore, we will put him on the part of the ÃFB no obstacles in the way, although we regret his departure and thank him for his work in recent years, naturally sincere. We wish Andreas heart of every success in his new job and in January next year will decide on his successor.” (Translated from German by Google.) Herzog, 43, and Klinsmann were teammates at Bayern Munich when the German club won the UEFA Cup in 1996. In addition, Herzog played one season, 2004, in Major League Soccer for the Los Angeles Galaxy when Klinsmann had taken up residency in Southern California with his family. Herzog is the career leader in international appearances for Austria, scoring 26 goals in 103 matches from 1998 to 2003 and playing in the 1998 World Cup in France. He played professionally for Rapid Vienna, Werder Bremen, Munich and the Galaxy. His coaching career got a kick-start when he worked with Austria’s national team under Josef Hickersberger and Karel Brueckner. He took over the under-21 squad in March 2009. Herzog has not had formal discussions with U.S. Soccer because it first wanted to obtain clearance from Austria, the U.S. federation spokesman Neil Buethe said Saturday. Buethe did say, however, that the Austrian federation had agreed to allow Herzog to pursue the opportunity, and that talks would begin soon.
