BOSTON â Alex Rodriguez received a cortisone shot Monday for his sprained left thumb and said he did not expect to play in any of the three games here against the Red Sox. But he held out hope that he could play Friday against the Toronto Blue Jays at Yankee Stadium. Rodriguez, who jammed the thumb fielding a ground ball in Minnesota on Aug. 21, aggravated it Sunday in Baltimore. He returned to New York on Monday and had a magnetic resonance imaging test that revealed a sprain. Rodriguez said doctors told him it was slightly higher than a Grade 1 sprain. He said he did not want to rule out the possibility of coming back for Thursdayâs game here, but added that he was told not to touch a bat for another two days. That makes a return for the Yankeesâ final regular-season game in Boston rather unlikely. âItâs miserable,â Rodriguez said of the notion he would not be able to play in this rivalry. Of Fenway Park, he added, âThis is one of my favorite places to play.â Rodriguez, who missed a series here earlier this month while he recovered from knee surgery, is a career .290 hitter at Fenway, with 22 home runs and 69 runs batted in over 104 games. Before Tuesday nightâs game against the Red Sox, Rodriguez took ground balls at third base with a wrap on his thumb, but he did not hit. He said the thumb did not bother him in the field, but he is unable to swing the bat without considerable discomfort. He said when he did start swinging again, perhaps on Thursday, he would reduce the number of swings in order to ease the strain and pressure on the thumb. âItâs more of a mental rhythm,â he said. âI know what Iâm doing out there. If I take 5 or 10 swings, Iâm ready to go.â Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said that the Yankees would try to ensure that Rodriguez was fully recovered before he returned so that he does not aggravate the injury. âWe want it to heal, and we believe it will heal,â Girardi said. âIt will take a few days, but we believe it will heal.â The timing of this injury has been particularly irritating to Rodriguez. After missing 38 games following arthroscopic knee surgery July 11, he had played in only four games before the thumb injury. And in addition to the thumb and the knee, Rodriguez has also dealt with a shoulder problem this year, and has played in only 84 games. âThis year has been the most frustrating of my career because Iâve had three different things going on at one point or another,â Rodriguez said. âBut my body feels really good. When Iâm healthy, I feel like I can do all the things that I did in April and in spring training. That was probably as good baseball as Iâve played in a long time. So if my health is there, I feel like I can play through anything.â Over the past few seasons, the nagging injuries have mounted for the 36-year-old Rodriguez. He has also dealt with injuries to his hip, calf and quadriceps, and has averaged only 133 games from 2008 through 2010. INCOMPLETE ROTATION Joe Girardi announced his starters for the first two games against the Toronto Blue Jays this weekend. He said Ivan Nova would pitch Friday and Bartolo Colon on Saturday. Presumably Freddy Garcia, who did so well Monday against the Baltimore Orioles, would pitch Sunday, but Girardi declined to say. He maintained he still planned to get the rotation down to five by next week. Phil Hughes, who pitches Wednesday, does have experience in the bullpen, but he promised he would not be thinking about pitching for his spot when he starts against the Red Sox. âI just go out there and pitch and not think about anything else,â he said. âThat makes it a lot easier on me. I donât have to worry about the other circumstances and just go out and focus on every pitch I throw.â The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
