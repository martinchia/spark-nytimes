Advertisement  Michael Cooper, the graceful defensive specialist who was a key performer on five National Basketball Association championship teams in the 1980's, parted company with the Los Angeles Lakers yesterday to seek a new basketball career in Italy. The Lakers' assistant general manager, Mitch Kupchak, said the Lakers placed Cooper, an 11-year veteran, on waivers at his own request. If Cooper, 34, is not claimed by another N.B.A. team, he would be free to sign a multi-year contract with the Italian League's Il Messaggero of Milan. Cooper had one year left on a contract reportedly worth $600,000 annually. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
