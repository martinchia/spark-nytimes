Roma might have been booed off its home field in a 3-2 loss to Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday, but there was nothing but praise for Arsenal and Barcelona after the Gunners’ 2-1 victory on Wednesday. A sampling of the principals’ reactions: ArsÃ¨ne Wenger, via Arsenal.com: On the game …
“The game promised a lot and absolutely fulfilled the promises between two exceptional football teams who always try to play.” On taking off Alex Song for an attacker â¦
“It was a mixture of the yellow card [he received] and because I wanted to go for it. We finished with Wilshere, FÃ bregas, Nasri, Bendtner and Van Persie — we needed to score two goals. We took a gamble and it could have backfired and we could have lost 2-0 or 3-0 to them. It worked.” On whether Arsenal are favorites in the second leg â¦
“We are not favorites. We believe we have a chance. Barcelona are still favorites and we know tonight that we can beat them — which we did not know last year.” Arsenal midfielder Cesc FÃ bregas “They are the best side in football’s history in my opinion. That is one game and this is halftime. It is a nice victory but that’s all. If we show it here and not the Camp Nou, it is nothing for us.” Arsenal striker Robin van Persie “If you drop back too much they are so good they will beat you. We had to beat them in their own style.” Barcelona Manager Josep Guardiola “We dominated and more or less controlled the game. It’s a pity that we lost but these things happen in football.” “In general I’m happy with the performance. It’s the result I don’t like.” Is it possible that the second leg will be even better? Barcelona wasn’t lacking for chances Wednesday, and it will face immense pressure to be even better at the Camp Nou. Guardiola, for one, predicts a “spectacular” return match. “They will attack and we’re going to attack, too,” he said. “If you have time and nothing to do I suggest you come and watch the game.” Corner kick: Arsenal’s victory was probably the highlight of the first four Round of 16 matchups, but what else impressed you this week?
