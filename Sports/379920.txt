Advertisement  CBS packaged figure skating and downhill skiing Sunday night and recorded a 23.4 Nielsen rating and a 33 share, significantly higher than its Saturday night rating of 14.5 and a 24 share for the opening ceremonies in Albertville, France. The Saturday night rating was nearly the same as ABC's opening ceremonies telecast for the 1988 Games in Calgary, which drew a 14.4 rating and a 35 share. Sunday night's rating for CBS was 19 percent higher than the first Sunday night of ABC's coverage at Calgary, which had a more varied but slightly less alluring package: speed skating, figure skating, hockey and luge. CBS's Sunday package easily outdrew the other networks, which featured the movies "Kindergarten Cop" on NBC and "The Burden of Proof" on ABC. No national numbers were available for NBC and ABC, but in comparisons based on preliminary overnight ratings for the night from 25 markets, CBS posted a 25.2, NBC, 17.1 and ABC a 10.9. Each national rating point equals 931,000 TV households. The share is the percentage of homes with televisions in use that are tuned to a specific program.
