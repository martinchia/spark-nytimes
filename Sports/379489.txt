JOHNS CREEK, Ga. â As a teenager, Phil Mickelson nurtured his golf game on the public Torrey Pines South course in San Diego, and he considered the design inviolate, down to the slope of the greens. But when the noted course toughener Rees Jones completed a configuration in 2001, Mickelson was no fan of the finished product. He seems to have never forgiven Jones, later disapproving of a makeover at another cherished greensward, Cog Hillâs Drubsdread in suburban Chicago. So it was hardly a surprise to hear Mickelson find fault Thursday with Jonesâs latest high-profile handiwork, the renovated Highlands course at Atlanta Athletic Club. But his criticism took an unusual tack. Mickelson deemed the layout a fair test for the pros, but not the hobbyists, particularly club members. He cited, as an example, the extra-long par 3s as âa perfect example of how modern architecture is killing the game, because these holes are unplayable for the member.â  âYou have water in front and you have a bunker behind, and you give the player no avenue to run a shot up,â Mickelson said. âThe average guy just canât play it.â Mickelson in some ways fancies himself the conscience of the weekend duffer, a fervent believer of âthe more, the merrier.â He claimed the number of A.A.C. member rounds at the Highlands had dipped by 25 percent, a byproduct of intimidation. âItâs every course throughout modern architecture,â he said before backtracking. âThere are some great ones, but the guy that redid this one, you know, itâs great for the championship, but itâs not great for the membership. âItâs the reason participation in this sport is going down.â Tom Adderhold, the clubâs general chairman and a charter club member, took issue with the complaint without directly addressing the alleged statistical decline. âPhil is not a member, so I donât know where he got his information,â said Adderhold, who indicated that the pace of rounds by guests has picked up. Regarding âthe guy,â as Mickelson referred to Jones, Adderhold said: âRees has just been tremendous. We were fortunate to have had Rees come in.â  To Adderhold, Jones achieved a dual mission: create a challenging test for the P.G.A. Championship, with its $7.5 million purse, and âan enjoyable venueâ for the regulars and their $2 nassaus. The length, he pointed out, will be shortened post-tournament once tees are repositioned.  Mickelson voiced no complaints with the courseâs MCAT-level difficulty for his peers, though he griped last week about the greensâ greased-skids quickness. âThe greens here are spectacular, and the fairways are the best Iâve ever seen,â he said Thursday after signing for a one-over 71.
