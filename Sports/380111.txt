Advertisement  Fay Vincent, the baseball commissioner, said yesterday that he would allow Steve Howe, the left-handed relief pitcher who was suspended from major league baseball four times from 1983 to 1988 for using illegal drugs, to play minor league baseball in 1990. The commissioner added that Howe would continue to be barred from the big leagues until 1991. Vincent met with the 31-year-old Howe on Feb. 8 to consider a request for reinstatement. ''While I believe that a lifetime ban from baseball is fully warranted in this case, I resolve the doubt raised by the conflicting medical and psychological opinions in Howe's favor and will offer him yet another chance to return to the game,'' Vincent said yesterday. If he chooses to play, Howe must participate in an aftercare program approved by the commissioner's office, Vincent said. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
