Chris Pronger, Sidney Crosby, Claude Giroux, Milan Michalek and now Jeff Skinner. The list of superstars having the dreaded label of being out indefinitely with a concussion continues to grow. By far, this has been the lead story in the N.H.L. over the last year. It began when Sidney Crosby was found to have a concussion in January. It took a backseat for a short while as Crosby returned to play in late November, but before anyone got comfortable, a slew of great players, including Crosby, have been sent to the press box to watch games, out indefinitely with concussions after all taking blows to the head.  What is the N.H.L. to do? That question has been bandied about in the hockey world for a while now, and there really is no clear-cut answer. We can talk about suspensions for blows to the head and fines for hits from behind. Those solutions will hopefully make the players think a little bit more before they barrel into an opponent and put a player in a dangerous situation. But it wonât make the concussion issue go away. Case in point: of the five players listed above, three of them, Crosby, Giroux and Michalek, collided with their teammates. Are you going to suspend them? Of course not, and therein lays the problem. You cannot make this game free of injuries. The sport is fast — a split second can turn a beautiful play into a terrible collision.  The stress of this type of injury is that there is no bottom line. The word indefinite is used when it comes to a concussion and the period of time a player will be sidelined, and that is what is causing fear around the N.H.L. Yes, a broken leg or a torn knee ligament are bad injuries and would hurt a team if one of their star players were afflicted. But at least those injuries have a bottom line to them. If you tear up your knee, you have surgery, you do rehabilitation, and eventually you will get back in a time frame that can be predicted. With concussions the rehabilitation is to sit around and wait and hope that the headaches go away or that the blurry feelings subside. It is a helpless feeling. I wish I didnât know what I was talking about when I describe those feelings, but I know them all too well. I also know the unpredictability and frustration behind them. In 2005 and again in 2006, while playing minor league hockey, I took blows to the head and was out indefinitely with concussions. The first came with a blindsided elbow that I did not see coming. It knocked me out cold, and the next thing I knew, I was waking up in a hospital bed. I was found to have a concussion, but the headaches and nausea were gone within a few days. I was back on the ice two weeks after the incident and feeling great. In 2006, while playing for the Johnstown Chiefs of the E.C.H.L., the second concussion occurred. This time I fell and hit my head on the ice. It caused a little bit of a dazed feeling and a headache, but it did not seem anywhere near as serious of an injury as the previous time. It was also diagnosed as a concussion, but, I thought to myself, I should be O.K. in a couple of days, after all I was able to get up on my own and skate off without help.  But this time the concussion kept me out for over a month. I could not shake the headaches and could not pass the concussion test on the computer. It was a frustrating and helpless feeling waking up hoping to have the headaches go away and just feel completely normal again. You try to stay in dark rooms as much as possible with little noise and all you do is think to yourself, when am I going to wake up and feel normal? Sharing these experiences is just a way to give a little perspective from the athleteâs point of view. After all, that is what this is about, making things safer for the players so they donât have to go through those types of feelings. With all that said, where can changes be made to decrease this problem? I say decrease because injuries and concussions are a part of this sport.  I have read many opinions and ideas on how to make the game safer. One that I heard by the ESPN analyst Barry Melrose was that they should make it a black-and-white issue on penalties for blows to the head. He believed that by making any hit to the head a penalty and suspension would create a standard that everyone would have to live up to. No gray areas on whether the player meant to do it or not. No gray areas on whether the player who receives the blow had lowered himself making it difficult to avoid getting struck in the head. No second guesses, you hit a player in the head, you are penalized, period. After thinking about it, that seemed as if it was the best way to attack the problem. Players would learn quickly as they begin to earn suspensions and lose paychecks that a hit to the head will not be tolerated. It would also alleviate any arguments from coaches or general managers because it would be much like shooting the puck over the glass and receiving a two-minute penalty. You may not like the call, but it is a clear-cut rule and arguing it would not change a thing. As far as off-the-ice improvements, it is clear that equipment needs to be geared more toward safety than comfort. In the past, the idea has been to make everything smaller and lighter so that a player can be more agile and faster on the ice. Well that is clearly not better for the safety of a player. The equipment, especially the helmet, should be geared toward safety and nothing else. In the past, a player might complain about the size or comfort of the helmet but after seeing what has gone on lately in the game, I am sure a player would take a little discomfort over losing his playing career altogether. As the league continues to research rule changes and seeks out the right adjustments to the equipment, they have to be wondering if there is some correlation between the post N.H.L. lockout game and the massive amount of concussions that is plaguing the league right now. Nobody can argue against the game being better and faster after all of the hooking and holding was taken out of the sport. More speed, more goals and more excitement for the fans.  But you have to start wondering, with players not allowed to hold up checks as forwards barrel in on a defenseman, does that elevate the chance of a more violent check? With no obstruction going through the neutral zone, does that lead to more high-speed collisions? With some, as we have seen lately, ending up with teammates colliding. It really is a tricky situation. You want the game to be fast and exciting, but at what cost? Certainly not the game’s most dominate and explosive players. To end on a high note, Giroux was able to shake free of his concussion symptoms and was back in the lineup for the Flyers Wednesday night against the Dallas Stars. It appeared as if there were no ill effects as he notched a goal and two assists. His indefinite injury lasted less than two weeks — we can only hope that all of the other players can have some luck like Giroux and get back on the ice and play the game they love.
