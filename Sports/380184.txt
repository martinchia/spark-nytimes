NO. 11 OKLAHOMA AT NO. 10 KANSAS STATE
3:30 p.m. Eastern, ESPN Although it received no votes in the preseason top 25, Kansas State has emerged as a national title contender. Facing Oklahoma on Saturday, and Oklahoma State, Texas A&M and Texas in the next three weeks, the Wildcats will have a chance to make a statement. They will meet an Oklahoma team that ought to be extra ornery after being upset at home by Texas Tech. The Wildcats have been winning with great defense and special teams and a bruising running game that controls the clock. They have beaten Miami and Texas Tech on the road and handed Baylor its first loss of the season. Still, the speed of Oklahoma receivers Ryan Broyles, right, and Kenny Stills on the outside may pose problems. Despite its 7-0 record, Kansas State is a hefty underdog at home.  NO. 9 MICHIGAN STATE AT NO. 13 NEBRASKA
Noon Eastern, ESPN After defeating Wisconsin thanks to a last-second desperation pass last Saturday, Michigan State is in control in the Big Ten Legends division. A victory this week in Lincoln would make the Spartans tough to catch. A win by Nebraska, however, would allow the Cornhuskers to control their chances in the division. Michigan State found a way to slow Michiganâs Denard Robinson and Wisconsinâs Russell Wilson, and now it will look to stop another dual-threat quarterback in Taylor Martinez. The Cornhuskers have one of the best rushing attacks in the nation, but one of the worst passing offenses. That could favor the Spartansâ defense, which has been great against the run this year. NO. 4 STANFORD AT NO. 20 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
8 p.m. Eastern, ABC/ESPN (Regional)  Everyone knows about Andrew Luck, but Stanford had 446 yards rushing in a 65-21 rout of Washington last Saturday, displaying its depth at running back and on the offensive line. It was the Cardinalâs first victory over a ranked opponent. The Trojans lost at Arizona State on Sept. 24, but have since won three in a row. Quarterback Matt Barkley and receiver Robert Woods are a formidable combination, and Barkley has been playing at a high level during the winning streak. Stanford has not been in a close contest yet; things could get interesting if the game is tight in the fourth quarter. U.S.C. is not eligible for postseason play, so expect the Trojans to treat this like a bowl game.
