Advertisement  Chicago Cubs slugger Andre Dawson will be a free agent at the end of the season and says he's intrigued by the idea of playing in his hometown for the Florida Marlins. "Miami would be a big possibility," said Dawson, who makes his home there. Cubs General Manager Larry Himes said Dawson would have plenty of options. "Andre will become a free agent, and he'll have 27 other opportunities," Himes said. "I'm sure there will be a lot of American League teams that will be interested." But Dawson, 38 years old, says he doesn't want to go to the American League to become a designated hitter; he would prefer to close his career in the National League. He reportedly asked the Cubs for a two-year extension, but the team told him to shop his services.
