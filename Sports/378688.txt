Advertisement  The Rangers aren't making any announcement yet, but it is expected that they will soon hire DAN MALONEY as an assistant coach. Maloney, formerly the head coach of Winnipeg and Toronto, would replace WAYNE CASHMAN, who left ROGER NEILSON's New York staff for a similar position with the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning. Maloney is no relation to DON MALONEY, the general manager of the Islanders. In an 11-year playing career with four teams, Dan Maloney had 451 points and 1,489 penalty minutes. He coached in Winnipeg from 1986-87 through part of the 1988-89 season. Before that, he coached the Maple Leafs in 1984-85 and 1985-86. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
