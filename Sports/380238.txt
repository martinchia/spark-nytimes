An analysis of a fourth-down call by Falcons Coach Mike Smith against the Saints has become almost an annual occurrence on the Fifth Down.
In December 2010, the Falcons punted, and the Saints won. Smith was criticized on The Fifth Down. 
In December 2008, the Falcons punted, and the Saints won. Smith was criticized on the Fifth Down.
 On Sunday, the Falcons did not punt on fourth down. And the Saints still won. Smith was criticized — again. Not that this will make him feel any better, but in this instance, the Fifth Down is defending Smith. Brian Burke of Advanced NFL Stats, a Fifth Down contributor, has the math and the explanation (below):
See the full post at his site, and also the comments, which advance the conversation.Â (The scene: In overtime, the Falcons, after initially deciding to punt, go for it on fourth-and-inches from their 29. Michael Turner is stuffed, and the Saints win a few plays later with a short field goal.) Calculating Win Probability (WP) in OT is surprisingly simple compared to regulation time. Except for the final few minutes when there is real possibility of a tie, time is not a factor and the score is always tied. A punt would be the conventional call. A typical punt from the 29 nets 38 yards, giving the Saints a first down at their own 33, worth 0.58 WP (a 58% chance of winning). This makes intuitive sense, because teams that win the coin toss are in a similar situation and win just under 60% of the time. The Falcons would therefore have a 0.42 WP following a punt. If the Falcons successfully convert the first down, they’d have a fresh set of downs at (at least) their own 30, good for a 0.57 WP. If the Falcons fail to convert, they’d hand the ball over to the Saints at their own 29, a nearly fatal situation, worth only 0.18 WP. I realize this is surprisingly high, but it reflects actual overtime game results. Often, coaches will conservatively run three times into a brick wall to set up a 40-plus-yard field goal, which is far from a slam-dunk. Conversions on 4th and 1 are typically successful 74% of the time. But this includes all 4th “and 1″ situations, everything from a yard-and-a-half to go to an inch to go. For now, let’s stipulate that it’s 74%. The total WP for the conversion attempt is: 0.74 * 0.57 + (1 – 0.74) * 0.18 = 0.47 The go for it option is worth, on net, a 0.47 WP. That’s better than the 0.42 WP of the punt option, at least according to league-average percentages. I’m certain the fact that Drew Brees and the rest of the Saints offense is not league-average helped sway Mike Smith’s mental calculus. Smart call. It just didn’t work out. Smith handled the postgame fallout well. He took full responsibility. Via The Associated Press, Falcons centerÂ Â Todd McClure said. âI like the fact our coach has faith in us to make the play.â Brees said: “It takes some steel and you-know-what to make that call. This one play is the game.â Smith referred to those games in which Brees drove the Saints to victory after the Falcons punted: “Itâs a matter of what has happened when we have played them in the past that is always part of the decision-making process. In previous games, in close games that weâve played them, weâve punted the ball and theyâve gotten the ball back with three minutes to go in the ballgame. We never saw it again, and they ended up winning the ballgame.” Smith didn’t win this time either, but he played the percentages, and if he keeps doing that, the wins will come. Extra point There is one issue with Smith’s decision in which he leaves himself open for second-guessing: Why did Atlanta go with a predictable run up the middle? Why not a quarterback sneak? Andy Benoit has a post on that topic this morning.
