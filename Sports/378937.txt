Now that Jorge Posada has followed Bernie Williams and Andy Pettitte into retirement, who is next: Derek Jeter or Mariano Rivera? Posada, in a playful moment during his news conference Tuesday at Yankee Stadium, announced that Rivera would be the one to quit after the 2012 season, a thought that would make most Yankees fans gasp â if it were true. âMariano said this is it,â Posada said. âHe said he has one more year, but Derek said heâs got like three more to go.â But Posada soon retracted his statement. âI donât think so,â he said, âespecially the way he keeps playing.â With his 44 saves last year, Rivera, 42, became the career leader with 603, and his 1.91 earned run average was three-tenths of a run lower than his career average. Clearly, he is still an elite closer.  Rivera, who is in the final year of a two-year, $30 million contract, was asked several times about when his moment might come, until he wondered why everyone was asking. He gave no indication. âThat day will come,â he said. âBut I donât know when.â Jeter is under contract until 2014, but he said that Rivera would outlast everyone. As for who would replace his good friend Posada as a locker mate in the clubhouse, Jeter said he would take it into consideration. âIâll look at the rÃ©sumÃ©s,â he said.
