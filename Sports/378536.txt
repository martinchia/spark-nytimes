When the Rangers finally get off the road at the end of this month, Mike Rupp wants to do more than think about and play hockey.
âThe game is my job,â said Rupp, who signed with the Rangers as a free agent in July after two seasons with the Penguins. âI never lose sight of that. But I donât feel like Iâm in this world just to play hockey. The N.H.L. has provided me with a great livelihood, but I also have a platform to make a difference.â
A 6-foot-5, 230-pound power forward and frequent fighter, Rupp is also one of the most civic-minded players in the league. He and his wife, Christi, are not interested in just showing up for photos opportunities for charities. Last Christmas, the Rupps wanted to do more for the families they had connected with through the Ronald McDonald House of Pittsburgh. One day after practice, they rented a bus to take 40 people to Ohio for a âPolar Expressâ train ride â complete with Santa, presents, dinner and Mike and Christi serving chocolate chip cookies and milk.
âYou should have seen the faces of these children,â said Becky Magnelli, the assistant family director with Ronald McDonald House. âWhat Michael and Christi and their own children did for these families was one of the most beautiful things any of us had ever seen. They are special people,â she said.
In Pittsburgh, Rupp and his wife became close to a 12-year-old boy named Austin, who died last year of bone cancer. Austinâs death hit home with the hockey player, who has three children â Maddie, 8, Mason, 6, and Max, 2 â with Christi.
âAustin was such a good kid,â said Rupp. âWe learned so much about whatâs important from being around him.â
The Rupps sponsor nine children internationally through McDonald House. Christi leads the way in all efforts. âMike has a level of fame as an N.H.L. player,â she said. âI donât care about riding his coattails to help people.â They encourage their young children to participate; Maddie and Mason use birthday and holiday money to buy Silly Bandz as their contribution to care packages. When Nicole Cleland, a woman from South Park, Penn., lost her 7-year-old daughter and unborn child and suffered serious injuries when her car was struck by a drunk driver, Mike lined up members of the Penguins and Pittsburgh Pirates for an autograph session to raise money for a family fund. 
The Rangers recently returned from two weeks in Europe and leave for four games over 10 days in Western Canada after facing the Islanders in Uniondale on Saturday. Because of renovations at Madison Square Garden, the teamâs home opener is not until Oct. 27. Rupp, 31, is eager to immerse his family in local charities when the Rangers finally have a stretch in New York. He favors programs like the Ronald McDonald House that assist families affected by illness and injury.
âWhen a child is seriously ill, the last thing you want to worry about are the bills and whether thereâs food on the table,â said Rupp after Rangers practice on Wednesday. âIf we can help these people sleep peacefully for a few hours and not fret over other issues, we should.â
Rupp is a  former first-round pick with good skills for a big man. He scored the Stanley Cup-clinching goal for the Devils in 2003 and averaged 11 goals in his two seasons with the Penguins. But coaches count on him to use his large frame to create space for his linemates and engage in fights with opposing heavyweights.
Maddie and Mason are aware that their dad participates in fights as part of his job, but the young children play their own games around the house when the Rangers hit the ice. âAt home, the game is usually on the TV, but just as background,â Rupp said. âThey know when weâve won or if Iâve scored a goal.â
On Wednesday morning, before practice, Rupp brought his children to school. One of their teachers noticed the skin damage left by what hockey players call âjersey burnâ around Rupp’s collarbone. He likely suffered it in a fierce tussle in Stockholm with George Parros, the enforcer of the Anaheim Ducks. Said Rupp, âI do wonder what people think sometimes. Dad doesnât have the typical job.â
But he said he does not feel compromised by the fighting. âThe way Iâve always looked at it is, I have to provide something for my team that the other guys do not,â said Rupp, who has a three-year, $4.5 million contract with the Rangers. âI feel Iâm a good skater. Iâve got pretty good skills for a player my size. But thereâs just too much talent around the league and in this organization. I have no problem stepping up to fight if I have to.  I have to establish myself and earn respect for my team. I understand thatâs why Iâm here.â
In the N.H.L., where many coaches insist the game is life just as religiously as their brethren in football, Rupp has to make sure his outside activities â however altruistic â do not affect his preparation and performance. 
âThe only time my play has suffered is when hockey is all I was thinking about,â said Rupp, who spent part of the 2010 offseason with other pro athletes on a mission in Haiti. âSometimes you need something different. You need to put this platform to good use. Hockey is hard. Hockey can break your heart, believe me. No one cares about winning more than I do, but perspective is important. The charity work with Christi has made me a better hockey player. I have no doubt about that.â
