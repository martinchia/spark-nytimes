He wasnât the most popular manager in the game. Matter of fact, maybe he was the least popular. But I love Tony La Russa. Some managers â paging Joe Girardi and Buck Showalter â make moves ostensibly intended to win a game but often seem as if theyâre really made to show us just how smart they are. La Russa  had that rep â or rap â but I see it differently. Over the decades he wasnât trying to show us how smart he is: he was more like a mad scientist who couldnât stop devising ingenious â or harebrained â plans. This is the guy who often batted his pitcher eighth. The guy who several years ago came up with the idea that an injured Albert Pujols could play left field, even though he was unable to throw, and just flip any ball hit to him to the center fielder, who would get it back to the infield. Not exactly the best thing to do with your franchise player, but I have to admire the totally out-of-the-box â or in-the-strait-jacket â thinking. And did he ever go out in style. Game 7, Friday night, top of the ninth. He brought in his closer, Jason Motte, to close out the World Series with a 6-2 lead. Looking ahead, if the Rangers got anything going the rejuvenated Josh Hamilton was looming as a batter with men on base and the game on the line.  So what was La Russa thinking about? Putting Motte in the outfield and bringing in a lefty to face the left-handed Hamilton. âNever done it before,â La Russa said after the game, although in the past he occasionally did station a pitcher in the outfield when short on players and aiming for the right matchup. And how was he going to prepare Motte for this adventure? âI was going to ask him, âDo you like left or right better?ââ  Hamilton never came to bat, so La Russa didnât have the chance to make the move. But he was thinking about it. In the ninth inning of Game 7, the last game he was ever going to manage.  Crazy? Maybe. But like a high school teacher once told me, I’d rather see an intriguing wrong answer than a boring right one.
