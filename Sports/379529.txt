Since 2001, not only have we been able to count on death and taxes, but also the fact that Albert Pujols would finish the season with a .300 or higher batting average, 30 or more home runs and 100 or more runs batted in. While he took care of the 30 home runs early this season, hitting his 30th on Aug. 16th, the remarkable slugger has left fans guessing if heâd be able to attain the other two milestones. He is one of a number of players who have some goals heading into the last day of the regular season. With a 1-for-5 performance last night, Pujolsâ batting average sits at exactly .300 (or .299651 for those with calculators.) If he receives four at-bats tonight, heâd need two or more hits to stay above his familiar benchmark. It is highly unlikely that he would sit out to maintain his average, considering the Cardinals are still in contention for the wild card, but even if that were not the case, he still has work to do as far as R.B.I. are concerned. Sitting at 98, he is five short of his career low of 103 that he set in 2007. The fact that he has missed 16 games this season obviously has not helped, but Pujols will undoubtedly be pressing hard to avoid his first non-triple-digit season. Of course, Pujols isnât the only player looking to hit various milestones. 40 home runs After hitting three home runs in a win over the Pirates Tuesday, giving him 38 for the season, Prince Fielder is tied with Matt Kemp for the National League lead. Neither player has much of a team incentive Wednesday, but Kemp should be highly motivated since he has already collected 40 stolen bases and could join Jose Canseco, Alex Rodriguez, Barry Bonds and Alfonso Soriano in the 40-40 club. .300 batting average Pujols isnât the only player on the fence batting average-wise. As Alan Schwarz wrote for the Times, players seem to do anything they can to avoid a .299 season. With one game to go, Jhonny Peralta and Fielder are at exactly .299 and history shows they will do whatever it takes to avoid that fate. 200 strikeouts Mark Reynolds is perhaps the greatest hitter in the history of the game at striking out. He holds the single-season record with 223 in 2009 and has had 200 or more in each of the last three seasons. With one game to go he is at 195 and is a platinum sombrero away from four in a row. 30 home runs, 100 R.B.I. While Pujols is on the verge of extending his 10-season streak of 30 home runs and 100 R.B.I., Alex Rodriguez has a little farther to go to extend his own 13-season streak of the same numbers. Currently at 16 home runs and 62 R.B.I., Rodriguez will need a little help from his teammates to get the 14 at-bats necessary (and some help from the pitchers to hit home runs in each of those at-bats.) Unfortunately for Rodriguez, the most at-bats a player has ever received is 11, though five players have received 12 plate appearances (most recently Rudy Law, Carlton Fisk and Harold Baines who all got 12 plate appearances for the White Sox in a 25-inning win over the Brewers in 1984.
