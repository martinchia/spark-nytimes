Fifty years ago, if the Giants were headed to Green Bay to play the Packers in the postseason, fans in New York might have considered themselves lucky to catch the game on television. Today, with tickets available online and frequent-flier miles accruing with every credit-card purchase, fans can dare to dream a little more boldly. Six members of a Chatham, N.J., softball team â a mix of lawyers, Wall Streeters and computer software salesmen â traveled to Lambeau Field for Sundayâs showdown between the Giants and the Packers. It was a trip of cheap hotel rooms and high hopes, cramped rental cars and unexpectedly good seats at the game. They were joined by two pals in Milwaukee. We left Milwaukee at 10:30 a.m. with the eight of us eagerly anticipating the finale of our long week of planning and looking forward to the Giants and the Packers playing at Lambeau. The drive to Green Bay is about two hours from Milwaukee, and we piled into two cars from our hotel with a ton of energy and a little trash talking between the Giants and Packers fans among us. When I made this trip four years ago with my friend Wilson, we stopped off in a small town just outside Green Bay called Denmark that Wilsonâs friends would visit before games to break up the drive and to soak in the Northern Wisconsin dedication to their beloved Packers. I made sure we revisited this spot on this trip so my friends from home could experience the feeling of pulling into Denmark and going to the roadside bar called Rookies, where the locals greeted us with both âGo Pack Goâ chants and drinks on the house.  Denmark is only about 30 minutes outside of Lambeau, so with high spirits and a ton of optimism despite our coming matchup versus the No. 1 seed in the N.F.C., we pulled into Green Bay around 1 p.m. Wilson knew all the tricks for avoiding traffic and getting into the right parking lot â we ended up at a Lutheran church that charged $20 as a charity fund-raiser â and before we knew it we were heading to the tailgate parties. Along the way, we saw a surprising number of Giants fans. We walked around the parking lots for a while, just to get a feel for the atmosphere at Lambeau. We then settled on the Stadium View bar which had an outdoor tailgate that included a mechanical bull and a tent with heaters and a D.J. We spent our two hours of pregame at the bar, making friends with Giants and Packers fans alike, including a Packers fan wearing a Greg Jennings jersey who rode the bull while wearing a crown made of plastic foam cheese. When I came to Lambeau four years ago, I got chills when we pulled up to the stadium. The experience of seeing it from the outside, and then as we walked in, is truly unique. We started off the first quarter on a high that did not subside for the next few hours, given the way the Giants played. The game itself was obviously phenomenal â the Giants showing that they are a team that is peaking at the perfect time â and from a visiting fanâs perspective, we could not have been in a better place. I had the exact same experience in 2008 â the Packers fans rooted relentlessly for their team, but they were incredibly gracious and hospitable to the Giants fans that had invaded their turf. As the final seconds ticked off the clock and it became clear the Giants were advancing to the N.F.C. championship game, the Packers fans began to clear out. All the Giants fans on the visiting sideline spontaneously drifted to the lower rows behind the team bench and began celebrating. Cheers of âLet’s go Giantsâ grew louder and louder until Justin Tuck came over and acknowledged the road warriors in Green Bay by waving his arms and firing us up even more than we already were. After the game, I was surprised and psyched to see a scene similar to what I had experienced after the Giants won here in 2008 â the Packers fans had emptied the stadium and the Giants fans had taken over. High-fives and hugs all over the place â total strangers embracing each other in celebration of an unlikely win at a huge point in what we hope is a championship season. The trip as a whole has been even better than we imagined as we booked our airfare, hotel rooms and tickets. We were all friends and teammates on the Towne Tavern softball team in Chatham, but now we have a lifelong bond to share â our night in Milwaukee, our incredible experience at Lambeau â and we understand how fortunate we are to have represented Giants fans on this adventure. To top it all off, we brought back a victory. When the Giants win it all in the Super Bowl, we will raise a toast to our time in Wisconsin and to our contribution to their championship season.
