INDIANAPOLIS â Can you name all 12 schools in the SEC? Could you have done it when you were six years old and had your big brother rapping his knuckles on your chest? That, apparently, is what a young Eli Manning endured when his big brother Peyton wanted to torment him. âIt was a great learning technique,â Eli said. âI donât suggest anyone else try it out but it definitely made me learn the schools of the SEC. Once I figured those out, he moved on to all 28 teams in the N.F.L. at that point. Then once I figured that out, the one I never got was the 10 brands of cigarettes.â Both at Mondayâs arrival press conference and then again during Tuesdayâs Media Day, Eli was besieged by questions about Peyton, whose status with the Indianapolis Colts remains up in the air. Ever diplomatic, Eli has refrained from making any proclamations about Peyton’s future and even said he has no plans to see Peyton â or many other family members â as this week goes on. That just plays into the Giants’ attempt to keep this Super Bowl trip as business-oriented as possible. Eli did talk at length, however, about what it was like growing up with two brothers (Cooper, 37, is the oldest; then Peyton, who is 35; and then Eli, 31). Essentially, he said, it was constantly competitive and he believes that has helped him be as successful as he has been in the N.F.L. âWhen I got a little bit older, 15 or 16 years old, we could finally start being on the same level and compete in playing basketball, ping pong or pool,â Eli said. âCompetition is a great thing. It brings out the best in people. It does make you work harder to try to get to that level where you can compete with your older brother who plays at that same level. It is definitely helpful in bringing out all my skills.â The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
