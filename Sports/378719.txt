Judy Battista, who covers the N.F.L. for The Times, answers readersâ questions: Watching the Sunday night game last week and the offensive pass interference calls: Is this like holding, where they call it when they feel like it? This has to be the most controversial call being made right now. They let some teams get away with it on both sides of the ball and in the same game call it on the other. What is your feeling? –Casino16, Indianapolis  Officiating has been, and always will be, uneven from game to game and from officiating crew to officiating crew (thatâs being diplomatic, but there are clearly some crews that are very good and some that struggle). But I generally do not think that officiating crews let some teams get away with infractions and others not within the same game â they are either calling pass interference, for example, closely in a game or theyâre not. There is going to be a lot of argument about the protections quarterbacks and receivers get, but those are the way the league wants the game called â they want to protect what they consider defenseless players and they certainly like the high scoring that results.  Certainly weâve seen some terrible calls or at the very least very marginal calls that have altered the direction of the game. But I do think you have to remember that officials are making close calls at very high speed. They do not have the benefit of slow-motion instant replay like the rest of us do. When you step back, Iâm often surprised by how often they are correct, and how they see things at full speed that the rest of us havenât. I canât tell you how often I look at a play at full speed and think âthereâs no interferenceâ and then on the replay you see the defender ever so subtly hooking the receiver. Oops. The official got it right. I donât envy their job at all.   Curiously sports journalists have stopped discussing the “Is Eli an elite QB”? subject. The media was quick to reject Eli but after his performance this season why won’t they admit he was right in his comment?  Iâm not sure what journalists youâre referring to, but Eli is a constant source of material in New York. I donât think there is any questions heâs playing at an elite level this year, and the Giants would likely shudder to ponder where they would be without him. The running game has been erratic, the receivers have had their injury pangs, and the defense has often been a mystery. The one constant for the Giants â and the reason that they are in any kind of playoff race â is Eli.  Say Denver beats New England next week, does that give them the momentum to propel them deep into the playoffs? And if Denver does make the playoffs, what is Tebow’s future with the team?  Let me do the second question first. I think Tebowâs future with the team is already settled: at the very least, he gets a chance to compete to be the starter next year. There is no way that he can not be considered for the job, no matter how unorthodox he is, no matter how many times John Elway cringes at Tebowâs ugly passing style, with the win-loss record going in his favor the way it has, even if they fail to make the playoffs. The Broncos will spend a considerable amount of time working with him in the off-season on his mechanics and they will hope that helps. I canât imagine they donât also acquire another quarterback to compete for the job, though  â either by drafting a rookie or signing a free agent.  Now, about the playoffs. Let me start by saying that I think theyâll win the A.F.C. West, but I donât think they will make a deep run. Inevitably in the playoffs they will face the best teams â with defenses capable of deciphering the option, and certainly capable of scoring bunches of points, which would put extreme pressure on the Broncos to keep up by passing. The option has been confounding to many teams, but against very good defenses (like Detroitâs and the Jetsâ) the Broncos have struggled (the Jets lost on the final drive in large part because they were gassed). As more game film becomes available, defenses are likely to have more success slowing the option and forcing Tebow into more conventional passing plays. That is to the opponentâs advantage, even though last week Tebow was much more successful passing.  I just donât see them being successful repeatedly against the likes of the Ravens, Steelers, Patriots, etc. Could they win the wild card round? That depends on the matchup. But I would doubt that if they get into the divisional round and have to face the best teams in the conference they can prevail.  One more thing: I donât think the Broncos will beat the Patriots. But Iâve been wrong before about them and Iâm crawling under my desk now so the Tebow Tribe doesnât hurt me.  If another Giants o-lineman goes down, is there anyone left on the bench?  Bring back two-way players, I say. Actually, I thought the offensive line looked pretty good against the Packers. They seemed more powerful and in control of the line of scrimmage in that game than they have in weeks and that was with all kinds of shuffling of personnel going on: David Diehl at left tackle with Will Beatty out for the season, Kevin Boothe at center and Mitch Petrus at left guard. And the Boothe/Petrus moves were made just hours before kickoff when it was determined that David Baas couldnât play. Having said that, get well soon, Stacy Andrews â pulmonary embolisms arenât funny and heâs lucky the Giants reacted so quickly. Heâs on injured reserve. The Giants, by the way, signed Tony Ugoh â who was a second round pick of the Colts in 2007, but who most recently was in the U.F.L. â to take Andrewsâ roster spot.  What evidence is there that the lack of off-season work and shorter pre-season has caused additional injuries? There sure seem to be a lot of injuries this season.  Good question and one Iâm sure the N.F.L. is looking at. I thought it was pretty glaring when we had the rash of Achillesâ tears during training camps that it was a result of the lack of off-season work. As one orthopedic surgeon explained it to me, thatâs an injury you see in weekend warriors who maybe have taken the winter off and then on the first nice day, pick up their tennis racquet and head for the court.  But since then, itâs hard to determine if itâs the lack of off-season work that is responsible. Also, itâs difficult to tell before the end of the season if injuries are any greater this year than in other years. Is a popped A.C.L. the result of a lack of work? Doubtful.  Also, every year we think there are a lot of injuries but what weâre really reacting to is a lot of high-profile injuries. In any year in which a lot of quarterbacks get injured, for example, there is a big hue and cry about injuries being greater than ever. Injury numbers generally hold steady from year to year with the occasional aberration. The N.F.L. studies injury rates very closely to see if there is something going on â a few years ago, there was a weird uptick in foot injuries and they looked at whether footwear was to blame, for instance. Weâll know after the season if injuries are truly up. But at this point in the season I think itâs safe to say that the cause is not the lack of off-season work.  I have been a Jets fan since the late 1960s, and this team has never had a head coach like Rex Ryan. He is not afraid to let others know what is on his mind. This must make covering the team fun for reporters. I personally like his enthusiasm, but wonder if his pre-season Super Bowl predictions and talk about being “dangerous” in the playoffs distracts the team. Do you think Rex’s comments help or hurt the Jets?  I think they mostly help the team â they certainly rally the troops and keep their confidence level up and Jets players can never, ever doubt that Rex has their back. Also, Rex has been great for the general profile of a franchise that has long been one of the leagueâs doormats and that has existed in the long shadow of the Giants in their own town. And letâs face it â theyâve backed him up in the last two years. You do wonder how long the bluster works, though. All coaches run their course with teams and while Rex has worked wonders so far, you wonder if â for instance â they fail to make the playoffs this year, does the big talk start to wear thing with players. But for now Iâd say Rex knows all the right buttons to push with his team.  How can you possibly explain the difference in the Giants’ performance against the Saints and Packers?  If I could, maybe I could get Tom Coughlin to hire me at a very high price. First, keep in mind that the Saints have generally given the Giants a tough time in recent years â itâs a bad matchup, and the Saints are terrific on turf. I have no explanation for why the Giants looked so flat and non-competitive at some points in the game, though. Thatâs inexplicable and inexcusable.  As for the Packers game, you could see that one coming from a mile away, couldnât you? I figured they would play well â they were at home, they were in a do or die game and they knew they had been humiliated on national TV the week before. Professional athletes have an enormous amount of pride and they did not want to repeat that performance.  The Packersâ defense had been vulnerable to deep passes all season and the Giants went right at them. Immediately you could see the confidence build in the Giants after the very first drive. It happens to a lot of teams. How else do you explain the same Saints team that blew the Giantsâ doors off losing by 10 points to the Rams? The Giants have always given Green Bay trouble whenever they play. It’s the one team the Packers would gladly avoid if they could. They beat them twice in a row for the N.F.L. championship but ever since, the Giants have become a thorn in their side.  Agreed that the Giants probably donât want to see the Packers again. But they probably would like to avoid the Saints, too. The Packers have been vulnerable to deep passes and both the Giants and Saints can do those. Then again, the Packers are playing at such an extremely high level on offense â and Aaron Rodgers is simply on another planet — that they might not care who they face; they figure they can outscore everyone and they might be right.  My circle of friends and family includes a great number of sports fans who are liberal, well-educated, middle class, etc. One hallmark of liberals is that we spend a lot of time analyzing our hobbies and patterns of consumption and develop guilt complexes soon after. Pro football provides a perfect example of such a moral quandary because itâs both incredibly entertaining and incredibly destructive for the people who provide that entertainment. (For another example, think about the wage slaves in developing nations who make our amazing electronics. The list goes on). Even within The New York Times, there has been a lot of excellent coverage recently about brain trauma from repeated concussions, and even the more âmundaneâ trauma that offensive linemen endure (the Kris Jenkins story) sounds terrible. To get to my question, if the N.F.L. presents such a dilemma to even casual fans, what does it do to professionals like yourself who are bound to it? What would you say to a fan who might say goodbye forever to the sport because of these objections? Does the fact that the pro athletes enter into the sport with full knowledge of its dangers somehow make watching it OK?  This is an interesting question. Letâs start with the obvious: injuries are awful and itâs difficult to watch players hobble off the field. But Iâll add this: I know coal miners suffer debilitating illness, too, and I worry more about their ability to get proper care than I do professional athletes, because they donât have the financial wherewithal or the national attention that athletes do. And I worry much, much more about high school players and younger whose coaches pressure them to play through injury either because they are ruthless or just clueless, because those players do not have the knowledge or the power to say no.  All sports carry a certain injury risk, and yes, the fact that professional athletes enter into it willingly â in fact, they battle to enter into it — and repeatedly chose to ignore the risks and play through injury and pain and cash the very large paychecks they receive as compensation for ignoring the risksâenters into the fact that I worry less about them than I worry about the risks borne by others.  That is not to say that I donât worry about the toll this sport and other sports takes on players. And it certainly is not to suggest that players should not fight for the best possible benefits and care. They absolutely should â they are in a position with some power, and they should exercise it to the fullest. Nobody wants to see injuries and, obviously, every possible precaution should be taken to minimize them. But I keep going back to the hue and cry when the league cracked down on hits to the head last year. That outrage wasnât coming from fans. It was coming from players, who said they knew they the risks they took and they had willingly accepted it. If they do not have reservations about playing because of the risks, then I donât think fans are compelled to be reluctant to watch.  I have been thinking about this more and more. I know it’s probably not a  “Judy Battista Has Answers” one-paragraph-response topic, but I would be very interested to see some New York Times-quality discussion on the ethics of fandom to a sport as physically damaging as the N.F.L  See above. And I guess Iâd add that this question should apply to some other sports , too â off the top of my head, auto racing and boxing and hockey.  Why did Fox get to carry last Sunday’s Broncos-at-Vikings game? I thought CBS carries A.F.C. teams when they play an N.F.C. team on the road.  Long, convoluted story. But here goes. When the Lions-Saints game was taken by NBC for the Sunday night broadcast last week, Fox lost an N.F.C .game. That left Fox with only two 1 p.m. games, while CBS had seven. In an unprecedented decision, the N.F.L. â which is the final arbiter of when games get played â moved the Broncos-Vikings game to Fox to increase the coverage area of the nine games being played at 1 p.m. That did not thrill CBS, because it lost out on the Tebow tidal wave. And itâs part of the reason CBS fought so hard not to lose next weekendâs Patriots-Broncos game to NBC. That game will remain on CBS at 4:15.  Based on last year’s performance, what team (Colts aside) in your opinion has been the most disappointing this year? What teams do you see next year having the greatest turnaround (a la the 49ers this year)?  I guess Iâd go with the Rams as the biggest disappointment, since I think I chose them to win the N.F.C. West (Iâm afraid to go back and look at my preseason predictions, but Iâm sure someone will remind me of how wrong I was) and they nearly made the playoffs last year. This year, they have just two victories. The team has been wracked by injuries since training camp started, but Sam Bradford also seems to have taken a step back under Josh McDaniels, his new offensive coordinator. Iâd certainly expect better things from them next year, but I fear that another coaching overhaul â if thatâs what the Ramsâ new owner Stan Kroenke decides to do — will set Bradford back further. Itâs not an accident that the most successful quarterbacks in the N.F.L. have had continuity in offensive systems throughout their careers.  Another disappointment: the Bucs, who won 10 games last season and this year have only four wins. The defense is one of the worst in the league and Josh Freeman is struggling. Thatâs not what anybody expected from a team that appeared to be young and on the rise.  So looking over the rest of Denver’s schedule, the toughest game they have left is the game against the Pats. Say Tebow beats the Pats, do you think they will have the momentum to carry them deep into the playoffs?  See above answerâ¦ The Giants and Jets play each other this month. Won’t it be delicious if making the playoffs is at stake for both teams and the loser will not make it?  That would be ideal and it is certainly possible, although if either team loses a game before then, that game could also be meaningless to both teams. That would be ugly.
