Brandon Jacobs scored on a 1-yard touchdown in the final minute and defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul blocked a field goal attempt on Dallas’s final play as the Giants held off the Cowboys, 37-34, on Sunday night. With their season on the line, the Giants erased a 12-point deficit in the final 3 minutes 14 seconds as Eli Manning led two late scoring drives. Manning passed for 400 yards with 2 touchdowns, and Jacobs finished with 101 yards rushing and 2 scores. Tony Romo threw four touchdown passes for the Cowboys, but he overthrew an open receiver behind the defense with 2:20 remaining â a throw on which even a first down most likely would have sealed a victory. Instead the Cowboys were forced to punt, and Manning coolly led the Giants 78 yards in just over a minute for a 37-34 lead. Manning had thrown an 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jake Ballard on the Giants’ previous possession to begin the comeback. The game featured eight lead changes. The victory, which ended a four-game losing streak, pushed the Giants (7-6) into a first-place tie with the Cowboys (7-6) atop the N.F.C. East. But more important, it left the Giants in control of their playoff hopes heading into three season-ending games at MetLife Stadium â against the Redskins, the Jets and the Cowboys. Winning all three will assure them the division title and a playoff spot. Read on for live coverage of the game.



11:53 P.M. FINAL — Pierre-Paul Saves the Day!!
 What a night for Jason Pierre-Paul. Got the Giants 2 points with the safety in the first quarter, and prevented 3 with the blocked field goal in the final seconds. In between he tortured everyone the Cowboys put in front of him. The Giants escape, 37-34, by kneeling out the final second. They are tied with the Cowboys atop the division at 7-6, but hold the tie-breaker — and control their playoff destiny — by virtue of tonight’s victory. What a game. Eli Manning passed for an even 400 yards, with 2 scores, and Brandon Jacobs rushed for 101 yards and 2 touchdowns.  Bailey’s kick is waaay short — Pierre-Paul may have blocked it. Coughlin, like Garrett a week ago, calls time as Bailey kicks. He’ll have to try again. He gets Austin for 20, Jones for 6, and then finds Austin again over the middle at the Giants 31. They rush up to spike it, and then run out Bailey for a 47-yarder with six seconds left. Boy, you had to think the Giants were done when Bryant got behind the defense to make it a 12-point lead. Now they’ll need to scramble just to get in position to try a tying field goal. The way momentum has swung tonight — that was the ninth lead change by my count — odds are they’ll get Bailey on the field at least. Whether he makes it or not? We’ll see. Ware runs in the 2-point conversion to give the Giants a 3-point lead at 37-34, and just like that the Giants’ fortunes have turned. Jacobs is stuffed on first-and-goal, but the Cowboys might have been better off letting Jacobs score there, especially if he’s going to get in. They call their last timeout, but it doesn’t matter: Jacobs rumbles over the right side for the go-ahead score with 46 seconds left. Romo must be kicking himself, though he’ll have less than a minute to save himself. A defensive holding penalty on Frank Walker (sabotage by the ex-Giant?) erases an ugly left-handed incompletion by Manning on second-and-10 from the 24. Given a second chance, and a first down, Manning hits Ballard at the goal line and he falls at the 1. Dallas calls timeout with 1:00 left. Manning leads Manningham perfectly at the goal line and he drops a pass a million high school players could have made. Aaaarghhh. Manning lets a bad snap get past him, and the Giants cover at the 50. Horrible snap, high and wide right. But Ware lined up in the neutral zone, and the Giants get a huuuuuge break. Manning hits Ballard for 21 yards to the Dallas 37 and the game arrives at the two-minute warning. Could Romo have made a bigger mistake than his former teammate Marion Barber did in Denver earlier today? This will be a Tebow-like escape if Manning can pull it off. Miles Austin beats the blitz on third down, and Romo misses him!! Had him wide open down the right side, behind his man, and Romo threw it too far. Big mistake. He went for it all by leading him instead of just making sure they got the first down. A short punt by McBriar gives the Giants the ball at their 42. Coughlin tells his defense, “Go get that ball back for us.” Pierre-Paul hasn’t made a great play in about 90 minutes. Maybe he’s due. Cowboys start at the 20 after the touchback. The review confirms the call. Giants will kick here, and go down by 5. (Going for 2 does nothing for them.) It’s 34-29 with 3:14 left. Onside kick or send out the defense? Not confident the Giants can get a stop here. Manning hits Nicks to the 8, then goes to his comfort receiver, tight end Jake Ballard, at the goal line. Ballard makes the catch and lands on the line for the score. They’re reviewing, but it looked good. Or did it? Hmmmmm. But it may cost the Giants more. They were hoping to get a win that would tie them with Dallas at 7-6 but give them control of their own playoff destiny down the stretch. Now they’re staring at the real possibility that they will be two games back with three games to go, and unable to win the season series with Dallas — a killer in the postseason tie-breakers. The Giants close with Washington at home, the Jets (who are the official home team in that game), and Dallas at home. Dallas now faces a much easier path: at Tampa Bay, home to the Eagles, and then at the Giants. But unless the Giants win a game here pretty soon, their playoff prospects won’t be an issue in Week 17. Was about to say that Dez Bryant still has not had a catch tonight, but now he does — a 50-yard touchdown! He was just as open as Manningham was on the Giants’ last score. Corey Webster handed him off to Antrel Rolle, but Rolle had come up to cut off an underneath crossing route. The result? Bryant ran right by them both, and caught the ball and danced into the end zone. (Hey Dez, how about catching more than one ball before you strut big guy?) What a disaster for the Giants, who now trail, 34-22, with 5:41 remaining. Lee returns the interception to the Giants 49. Turns out Manning’s sidearm throw was deflected at the line of scrimmage by Victor Butler, and Lee caught the ball after it hit off the lineman who was blocking him. Tough to see what happened there, but Manning threw into a crowd, the ball got knocked around a bit and then caught — somehow — by linebacker Sean Lee. Not even sure he caught it as much as he picked it up off the back or side of someone else. Either way, the Giants lose a golden chance to go back in front. He curls in front of Newman and picks up 15 to the 22 with 8:24 left. Gutsy call there. A long pass knocked away at the goal line on third down, but Coughlin’s going for it … Sometimes he runs like the giant ball in the first Indiana Jones movie — just bashing ahead, knocking aside anything that dares get in front of him. Romo finds Miles Austin on the next play for a 6-yard score, and the Cowboys are in front, probably only temporarily given the way the game has gone, at 27-22. Austin beat Aaron Ross to the pylon as Romo rolled right, but that score is squarely on the rookie, Amukamara, who got burned deep a play earlier. @SamBorden Sam Borden Looked like about 55 yards in the air on that pass from Romo. Thought for a second it was going to hit that giant screen. Sick throw. Mon Dec 12 4:05:50  via Sam Borden Romo buys a little time in the pocket and heaves a ball downfield for Robinson, who lost Amukamara coming across the middle. That’s a 74-yard gain before he’s pushed out, but Dallas is set go back in front. Giants are moving again, but then isn’t everyone tonight? Manning through three quarters: 17 of 31, 257 yards, 1 TD, 0 INTs. Nicks has six catches for 130 yards. Dallas’s Felix Jones has filled in capably for Murray, with 102 yards on 13 carries. Jones also has four catches from Tony Romo, whose 14 of 20 for 135 yards and 2 scores. Al Michaels just said he has a broken ankle. Season’s over if it’s true. Every one of tonight’s touchdown drives covered at least 80 yards (that one was 85 yards on 9 plays). If either of these teams ends up in the playoffs, they’re going to have to be a little stingier. Completely blown coverage there allows Manning to lob a ball to a wide open Mario Manningham, who races 47 yards for what will almost certainly be his easiest touchdown of the season. That’s our sixth lead change, as the Giants go back in front, 22-20. But Victor Cruz picks up a personal foul at the end of the play. @SamBorden Sam Borden Travis Beckum’s injury is moving – first they announced wrist, then ribs, now a chest injury. Either way, he’s out. Mon Dec 12 3:34:48  via Sam Borden Dan Bailey, who has been Mr. Automatic this season (when his coach doesn’t ice him), hits from 49 yards to make it 20-15 with 7:42 left in the third quarter. Romo had Robinson on a quick move on third-and-3, but Antrel Rolle threw off the timing of the play by accident by stepping in front of Robinson while he covered another receiver. Good thing, too, since with Rolle up that could have been a big play. Bradshaw got the ball on the Giants’ first three plays of the half. A 7-yard catch, a 1-yard run and a second run for no gain. If they’d have let him punt, it probably would have gone backward. The Cowboys call their first timeout of the second half 81 seconds after it begins. If they run out later and need one, Garrett will never hear the end of it. @FO_MTanier Michael Tanier Maybe Garrett should call all 3 now so he doesn’t get any funny urges later. Mon Dec 12 3:20:01  via Michael Tanier NBC reports that Bradshaw will play in second half after sitting out the first for violating team rules. Tafoya said Coughlin’s one-word response to why he didn’t play was: “Principles.” The Giants left 8 points on the table in the red zone, twice settling for field goals when touchdowns were within reach. In a tight game, they may come to regret one or both. Then again, they’re moving the ball well, and Dallas seems to lose one player per drive, so maybe they just need to keep up. Total yards in the first half: Giants 206, Cowboys 204. Just saw a frightening ad for the show, which returns to NBC’s lineup this week, and it’s looks terrifying. According to The Times’s Brian Stelter, that is exactly the point. Those 40 yards to Robinson turned out to be big, as Dan Bailey comes out and makes a 49-yard field goal with seconds left in the half to give Dallas a 17-15 lead. That’s the fifth lead change of the half. Pretty sure it won’t be the last. Cowboys center Phil Costa has left the game with a concussion and will not return. That leaves Dallas with a rookie free agent, Kevin Kowalski, snapping to Romo. Something to watch. No problems there, as Romo pump faked and hit Robinson down the sideline for a 40-yard gain. Jacobs picks up a bruising 6 on second down, but Manning just missed Jake Ballard in the end zone on third down, so Tynes comes out and bangs a 26-yarder. The Giants go back in front, 15-14, with 1:03 left in the half. Jones takes a quick handoff and bursts up the middle, but Pierre-Paul runs him down and pops the ball out!! Deon Grant grabs it out of the air and returns it to the 14. Second tremendous play by Pierre-Paul tonight, and the Giants are in position to steal some points — and the lead — before the half. The Giants punt, but Dallas is penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct when their returned signals for a fair catch and then starts blocking. That’s a no-no. They’ll start inside their 5. Guessing Romo won’t be dropping back this time. Collinsworth says Giants offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride told him that “if we can run it, I’m not going to do anything else.” And he’s right; they’re pounding it with Jacobs, and so far it’s working. Two-minute warning now, and Giants have moved to the Dallas 43. Remember, they started at the 20, so this will inevitably end in another touchdown, right? Pierre-Paul’s rush to force Romo into a safety has been the defensive highlight so far. Lately, no one is stopping anyone. Here are the numbers for the last three drives: Cowboys: 8 plays, 80 yards in 4:18. Result: Touchdown. Giants: 10 plays, 80 yards in 5:04. Result: Touchdown. Cowboys: 11 plays, 80 yards in 6:19. Result: Touchdown. Anyone sensing a theme here? Like it might not be a bad idea to have the ball last? That’s back-to-back 80-yard drives for the Cowboys, who end it with Romo’s 9-yard touchdown pass to Laurent Robinson. Dallas goes back in front, 14-12. When you see Cris Collinsworth on TV, he looks like the kind of guy who irons his boxers and his socks. When you can only hear him, he sounds like a guy who spits dip into a cup between plays. DeMarco Murray is getting x-rays on his ankle. Cowboys cornerback Mike Jenkins left with what looked to be a painful shoulder injury. And Justin Tuck is off getting looked at, too. After a long drive moves the Giants to the 9, and a pass-interference penalty on third-and-7 gives them the ball at the 1, Brandon Jacobs walks into the end zone on first and goal for the go-ahead touchdown. Giants lead, 12-7, with 12:45 left in the first half. Hicks’s last catch was his fourth of the first quarter; he has 105 receiving yards already. And Jacobs had six carries for 40 earth-shaking yards in the quarter, which just ended. The Cowboys lead, but let’s call this showdown a draw so far. Felix Jones sprints 26 yards up the middle on his first carry after replacing Murray, and Romo rolls right on the next play from the 12. But he’s not going right; he stops, wheels and throws back across to tight end John Phillips, who follows a line of blockers straight to the pylon. Touchdown Cowboys! They lead, 7-5, with 2:49 left in the quarter. Well-designed play, and well executed. Running back DeMarco Murray, one of the Cowboys’ most dangerous players, had to be helped off the field after Dave Tollefson rolled over both his ankles at the end of his last carry.Didn’t look good.  No cheering from those of you who have Felix Jones in fantasy. It’s bad karma. Manning atones for the near-pick-6 with a 64-yard completion down the middle to a wide open Hakeem Nicks, but the drive stalls there and Lawrence Tynes comes on for a 23-yard chip shot. Missed opportunity. Michelle Tafoya reports that Bradshaw’s rules violation was curfew related. How can that be? Aren’t the clocks bigger in Texas, too? On second look, Romo wasn’t hit that hard. But he lost his balance and couldn’t recover, spinning and falling into the end zone. Either way, that’s a quick 2 points, and the Giants have the ball back. @judybattista Judy Battista I think Romo just safetied himself — is that possible? Mon Dec 12 1:42:32  via Judy Battista The punt pinned the Cowboys deep, and after a 1-yard run Romo dropped back on second down. But Jason Pierre-Paul just manhandled his blocker and threw Romo to the ground in the end zone. Though Romo scrambled to his feet and tried to sell it, that’s a sack — and a safety! Giants lead, 2-0. Eli Manning quickly wipes out all the good vibes of the Jacobs run by throwing a pick-6 to Terence Newman. The good news for Manning is that Newman dropped it. Everyone on the Giants sideline takes a deep breath and — probably for the best — they punt the ball away two plays later. That could have been a disaster. Who needs Ahmad Bradshaw when Brandon Jacobs is hurdling tacklers in the open field? Take a moment to consider his size — he’s built like a defensive end. So when he jumps over a defensive back, that’s like jumping the Snake River Canyon in an SUV. Jacobs may get a lot of grief, but that really shows what kind of an athlete he is. The Cowboys start with the ball but go nowhere. The early news is that Giants running back Ahmad Bradshaw did not start because of a violation of team rules. Not exactly the tone Tom Coughlin wanted to set. @SamBorden Sam Borden Maybe Bradshaw forgot his dark socks for the plane. Mon Dec 12 1:36:29  via Sam Borden
