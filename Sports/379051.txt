The N.F.L. is a $9 billion business.  Major League Baseballâs revenue stands at $7 billion. Yet the winnersâ shares for Super Bowl players are much smaller than for the World Series winners. A postseason share for each Super Bowl-winning Giant is $172,000 compared with the $323,169 that each St. Louis Cardinal took home last fall for beating the Texas Rangers in the World Series. Not that youâre hearing the Super Bowl M.V.P. Eli Manning whine that David Freese got almost twice as much for winning the World Series. But even in losing, 47 Rangers got a full share of $251,515, a chunk more than the Manning, Victor Cruz and the other Giants. Each share is the sum of money distributed in each playoff round. The N.F.L. and M.L.B. have different formulas that are the result of collective bargaining with the playersâ unions.  Part of the differences in the size of the shares is the number of games played.

A World Series winner can play 19 games over three rounds in ballparks with capacities from mid-30,000 to over 50,000. At most, a Super Bowl winner plays four games, though in much larger stadiums.  And football teams are larger and slice their playoff cash more ways. So with postseason pay, itâs better to play baseball. Last year, each Green Bay Packer received $161,000 for a playoff run that ended with a Super Bowl win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. But each World Series-winning San Francisco Giant got $317,631, while each losing Ranger got $246,279. The N.F.L. has a four-tiered formula that breaks out what players will get for winning or losing. The Super Bowl champions receive $88,000 each, this and next year. The pay-scale rises to $92,000 in 2013 and then, in the following years, to $97,000, $102,000, $107,000, $112,000, $118,000, $124,000 and $130,000 in 2020. The losing Super Bowl team gets half what the winners are paid. Such a gap does not exist in earlier rounds. Indeed, the payment system in the wild-card round is a bit wacky. If the wild-card team beats the division winner, each winning player gets less than those on the losing team. Last year, for instance, when the wild-card Jets beat the division-winning Indianapolis Colts, and the wild-card Ravens beat the division champion Kansas City Chiefs, each winning player was paid $19,000. The losers received $21,000 apiece. And no matter who wins or loses in the divisional playoffs or the conference title games, the payoff is the same. This year, the sums are $22,000 and $40,000, respectively; those figures that will increase to $33,000 and $59,000 in 2020. M.L.B. does not have a similar breakdown. Rather, the playersâ pool comes from 60 percent of the gate receipts from the first three games of the division series, Games 1 to 4 of the league championship series and the first four games of the World Series.
