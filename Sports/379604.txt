While it may seem like a relatively new phenomenon, trick shots were invented and perfected by the Harlem Globetrotters over the last 85 years. But in a world where groups like Dude Perfect are posting unbelievable videos to YouTube, and UConnâs backup quarterback Johnny McEntee is throwing footballs through basketball hoops while sitting in the stands, it raises the question of how the Globetrotters will be able to compete. To borrow a phrase from Bill OâReillyâs viral video, theyâll âdo it live.â On Tuesday, Globetrotters teammates Nate Lofton, known as Big Easy, and Anthony Blakes, known as Buckets, will board Circle Line boats in the Hudson River while two basketball hoops will be loaded into a separate boat. Then as the ships pass in the water, Lofton and Blakes will attempt to hit shots from at least 35 feet, the distance of the teamâs new 4-point shot, gradually trying shots from even farther away once they succeed.

Lofton and Blakes are obvious choices for the event, with Lofton having hit an 80-foot hook shot last year and Blakes having previously shared the record for underhanded halfcourt shots in less than a minute with Jason Kidd until their record of two was surpassed by Arve Gravdal of Norway, who hit three. Lofton also gained some notoriety having appeared on the television show âThe Amazing Raceâ, which he will appear on again this season. As with all things Globetrotters-related, the team is getting the community involved, asking children from P.S. 111 to join the players on the boats after the shooting demonstration to discuss character. The team will be in the area playing six games from Feb. 18 to 21, with two games at Madison Square Garden.
