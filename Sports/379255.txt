Great players donât forget how to do great things. When a defining moment comes, and a golfer like Tom Watson has an opportunity to win a major championship as he did on Sunday itâs just a matter of whether the body will do what the old head tells it to do. Watson didnât look back at the 5-foot birdie putt he had missed at the 18th hole during the Senior P.G.A. Championship at Valhalla Golf Club moments earlier in regulation play. He stared at the 4-footer he had in front of him at the first playoff hole to win. And he wasted no time making it. One practice stroke and, bam, right in the back of the cup, just like all the putts of that length that he made for so many years on the regular tour. Watson, who will be 62 in September, looked more like the 32-year-old who slammed the door on Jack Nicklaus at the 1982 United States Open at Pebble Beach, denying Nicklaus a record fifth Open. The first thing he asked before answering questions afterward? âWho is the oldest?â he asked after learning that he became the second-oldest winner of the Senior P.G.A. Championship. Told it was Jock Hutchison, who was 62 when he won it in 1947, Watson said: âWow. OK.â He was calculating, making a mental note, no doubt, about next year, when he might try to win his third Senior P.G.A. Championship. There isnât any doubt that Watson keeps count. He might have been doing too much of that two years ago at the British Open at Turnberry in Scotland, where he came within a par at the last hole of becoming the oldest man, at 59, to win one of golfâs four majors.
 That would have been unreal â to have smashed the age barrier. He would have been 11 years older than Julius Boros, who was 48 when he won the 1968 P.G.A. Championship. It was not to be, but Watsonâs feat Sunday wasnât bad. It would be nice if the two Senior P.G.A. Championship wins could equal one regular P.G.A. Championship because it would fill the one hole on his rÃ©sumÃ©. He never won the career Grand Slam, and â like Arnold Palmer â the P.G.A. Championship was the one that eluded him. But Watson is a realist who does not live in the world of âwhat if?â He won 39 tournaments on the PGA Tour, and he won eight major championships, some, like the 1982 Open, at Nicklausâs expense. When asked five years ago by Guy Yocom of Golf Digest if he had Nicklausâs number, Watson demonstrated just how carefully he keeps score. âI did get the better of Jack at the British Open in 1977, at the U.S. Open in 1982 and the Masters in 1981,â he said. âBut he finished first in majors 18 times, and in the top three 46 times. So did I have his number? The short answer â and it canât be any shorter â is no.â But he was a worthy competitor, one of the toughest Nicklaus ever had, which makes his victory Sunday  at 61, the week of Nicklausâs Memorial Tournament, all the more significant. Watson won the Memorial Tournament in 1996, his penultimate PGA Tour victory, at the age of 46. Watson is feeling the aches and pains now, he said, more than ever. He can still make putts under pressure, after overcoming a bad case of the yips that dogged him in the late 1980s and â90s on the tour. But just as he remembered how to do it when he had to, he also knows his competitive time is growing short. âAs I said out there, if this is the last tournament I ever win, itâs not a bad one to win,â Watson said.
Not bad at all.
