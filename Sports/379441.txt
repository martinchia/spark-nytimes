Advertisement  Aaron Pryor will have an eye examination by a New York Athletic Commission doctor today to determine if can resume fighting in the state. Dr. Vincent Giovinazzi will check the progress of Pryor's recovery from January 1989, when the former junior welterweight champion had surgery to remove cataracts and repair a detached retina in his left eye. After the surgery, Pryor was suspended from fighting in New York, Nevada, New Jersey and California.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
