Advertisement  JULIO FRANCO became the second of the Texas Rangers' big hitters of 1993 to move to a new team this week. Following RAFAEL PALMEIRO's free-agent footsteps, which took him to Baltimore, Franco agreed yesterday to a one-year contract with the Chicago White Sox. Franco, whose shaky right knee made him strictly a designated hitter this past season, will have a guaranteed $1 million salary, but he can earn an additional $1 million if he goes to the plate 600 times. He had 607 plate appearances this year, batting .289 and driving in 84 runs. The 32-year-old former second baseman also has a bonus provision based on number of games he plays defensively. He could earn as much as $500,000 if he has a fielding glove on his hand in 140 games. Franco's career average of .300 (actually .2999) is seventh highest among active players. His career high of .341 in 1991 with Texas led the American League in hitting. The White Sox agreed not to offer Franco salary arbitration after next season so that he can be a free agent again.
