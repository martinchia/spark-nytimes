Advertisement  Arnold Palmer, who had last won a golf tournament in 1985 at the Seniors Tournament Championship, ended his three-year drought last weekend at the PGA Seniors Tour tournament at Richmond. ''The king is back,'' said Larry Mowry, the defender who finished four strokes behind Palmer. ''Long live the king.'' Palmer said: ''When you haven't won in a couple of years, a lot of things go through your mind. You wonder why you haven't won, if you're ever going to win again. I wanted to win very badly and I felt if I didn't make any bad mistakes, I could.''(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
