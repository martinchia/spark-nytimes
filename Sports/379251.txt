It’s the dream of nearly every little kid: to have a famous person come to their birthday party. Matt Cannon, a 10-year-old hockey player who lives in Tonawanda, N.Y., has done one better. He invited Chicago Blackhawks star Patrick Kane to his birthday party last June. And Kane showed up. And here’s the bonus part: the two have now become friends.  Kane hails from Buffalo, a favored hockey son of all western New York. Cannon recently did a very nice thing for his friend, knowing that Kane has never received the puck from his Stanley Cup-winning goal in 2010. When Kane scored in overtime of Game 6, defeating the Flyers 4-3, the puck disappeared in the crazy melee of joy. He’s continued to search to get it back for his memorabilia collection. Cannon just had his own experience with winning a title. He scored the game-winning goal for his squirt hockey team, helping it win the Western New York Hockey League title in March. He decided to send the puck to Kane, because he wanted his friend to be happy.

 “Matt wanted Patrick to have this puck because he knows Patrick’s winning puck is still missing,” Cannon’s father, Dave, told the Chicago Tribune. “He told me, ‘Patrick has given me so much, so I want to give him the only thing I can that he doesn’t have.’ ” Kane was very touched. He understood the significance of the gesture, especially coming from a 10-year-old boy. He wanted Cannon to have the important puck for his collection, so he autographed it, “Congratulations on your goal, you should be proud – Patrick Kane 88,” and sent it back to Cannon. “He gave me his game-winning-goal puck just because I didn’t have mine,” Kane told the Chicago Tribune. “He mailed the puck to my parents’ place. It was pretty cool. (But) it would obviously be nice to have the real thing back.” Dave is amazed by how everything has turned out, given his son made a far-fetched invite to his birthday party. It seemed logical to Cannon to send an invite to Kane, given the party was being held at a floor hockey facility.  “Every year we have a party, and about mid-May we say to Matt, ‘Who’s going to be on your invitation list?'” Dave said. “Last year, he said he wanted to invite Patrick Kane. So he filled out the invitation, and we sent it. We never thought anything of it â why would you? Imagine our surprise when Patrick Kane walked onto the court.” Kane proved to be a lovely party guest, bringing autographed items for the kids. And he played some floor hockey with the fathers and sons.  “I thought it would be cool to show up for 10 or 15 minutes, and I ended up staying there for a little bit,” Kane said. “The kids are the most important fans. They’re the future fans, and maybe one day they’ll be playing with us too.” Slap Shot, the New York Times hockey blog, reports on the Rangers, the National Hockey League and anything that glides quickly across a frozen surface anywhere on the globe, from the snowy prairies of Saskatchewan to the frigid steppes of Russia and beyond, like, say, Phoenix.
