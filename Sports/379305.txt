At 31, Lucas Boyce is one of the N.B.A.âs youngest executives. His role as the Orlando
Magicâs director of multicultural insights, cause marketing and government affairs comes after he served in the White House during George W. Bushâs administration. Boyce arrived to the positions despite meager beginnings. He was born prematurely to a woman who worked as a prostitute and who abused drugs and alcohol, which stunted his development. He was raised in a foster home. After graduating high school, Boyce listed three goals: working for the White House, flying on Air Force One and working for an N.B.A. team. Boyce has accomplished all three and this month he debuted a book: âLiving Proof: From Foster Care to the White House and the N.B.A.,â which details his story and ascent. He recently answered questions about his book. What is the bookâs goal?  Hopefully, itâs a book that empowers young people, especially people from disadvantaged backgrounds. The book is called âLiving Proof.â There are a lot of people who use examples from others. I want to use myself as an example, in that you can accomplish anything that you strive for. The book is about growing up in a bi-cultural home and touches on issues of race, and trans-racial adoption. My mom, Dorothy Boyce, instilled in me two keys to success. You can do anything if you put your mind to it and if youâre willing to work harder and
longer than everybody and if you remember who you are and what you represent, you can be successful because of your integrity.
 What were your roles in the White House and how did that come about? After 9/11, I wanted to be involved. I thought it was as good a time as any. I was an intern there and I thought, literally, I was checking the box and that was the dream. Then, six months after 9/11, I was taking part in a photo opportunity. President Bush was there and we were just rapping. After we finished the photo opportunity, he said letâs do a personal photo op. The next day, my boss said that President Bush had called him and asked about me and how I could become more involved. You never know whoâs watching and whoâs going to be able to help you achieve your dreams. I worked in the Office of Public Liaison and directed African-American and Professional Sports Outreach, the Vice Presidentâs Political and Communications Office and did public relations and education outreach for diverse communities and issues on behalf of the President. How did you transition into the N.B.A.? When I was about 12 years old, the first basketball game I ever saw was the 1991 finals when Jordan made that incredible shot over the Lakers. That was literally the first game I ever saw and the first time I saw Michael Jordan. I knew I wanted to be involved with it one day. Once I got to the White House, I knew that was one of my goals, but I wasnât sure of how to get there and kind of put it on the back burner. One day, White House communications director Kevin Sullivan caught up with me and we had a conversation about what we would do when the current administration ended and I told him my goal. Kevin surprised me when he said that he used to be in charge of communications for the Dallas Mavericks. A few months later, unbeknownst to me, Kevin made sure to have me conduct a tour of the West Wing that he knew Joel Glass, an Orlando executive, would be on. We hit it off and later, I sent in a resume, but they didnât have anything available at the time. A few months later, though, the Magic
created a new department aimed at bringing the organization closer to a growing and diversifying community. Thatâs what started the whole process. What does your current position with the Magic entail? I travel all around central Florida, sharing the story with students. I look like them and share with them the same type of background and they may have this dream. Maybe you might not be a basketball player, but you can work for an organization like this and itâs practical. Hereâs living proof that you can achieve some neat things at an early age. I try to make a difference in somebodyâs life. Whether thatâs giving out tickets or helping create funds for computers. How did the book project come about? I actually didnât originally have the goal to write a book. I talked to the Magicâs senior vice president Pat Williams and he asked what my story was. Heâs the one who said, âMan, you should write a book.â For the last two years, this has been my goal: to have a book come out that can hopefully be an encouragement to people.
