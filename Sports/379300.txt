The Associated Press: COLUMBUS, Ohio  â Former Ohio State quarterback Art Schlichter, whose NFL career was derailed by a gambling addiction, was charged Monday with stealing more than $1 million from a 68-year-old woman in suburban Columbus. Schlichter has offered to cooperate with an ongoing police investigation into the sale of Ohio State football tickets and 2011 Super Bowl tickets. Schlichter has been arrested so many times —  serving in dozens of prisons  — that itÂ Â  almost ceases to be  news.  Still, this was no ordinary episode. The 68-year-old woman who said she was swindled is the widow of the former Wendy’s chairman Robert Barney, and she said she considered suicide after trying to help  Schlichter.  Mike Wagner, The Columbus Dispatch: Anita Barney pulled her car next to her husband’s grave, clicked off the safety on a handgun and was moments from pulling the trigger when her cell phone rang. It was her son, who called by chance, realized what was happening and begged his mom not to take her own life. “That guy is not worth killing yourself over, Mom,” he said. Since encountering former Ohio State quarterback Art Schlichter about 17 months ago, Anita Barney’s life has been nearly destroyed, and not just in that moment at the cemetery. In 2009, Schlichter   completed a book about his life, “Busted,” and had convinced many that he had kicked his gambling addiction. He was speaking out on the  dangers of gambling and  managing gamblingpreventionawareness.org. But he was realistic about the challenge he faced, writing in his book: âI had, and still have, an addiction. Itâs a severe, severe addiction. Itâs kind of like crack cocaine in that it takes away your soul and your character.â  âSome people say to me today, âDonât worry, itâs all behind you.â â âNo, it isnât, because you canât just walk away from a disease like mine. âWill I do bad things again that will send me back to prison? I admit the urge is always there. âToday, I know Iâm still only one wrong step away from imprisonment, insanity, or death.â The Fifth Down ran the first chapter of his book on Sept. 1, 2009.
