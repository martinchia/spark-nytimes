				}); Could one reporter cover six professional New York sporting events within a period of 24 hours and not lose his mind? The answer: sort of. Mike Tanier rented out the Bats blog on Saturday and documented his experience. After covering Friday night’s Red Bulls game, Tanier attended five more area events today: the New York Mini 10K, the Yankees-Indians game, the Adidas Grand Prix, the Belmont Stakes and the Liberty-Fever game. He did make it to all six events. Whether or not his mind is still intact has yet to be determined.  Recap Tanier’s entire journey here and on Twitter (@FO_MTanier) using the hashtag #6sports. 


9:54 P.M.This 24 Hour Experiment Is Over


At about 5:00 p.m., photographer Todd Heisler and I were still climbing the R.F.K. bridge span over the East Kills on foot, wind buffeting us, traffic rumbling below, path beneath us perceptibly swaying. The Manhattan skyline was shrouded in fog, so there were no vistas to admire. I looked down onto the fields below. Teenagers played soccer a few hundred feet below me. A Little League field, temporarily vacant, sat at the ready. When going from sport to sport, you must pass over a few other sports in between.
This 24 hour experiment reminded me that the sports experience is best when the line between participant and fan is not razor sharp, and when the walls that separate them are thin and permeable. Major League Soccer thrives on young fans who slap high-five to players before the game and feel a familial kinship with the teams, players, and sport itself. The Mini Marathon 10K places amateurs on the same track with Olympians, bringing them all together in Central Park and giving medals to many, not just champions. Junior track stars compete just before Olympians at the Adidas Grand Prix, with the same crowd urging them on and participants sometimes finding their way into the stands. The Belmont is part picnic, part horse race, and your attention does not have to be centered on your betting slip to have a good time.
Todd Heisler/The New York TimesLiberty fans celebrated at the Prudential Center in Newark on Saturday night.
The W.N.B.A. is not the most popular of leagues, but sit in an arena full of teenage girls chanting and screaming for something other than some teen idol singer, and you can feel the sportâs allure and understand its potential importance.
And then there is Yankee Stadium, where every effort is made to keep players and fans as far away as possible, where every rule seems designed to make everything more expensive and impersonal. We love baseball, but it doesnât always put a great effort into loving us back. None of the âbigâ sports do anymore. Yankee fans still come together â I had great conversations with fans at Yankee Stadium, especially in the hot sausage line, which never moved â but the team and sport is at armâs length. We do not even think of how far away from the players we are anymore until we go to a smaller event and stand next to them, or even compete with them.
It was funny how people I spoke to or who commented on the blogs insisted that of the six sports on my itinerary, only one or two were worth covering. Soccer fans turned their noses up at baseball. Baseball fans shrugged at track and field. No one really stood up for the W.N.B.A., perhaps because tweenage girls do not read sports blogs. One fanâs main event is another fanâs non-event. Who needs Olympians when you have game 62 of an 162 game schedule? Who cares about horse racing, except for hundreds of thousands of fans nationwide? Every sport has itâs fanatics, who see a level of beauty and detail others cannot appreciate, as well as casual fans, who attend the games to soak up atmosphere or follow the biggest storylines. Preferring one sport to another does not make anyone smarter, or more open-minded, or more macho, though we often couch our preferences that way. They are just preferences, and the sports that inspire them have merits independent of our tastes, as acts of human achievement, will, agility, endurance, grace, or strength. The sports do not need all of us to like all of them. They just need to be.
This journey opened my eyes to sports I never noticed, made me sit among fans I was never sure existed. It was grueling, frustrating at times, and damp, but absolutely unforgettable. Any one of these events would be worth the effort. Or two, or three. Or all six, if someone would invent a transporter beam that shortens the trip from Queens to Jersey.

I am hungry. I am not sure where I am parked. But I now know who Grete Waitz was and know why the New York Red Bulls are a playoff-caliber soccer team, what womenâs steeplechase looks like and who spends Saturday night watching W.N.B.A. College baseball is on television at the bar. Vanderbilt-Oregon State. I think I will watch a little.  After a trip like this, whatâs a little more sports? Final: fever 86 Liberty 80 #6sportsSun Jun 12 01:11:36  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier  In a way, we are all livin on a prayer #6sportsSun Jun 12 01:08:22  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier  Bon jovi is cruel punishment right now #6sports.Sun Jun 12 01:07:09  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier  They said it could not be done. It probably should not be done. But we did it. I am behind the New York Liberty basket. They are winning by two. They just scored on a break to make it four. This is the final event of my Six Sports in 24 Hours Odyssey. I do not know what is going on. I know that the crowd, though sparse, is rocking, and there are dancers in rainbow wigs at center court. Or maybe that is a hallucination. Getting from Belmont Park on the fringe of Queens to Newark is not easy. Our cab driver, a Long Island native, told us that we âhad to go northwest to go southeast,â and other Zen insights. We reached Prudential Arena to find the ticket box office closed and security disinterested in tales of sports road trips gone mad. Luckily, a patron had two extra tickets, and I had a few extra bucks. There was a near brawl when we left Belmont Park. Police broke up two drunks about to spar, and one of the drunks walked behind us for the rest of our trip out of the track and in search of a cab. âHeâs an old guy. They get bored,â his girlfriend said, trying to calm him. âBored? Well I just wanted to make his day,â he replied before telling her about all the nearby women he found attractive. Neither will remember this tomorrow, but I will. By contrast, Liberty games are family events (there were plenty of families out in the picnic area of the Belmont, but even there things were getting wild). The young girls in front of me have thundersticks. They âwoofâ to âWho Let the Dogs Out.â I am past the 24 hour mark on this journey, and I have a headache, but the cheers and cries of âdefenseâ still sound heavenly. Liberty up by three. Time to post. Six events. Twenty-four hours. Almost Done! 8:25 left to play liberty winning. I am here. I made it! #6sportsSun Jun 12 00:48:09  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier  Passing Citi Field.

It…it…had its own ecosystem #6sportsSat Jun 11 22:28:09  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier  I am the last sober American at the worldâs largest picnic. I am blogging from a park bench beside a beer vendor at Belmont Park. The fellow next to me is eating peanuts as if it is his lifeâs vocation, throwing shells to the ground with grim determination. I smell beer, cigar smoke, beer, the distant horses trotting on a nearby display track, stale sportswriter, and beer.  Most patrons are dressed for the weather, but many girls are wearing a New York version of the elaborate Kentucky Derby hat. Or at least they are channeling their inner Pippa. Many are staggering under the weight of their hats, or for some other reason. Walking across the R.F.K. bridge was a once-in-a-lifetime act. I plan to make certain of that. It is deceptively long, and it sways. A livery cab took us on the Grand Central Expressway to the track; gaper delay from a serious westbound accident slowed our progress. I am blogging under the gun to get this to you before race time. Here are my pre-written notes on the race: Coming on the tail end of horse racingâs Triple Crown, the Belmont Stakes is like the fourth quarter of a football game, only the rest of the game took place two weeks ago. The Belmont is a gambler who bets everything on the Triple Crown winner at the Preakness, then watches the final furlong with crossed fingers, waiting for Shackleford to fade as expected, realizing he wonât, and accepting that fan interest and television ratings will once again be down this year. With no Triple Crown at stake, the consolation prize is a rubber match between Derby winner Animal Kingdom and Preakness upstart Shackleford. This time itâs personal. Or equine, at least. The Triple Crown is not a âBest of Threeâ series, thank heavens, but Animal Kingdom versus Shackleford provides a hook for non-horse racing fans, as well as a neat pneumonic for those of us who rarely cover this sport. Whenever I am at risk of forgetting the names of the top contenders, I picture Marlon Perkins in a footrace against a terrible 76ers forward from the late 1980s. Perkins always wins, then tries to sell me flood insurance. There are other horses in the field. Thereâs Nehro, who finished second in the Derby but took the Preakness off to rest, the slacker. Thereâs Brilliant Speed, whom T.O. Whenham of Docâs Sports Service says âisnât particularly a fast horse, but rather one with a lot of staying power.â I can relate to a horse like that, and staying power is a must on a race track which circles the equator. Brilliant Speedâs great uncle Touch The Gold won the Belmont in 1997, though I am told that the two never speak to each other anymore. With their flowing manes and complicated bloodlines, racehorses remind me a little of the Matthews family in the N.F.L. I knew little about the Belmont heading into the race, except that it is run on sand and is longer than the other two Triple Crown races. My horse racing experience extends only to a few Bloody Mary fueled afternoons at Philadelphia Park and a typical flirtation with death at the Preakness which may have been a hallucination. I know the Belmont has an official cocktail, just like the other races. The Kentucky Derby has the mint julep (bourbon, syrup, mint sprig, dash of antebellum despair) and the Preakness has the black eyed Susan (wheelbarrow full of canned light beer, consumed through a funnel). The Belmont Breeze mixes bourbon, sherry, lemon juice, syrup, cranberry juice, orange juice, mint leaves, orange zest, bacon bits, lawn clippings, Enfamil, and dishwasher soap and serves it an old jelly jar. Really, itâs the spilled remains of a mint julep and a black eyed Susan, plus anything that was lying on the bar at the end of the shift. I cannot wait to try one. If animal kingdom wins at 5-2, I can afford to get home. #6sportsSat Jun 11 22:31:32  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier   The Times authorized me to place one $5 bet, which is further evidence that this assignment is just an elaborate effort to humiliate me. Not only must I look like a harried lunatic, but a penny-ante player as well. To make matters worse, many friends asked me to place bets for them, as if my schedule is not tight enough. A friend from Baltimore asked me to bet on Animal Kingdom. He was at the Preakness, and therefore has no idea how it turned out. (I get paid by the drunken Preakness joke). The worst thing I discovered while researching the Belmont Stakes is that an effort to update the music selections by adding âEmpire State of Mindâ to the mix failed because race fans found the selection too edgy. Does this surprise anyone? Racetracks, like bowling alleys, are time capsules. Head to the track as a 22-year old in a Yankees cap, and you walk out with a fedora, a cigar, kidney stones, and a pocketful of torn betting slips. I love Jay-Z, but I donât want to hear him at the track, or the church picnic. Songs like âNew York, New York,â bring entire communities together, because we can all agree that it is a lame selection. I am all for anything that helps build a consensus. It is time for me to seek that bet and that drink. Follow the Twitter feed for more observations. Photographer Todd Heisler and I will be under the gun to get to the New York Liberty game after the race. Unless I win big, in which case you may never hear from me again.  Traffic on grand central parkway. Will not be defeated! #6sportsSat Jun 11 21:32:23  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier  This pedestrian walkway is a hamster trail. I am just lookin for pellets and a wheel #6sportsSat Jun 11 20:45:44  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier  I am humming the Barney Miller theme for some reason. #6sportsSat Jun 11 20:53:52  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier  4 events down, 2 to go. Show me the horsies! #6sportsSat Jun 11 20:29:19  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier  Best thing about a track meet: it is not 1 event, but dozens of events #6sportsSat Jun 11 20:16:52  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier  You are one of the worldâs greatest athletes. But how fast are you when your feet are soaked? The womenâs 3,000 meter steeplechase answers that question, one you may have never thought to ask. Women run three kilometers, leap intermittent hurdles, and deal with one water hazard. They clear the hurdle, then plop soundly into the water, sometimes with both feet, splashing everyone around them. You probably donât like walking with soggy feet. These women run a few thousand meters and leap a few more hurdles. I expected the menâs 400 meter run to be dramatic, and it was, with Jeremy Warner edging two competitors in the final seconds. The 400 meter hurdles were also compelling, with Bershawn Jackson losing steam after the last hurdle and finishing second to Javier Culson, who lunged and rolled to the ground as he broke the tape. The steeplechase caught me off guard: long, odd, wet, and fascinating, with an amazing finish: Milcah Chemos of Kenya and Sofia Assefa of Ethiopia ran side-by-side for the final 100 meters or so, with Chemos finishing :08 seconds ahead. The crowd at Icahn Stadium is indifferent to the weather. Most seats are under a long awning, but even spectators exposed to the elements are riveted. I see this all the time in football, of course: frozen diehards shivering through fourth quarters in December. Every sport has its diehards, even sports some of us overlook when focusing on baseball and football. Idowu is so much more conservative these days. Can’t argue with a 16.61m first jump. #6sportsSat Jun 11 19:33:07  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier  The Adidas Prix continues. I will soon be crossing the R.F.K. Bridge, on foot, in the rain, to go to Belmont Park. For now, there are more races, more jumps. The athletes stretch and jog on a nearby field. Traffic zooms on the bridge overpasses overhead. More Olympians await. A rainy afternoon in the company of exemplary athletes is better than a sunny day nearly anyplace else. In news from past events on my adventure, I just learned Bartolo Colon came up limping after covering first. He is a great pitcher. But he should not attempt the steeplechase. Water jump is soooo redundant this afternoonSat Jun 11 19:25:20  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier  Workers trying to mop up puddles when steeplechasers are on far side of track #6sportsSat Jun 11 19:23:04  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier  Pistorius at 45:69, does not get automatic championship qualification #6sportsSat Jun 11 19:16:29  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier  Randalls Island is Manhattanâs playground, a tranquil paradise in the shadow of Interstate overpasses. Today, it is dreary, soggy, and cold, though not as cold as Yankee Stadium, where you could hang meat by the third inning. In another concession to electronic safety, I am in the press tent, though I will soon leave to cover the major events of the Adidas Grand Prix. Leaving Yankee Stadium during a scoreless tie in the third inning felt unnatural, and I did not even get my darn cap, but duty calls. Photographer Todd Heisler and I took the No. 4 train to 125th Street, where the Puerto Rican festival was in full swing. We took one look at the overcrowded bus, and hailed a cab. A javelin thrower leaving Icahn Stadium hailed the cab as we arrived. If you see a cab with a javelin bag sticking out both windows, wave to her. The big event, coming dangerously soon, is the menâs 400 meter dash. âBlade Runnerâ Oscar Pistorius needs a time of 45:25 in the 400 qualify for the World Championships in September. Pistorius’s goal today is to push harder on the first 200 meters than he has in past races. Pistorius was born without fibula bones and had his lower legs amputated before he was a year old. He runs using âCheetahâ prosthetic blades.  Judging from a recent interview with The Guardian, being a double-amputee track star is one of the least interesting things about being Pistorius. He owns two white tigers, as well as a racehorse; perhaps he can share a cab with me over to Belmont Park. He loves to cook, telling the Guardian that he would make âhomemade bread with jalapenos, then we’d have a lasagne and then molten pudding with chocolate truffles for dessert,â if hosting a meal. He once sang âLaylaâ in a karoke bar, though he could not place the name of the song. (âIt was the one that goes âYou got me on my knees, baby. Doo doo do doo.ââ) Covering athletes of this caliber, particularly ones who overcame severe limitations to achieve greatness, makes me feel like an all-time slacker. Itâs encouraging to know that I could lick globe-trotting, tiger-taming sprinters in a Derek And the Dominoes sound-alike competition, if nothing else. The white tigers make me wonder: who takes care of them when Pistorius is traveling? Kennels are probably out of the question. Does a neighbor stop by and toss them some meat, plus some molten pudding? If they travel with him, I hope they are not allowed in press tents. Sprinter Tyson Gay is the biggest star on the bill today, but his 100m dash is scheduled for 4:50, and the Belmont Stakes post time is 6:40. Whatâs insane about my itinerary is that the longer the day gets, the closer together events are scheduled, the further away from each other they are, and the shorter they are. It forces me to make difficult journalistic choices: miss Animal Kingdom versus Shackleford to catch a few seconds of Tyson Gay? That is not a good trade unless Usain Bolt shows up unannounced to challenge Gay.  Instead, I will settle for Olympic bronze medal-winning hurdler Bershawn Jackson, who earned the nickname âBatmanâ because childhood friends thought he had big ears. Does Batman have big ears? Does Bruce Wayne tuck them into his cowl? It never comes up in the comics or movies.  Thereâs also triple jumper Christian Olsson of Sweden, who has won not just Olympic gold but two Waterford Crystal European Athlete of the Year Trophies, which are probably very fragile. Olsson is also rather fragile, having missed several meet seasons with foot injuries, and today he battles Phillips Idowu, an English silver medalist with Dennis Rodmanâs fashion sense. Many fitness magazines have published detailed accounts of Idowuâs triple jump technique and triple-jump specific workouts. The sport is incredibly stressful on the body (triple jumpers absorb a force greater than 10 times their body weight when landing before their final jump) but the skills involved donât translate into everyday life. When was the last time you had a water cooler conversation with someone training explicitly to improve his or her triple jump length?  When not describing workouts, Idowu talks about his pet: an Akida with a pink leash. âSheâs got her little diamante collar and lead — that was her one year birthday present. Sheâs definitely spoilt,â Idowu told AskMen.com. Sheâs a good guard dog and sheâs very wary of people she doesnât know coming round to the house which makes me feel more comfortable when I go away.â Idowu should talk to Pistorius: those white tigers provide home security and would probably look fetching with a diamante collar. Off to the stands. I think the rain is letting up. I hope the rain is letting up. Please, oh rain, please let upâ¦ The starter gun is much louder in person #6sportsSat Jun 11 19:07:51  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier   I got 2 scoreless innings in. 3 events down, 3 to go!!! #6sportsless than a minute ago via MOTOBLUR  Favorite  Retweet  ReplyMichael TanierFO_MTanier    Phelps medium fly 8.

There are bag-checks nearby (reputable ones, not Uncle Vinnyâs Stop ânâ Steal Checkorama), but they do not offer laptop charging services. This is a niche market that someone with ambition, a long extension cord, and a lot of splitters should fill. Yankee Stadium security guards are incredibly polite and professional. They shepherded me through a tangle of gates and help booths, and one took maternal pity on me as I filed my last post cross-legged outside of Gate Two. She stopped just short of offering me a saucerful of milk. The weather remains overcast and cool, but the rain appears to be holding off. I will not be here long, but Derek Jeter leads off the bottom of the first, and I must see him pursue history before I head to Randallâs Island. Now it is time to leave the press box, after I use the facilities, have a soda â¦ wait, is that Caesar salad? No, no, I am here as a fan, I took the D train with fans, and I have a ticket. The laptop stays here. I need a ballpark hotdog, an hour on the heels of my previous meal. Letâs play ball! Or at least an inning of ball. And I want my cap. Yankee Stadium is a truly American destination, a plot of real estate so monumental and mythological, so steeped in cultural importance and vital to our national self-perception, that there is no way in heck that you can afford to go there. The price of four tickets, four pretzels, four sodas and two childrenâs souvenirs is one kidney. Season ticket plans come with 20 and 30-year adjustable rates. Yankees fans tell me it is cheaper to purchase tickets, hotel rooms, and train fare to road games against the Orioles than to watch the team at Yankees Stadium. Soon, it will be cheaper to build a time machine and travel back to see Urban Shocker pitch. More convenient, too. My editors, channeling Ricky Gervais while stifling their perverse snickers, denied me press credentials for this trip, suggesting that I simply buy tickets from a scalper if the game was sold out. I pictured myself asking the scalper for a reimbursement receipt, thought the better of their plan, and went straight to the Yankees website to get a ticket minutes after receiving my assignment. The interactive map showed that all of the affordable seats were gone, though I could sit behind home plate if I were willing to line up a co-signer. After surveying ticket prices and doing a few classic Danny Thomas spit-takes at the prices, I decided that Section 205, Seat 19, Row 1 was close enough to the action to tell Derek Jeter from, say, a statue of Joe Gordon, and wouldnât leave my family on an all-ramen diet until the reimbursements arrive. Even a simple online purchase is fraught with peril when performed Yankees style. I selected my seat, and a clock appeared telling me I had just a few minutes to enter my personal and credit card information. Suddenly, I was Jack Bauer, racing the clock to enter the 16-digit number that disarms the warheads and rescues his daughter from terrorists. Complete one section of the form, and the clock resets with additional time. I feared I would have to leap across mushrooms, dodge rotating swords, and defeat Bowser to complete my purchase. It is the kind of rigmarole I expect when buying Rolling Stones tickets, knowing they will sell out six seconds after they go on sale. (The tickets, that is; the Stones sold out in 1985). I actually wiped my brow in relief when the confirmation email told me I would not have to negotiate with petty criminals to sustain my journalistic career. Never have I felt more of a sense of accomplishment after paying $66.45 for an event I have only cursory interest in and no chance of seeing to its conclusion.  From the outside, Yankee Stadium is monolithic, imposing, and impersonal. It lacks the lived-in charm of Camden Yards, the dilapidated Norma Desmond grandeur of Fenway, the warehouse-with-streamers blue collar exuberance of Citizenâs Bank Park. On the other hand, itâs in no danger of being turned into a Cracker Barrel restaurant, like the Metsâ Citi Field. Itâs a close-fisted death punch of a building that doesnât so much blend with the surrounding architecture as pummel it into submission. It looks like a vault constructed for a power-mad Roman Emperor, designed to project might and omnipotence, not a pleasant spring afternoon with the kids. These are the Yankees, of course, so all of these metaphors are appropriate. It may be shocking to read this from a âNew Yorkâ journalist, but I have not set foot in Yankee Stadium in 20 years. The last time I was here, I was a college guy on a road trip, and New Jersey State Troopers stopped my friend and I on I-95 after the game simply because we were young dudes with Pennsylvania license plates (and also possibly because we were doing 85 miles per hour).  âWhere were you guys,â one officer asked, shining his flashlight in my eyes.  âYankee Stadium, sir,â I responded, squinting. âOh really?â he asked, a hint of playful doubt in his eyes. âWho won?â Suddenly, I was in a World War II movie. Who won the 1938 World Series? Nien! Nien! Ich weib nicht! But I did know.  âYankees won, 6-5. Kelly won it with a single in the ninth. Mattingly had two hits.â The officer believed us and let us go with a warning, perhaps fearing (rightfully) that I was the kind of person who offered unwanted pitch-by-pitch recounts of sporting events. A lot has changed since the grand Stump Merrill era, but one thing hasnât: Yankees Stadium is still a road trip Mecca, one that beckons sports fans from around the world to come and breathe the air once breathed by Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe Dimaggio, Mickey Mantle, Jim Leyritz, and now Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez. I must now find somewhere to check this laptop. A pizza delivery guy named Mookie said he can store it at Salâs pizza behind his buddyâs boom box. I have no worries that this will work out.

Few women were smiling, and none were looking at their watches. Most were grimacing, puffing, and panting. A few ran the last 50 meters with their arms raised in triumph. One collapsed just after the finish. She was quickly revived and hyrdrated, and looked far more embarrassed  than ill as she watched other finishers from a wheelchair. After the awards ceremony, a band of junior high girls called Still Sapphire performed. Their original name was Sapphire, but some other band invoked its rights to the name. I can only assume that if Sapphire were any good, they would not lose a gig to a band of tweeners, but that is another matter. Racers scattered after the awards ceremony, but many turned up here at Lanskyâs deli, a fine place to replenish calories. The woman across from me is a woman with a finisherâs medal and a large plate of onion rings. The post-race mimosa is not recommended by most running associations, but it appears to be a popular choice. It is raining as I prepare to head to Yankee Stadium. I may be watching a rain delay instead of a ball game for an hour. Some will argue there is little difference. We call those people âPirates fans.â It is cap day. I think I am gonna need one.

June Saturday mornings belong to Little League in parks all over America, and Central Park is no exception. Kids field grounders and whiz by on Razor scooters. Poorly thrown balls bounce onto the footpaths. My own sonâs game starts soon down in the Philly suburbs, and I am thinking of him as I watch these kids, who have better uniforms. Little league game in CP. Surprised I am not blogging this too!  #6sportsSat Jun 11 12:10:15  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier  A sheepdog is playing fetch in front of me, and he is not very good at it. Cyclists pass. Sports belong to all of us on cool mornings, international superstars, nine-year olds who cannot field grounders, dogs who cannot catch Frisbees. What we all need in our lives is the Mini Marathon public address announcer, a woman who embodies the âtough loveâ approach to sports persuasion. âMove it or lose it, ladies!â she shouted as the sweepers at the end of the 6,000 runner field straggled past. âThanks for getting out of bed and joining us this morning!â I need this woman following me and exhorting me as I type. Part life coach, part trash talk specialist. The leaders will pass soon, but it is drizzling, and this laptop is not waterproof. I will check in again soon. The best time to experience Manhattan is in the hours just after dawn, before the throttle butterflies open and everyone starts careening through the day at 120 miles per hour. Manhattan at 6:45 AM is a borough still stretching, gargling, and waiting for the coffee to percolate, a city with its guard down. You know that clarinet solo at the beginning of Rhapsody in Blue? It still warbles at 6:45 AM, not yet drowned out by the mash-up of hip-hop, flimi, and Cookie Monster death metal that keeps the borough moving by day. Skies are overcast this morning. The dense grove of trees at Central Park West looks like a foreboding forest to my right as I report from beneath a fountain near Columbus Circle. I am surrounded by hundreds of distance runners, young and old, ready to compete in the New York Roadrunners Mini-Marathon. The loneliness of the long distance runner intersected with the loneliness of the New Jersey commuter this morning as I shared a PATH train with several harriers, all as eager to speak with a 40-something male stranger with no press credentials as you might expect. One decided to walk the 30 blocks from Penn Station to the starting line along the same route I took, so I decided to try to beat her here. She had fitness and determination on her side; I had a very effective puddle jumping technique. I held a half-block lead until 40th Street, when I paused for a moment to consider stopping by Times headquarters and she flew past me. By 52nd Street, she had a comfortable block lead, but then she turned into a health food store. I win! Now, she gets to run 10 kilometers, and I get to sit and type. We are all winners. Sharing the train with participants reminds me of the beauty of distance running: world class competitors share the event with weekend warriors. It would be like letting commuters onto the NASCAR track, though not quite as dangerous. The announcers just introduced a 79-year participant. There are girls in their teens nearby, and runners of dubious fitness, who will share the event with Olympians. What a wonderful way to start the day. Best of all, it is not 95 degrees. Or raining. Yet.  Tribute to grete waitz “Do what Grete would have done, change someones life for the better.” #6sportsSat Jun 11 11:53:09  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier  Note: Runners will be timed using the Chrono Track B-Tag system, which accurately track individual times and movements. Soon, all citizens will be equipped with them. Noteworthy competitors. Linet Masai: winner of the 2009 World Championships in the 10K and Olympic competitor who finished fourth in 2008 in the 10,000 meters, which is an event of roughly similar length. (Kidding!) Masaiâs personal best time in the one million centimeter event is 30 minutes and 48 seconds, which can cause blogging problems. Write too long a paragraph about Masaiâs amazing start, and I may be spellchecking as she crosses the finish line. Liliya Shobukhova, who has won marathons in London and Chicago and competed in the 5,000-meter event in the 2004 and 2008 Olympics. Shobukhova is famous for her ability to sprint at the end of a marathon: in Chicago in 2009, she ran the final 2.2 kilometers in six minutes and 23 seconds. In a less genteel sport, such a gift would be accompanied by excessive trash talking. âWhat, you are tired? Itâs only been 24 miles! Gosh, I wonder whatâs around that next bend. I will run ahead, take a look, come back, and let you know before you drop from exhaustion.â Harriers are nicer people than this.  Deena Kastor, winner of the 2004 event. Kastor also won a bronze medal in the 2004 Olympics and holds U.S. womenâs records in the marathon and half marathon. She is also a new mother, competing in her first race since the birth of her daughter in February. I wonder what kind of jogging strollers distance runners use. Hopefully something with good suspension, and a DVD player on board so the little one can enjoy some Blues Clues over the final few miles. I believe strollers are forbidden in this event. They always are in Philadelphia, where mothers might affix Ben Hur Greek Chariot wheels to the strollers, then boo the toddlers who topple onto the sidewalk. Kastor also has a degree in journalism, making her not only far more qualified than me to compete in distance runs, but also far more qualified to write about them. Alas, search engines always assume I am looking for reality-television vixen Deena Cortese when I research Kastor; place third in the Olympics and achieve world-record times in grueling sports, and and you are still doomed to play second fiddle to a person who calls herself âThe Blast.â Race will start soon. Check the Twitter feed for updates! Thereâs a fine line between âedgy journalistic experimentâ and âelaborate practical joke.â I believe that line runs through the East River under the R.F.K. Bridge, and I will be crossing it, on foot, in the late afternoon on Saturday, possibly in the rain. When my editors contacted me about covering six different sporting events in 24 hours, I wondered if they were really plotting a complicated hoax at my expense. The more they described the project, the more I wondered. No press credentials? Right. Tweets, photos and video? Sure. I kept waiting for the instructions that proved they were kidding. Oh, wear this 25-pound satellite dish on your head, and make sure it is always pointed in the direction of 40th Street so we can pick up your signal. Walk sideways if you have to. It never reached the point at which no one on the conference call could keep from snickering. Not quite. My wife was even more skeptical. âWhat makes you so sure this is not a joke?â she asked. âWell, they want me to start and end the trip in Newarkâ¦â âJoke!â she said. âAnd I am supposed to cover a track meet at iCarly Stadium out on Rikerâs Islandâ¦â âDouble joke!â she said. I soon clarified that the track meet was to take place at Icahn Stadium on Randallâs Island, but my confusion only underlined the absurdity of the task for which I too eagerly signed up. I have never covered track and field, and I donât know Randallâs Island from Brigadoon. I would only be slightly further out of my element if The Times sent me to Jupiter. I am spectacularly unqualified for this. But then, thatâs the point: I will cover events with a fresh voice and examine the New York sports scene with the wonder, confusion and enthusiasm of someone encountering the Belmont Stakes or a Central Park mini-marathon for the first time. Of course, thatâs exactly what you would tell a freelance writer if you wanted to trick him into doing something foolish, right? Heedless of my own skepticism, let alone my wifeâs, I accepted the assignment and began mapping a route that would take me from Red Bull Arena to Central Park to Yankee Stadium to Randallâs Island to Belmont Park and back to the Prudential Center in Newark as cheaply and efficiently as possible. So I logged onto an M.T.A. transit map, or possibly a diagram of the circuit board of a microchip, or a chart of the circulatory system of a wombat. It did not matter; I barely made sense of the map. It looked like my 4-year-oldâs scribbles, or the random pathways of the old Atari game Maze Craze. The M.T.A. people could have put a Minotaur in Forest Hills, and I would have accepted it as fact. New Yorkers have no trouble keeping this tangle of letters, numbers and colors straight, just as children of the rainforest can canoe around the Amazon tributaries without getting lost. I am from Philadelphia, with one main subway line and a few spurs. I am an algebra commuter in a calculus city. Google Maps, which have clearly marked transit stops, were a little more helpful. I learned that my trip will take me through a parade of neighborhoods I thought only existed on rap albums and in Martin Scorsese films. Like any good out-of-towner, I immediately feared that hoodlums of every era and nationality would menace me at every stop. I was reviewing a Google Map, listening to Reasonable Doubt, watching âGoodfellas,â and trembling silently when an editor suggested the best way to get from the Adidas Grand Prix on Randallâs Island to the Belmont Stakes was to leave the island on foot, then find a cab in Astoria, Queens. Somehow, this actually assuaged my fears. I excitedly told my wife of the plan. âAll I have to do is take a train from Yankee Stadium to Harlem, pick up a bus to the island, walk across the East River on I-287, then take a cab through Queens to Belmont Park, which is just east of Hollis and Jamaica!â âJoke!â she said. The easy leg of this odyssey is already complete: I successfully navigated the New Jersey Turnpike on a summer Friday, no small feat with shoregoers clogging many exits. Major league soccer did its best to work its charms on a gorgeous Friday evening, treating me to a tight 2-1 Red Bulls victory that featured three more goals than I anticipated seeing. Weather perfect. Venue gorgeous. Crowd excited. Blogger clueless but willing. Let’s play some soccer! #6sportsSat Jun 11 00:09:05  via MOTOBLURMichael TanierFO_MTanier  Red Bull Arena had everything I could ask for in a venue: wide concourses, great sight lines and ranch dressing dispensers on the condiment tables. The Red Bulls fans were passionate and intense, and a vocal busload of boosters from New England brought pageantry in the form of a drum-and-flag mini-parade through the concourses. I did not bother with the chanting, stomping superfans behind the goalie because they appeared more into being soccer fans than into soccer, carefully mimicking the behavior they saw in World Cup matches. To each their own. The fans in my corner section, schoolboys with their fathers and fetching collegiate couples, rooted without making a show of rooting. I did not fall in love with the sport, but I saw the attraction, and if I were in charge of a sport that makes a fetish of its deliberate, kid-unfriendly pace (baseball), I would be worried about soccerâs ability to slowly erode the fan base. The trip to Red Bull Arena reminded me why this assignment appealed so much to me, besides my masochistic streak. Sports fandom is becoming increasingly private and personal. High-def television beams pristine images into our homes, and computers place instantaneous analysis and impersonal chat at our fingertips. Even the act of going to games has been sanitized in recent years: the new arenas look and feel like shopping malls, and tailgate parties often come with vegetarian menu alternatives and air-conditioned, commode-equipped trailers. None of these are bad things, but they take some of the most powerful, visceral experiences away from fans. We start to ask too much of the sports themselves, entertainment and fulfillment-wise, when we remove them from their atmosphere. The best fan experiences are usually communal, and they are often journeys. Whole books have been written about road trips following college football teams or European tours with futbÃ³l hooligans. To date, no one has written eloquently about watching a ballgame alone in a suburban living room. Our childhood sports memories are usually of trips to the ballpark or arena, even if the pretzels were cold, the parking lots were endless, and Von Hayes was batting cleanup that night. My goal this weekend is to create some new sports memories, then shape them and share them, to try things I have never tried and find things I would never think to look for. This is not just a New York story, but a story of sports discovery. Maybe an afternoon on Randallâs Island will open my eyes to the beauty of the triple jump. Maybe I will win big at the Belmont. Maybe the views from the R.F.K. Bridge are so breathtaking that they are worth the tight schedule, unpredictable weather, and possibility that I will be hopelessly lost the moment I set foot in Queens. This journey will be funny at times, but it will never be a joke. I may not find all of my venues, but I am sure I will find something. Start following Tanier on Twitter: @FO_MTanier.
