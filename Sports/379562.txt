Advertisement  Jose Canseco, the Oakland Athletics' outfielder, will undergo surgery today to remove part of a bone in his left wrist and will be out of the lineup six to eight weeks. Canseco has been sidelined all season by the wrist injury. He suffered a fracture of the hamate bone in his wrist this spring. In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Canseco was fined $500 yesterday for driving at speeds exceeding 125 m.p.h. in February. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
