Advertisement  FRANK ROBINSON, who was dismissed as manager of the Baltimore Orioles on May 23, has agreed to become an assistant general manager for the team, according to the Orioles and ED KEATING , Robinson's agent. "We're obviously pleased that Frank will continue to be an important member of the Orioles family," said ROLAND HEMOND , the executive vice president and general manager. Robinson's contract stipulated that he would become assistant general manager in case he was removed as manager. Negotiations between Robinson and the team focused on defining his duties, not on money, according to Keating, who said Robinson preferred to stay with the Orioles, even at a lower salary, than try to get a job with another team. He will be involved in trades and acquisitions, planning the team's new Camden Yards stadium and Florida training facilities. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
