PATRIOTS AT DOLPHINS
7 p.m. Eastern, ESPN
Line: Patriots by 4 Like a popular sitcom that has been on the air far too long, the Patriots have begun resorting to gimmicks to keep fans interested. Replacing Randy Moss with Chad Ochocinco was a Charlie Sheen-for-Ashton Kutcher move, and the tropes that kept us hooked five years ago â Bill Belichickâs slovenly grouchiness, Tom Bradyâs cocky charm â are lapsing into parody. The team even stooped to add a bunch of lovable youngsters to the cast last season, with Aaron Hernandez and Danny Woodhead among the precious, precocious newcomers. The stunt casting continued into last week, when the team added a second Gronkowski (Dan, joining his brother Ron) to appeal to 18- to 35-year-old viewers. While the current Patriots do not compare to the golden era teams of 2001-4, they do not have to: all of the changes have kept the quality high, even if the story line has grown stale. With Ochocinco, defensive linemen Albert Haynesworth and Shaun Ellis and a deep draft class led by right tackle Nate Solder (who could make his first start Monday night) joining a roster that won 14 games last season, the Patriots are a lock for another season of double-digit wins and a joust with the Jets for the division title. The Dolphins are just hoping to avoid midseason cancellation. ï¤
Pick: Patriotsï£ RAIDERS AT BRONCOS
10:15 p.m. Eastern, ESPN
Line: Broncos by 1 The new Broncos coach John Fox is a methodical team builder who often made the most of minimal talent with the Carolina Panthers. That makes him the ideal replacement for Josh McDaniels, one of the N.F.L.âs leading causes of minimal talent. During the McDaniels Diaspora of 2008-9, the impatient young coach traded away quarterback Jay Cutler, running back Peyton Hillis, receiver Brandon Marshall and draft picks that other teams used to select receivers Dez White and Mike Wallace, among others. In exchange, the Broncos received three quarterbacks  â Kyle Orton, Brady Quinn and Tim Tebow â  and a lot of very dubious prospects. With McDanielsâs reign over, Fox brings the promise of stability, something both Broncos fans and the teamâs owner, Pat Bowlen, crave. âI donât want to say Josh was a bad coach,â Bowlen told The Denver Post. âHe just didnât have the level of experience that made me comfortable. John does.â Bowlen has the luxury of thousands and thousands of others who will say that McDaniels was a bad coach. Fox reinstalled Orton as the starting quartterback, but Tebow could not be dragged away from the game plan, so he will see some action in what the Broncos call the Wild Horse package. The Raiders also changed coaches this off-season, promoting the offensive coordinator Hue Jackson to replace Tom Cable. Jackson has coached for five teams in the last eight years, but stability is not what the Raiders are all about.
