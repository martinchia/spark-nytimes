 Michael Zampino leaned in and lowered his voice to a whisper, so that maybe his customers would not hear him. There was a long line forming outside his shop, the Lemon Ice King of Corona, on Tuesday afternoon, and he did not want to offend anyone. “I’m a Yankees fan,” he said softly and with a sheepish grin. Citi Field is in walking distance of the shop. After games, Mets fans flock there for the Italian ice. This neighborhood, Corona, of all places, seems as if it would be a haven for Mets fans. But evidently, Yankees fans have invaded. According to data from Facebook, across New York City, in every single ZIP code, the Yankees have drawn more “likes” than the Mets. Even along the blocks closest to Citi Field, in the ZIP code 11368, which includes Corona and Zampino’s Italian ice shop, Yankees fans outnumber Mets fans by more than 2 to 1, the data shows. Of course, there are no real neighborhoods immediately around Citi Field. It is surrounded on three sides by an expansive parking lot. And on the fourth, beyond 126th Street, is a line of maybe a dozen run-down body shops. Advertisement Beyond that, to the west is Corona, to the east is Flushing, and to the north is Flushing Bay. Corona is a mostly Hispanic working-class area, with about 22 percent of residents living below the poverty line. Flushing is mostly Asian now and is also working-class. Advertisement Julissa Ferreras, the area’s City Council member, noted that many people there did not own computers, let alone Facebook accounts. She sounded weary talking about the prevalence of Yankees fans in the area, as if it were expected. 
                An interactive map of the geography of baseball fandom.             “The Mets should be more upset” than she is, she said. Zampino grew up in Corona, too, a few blocks from the shop. His father, a Yankees fan before the Mets existed, taught him to love the Yankees, the tradition, all the winning. Zampino started working at the shop when he was 16. Peter Benfaremo, the owner, was like a second father to him. Zampino and his partner, Vinnie Barbaccia, who is also a Yankees fan, bought the shop from Benfaremo about 22 years ago. On a recent afternoon, told about Facebook’s data, Zampino turned to Barbaccia and said, “He wants to know why people around here are Yankee fans.” “Why? They’re the Yankees,” Barbaccia said, grinning. Zampino explained: “The Yankees have been winning. It’s the winning, 100 percent. If you asked that question in the ’80s, if Facebook was around, it’d be all Mets.” Frank Messina, who published a book of poems about the Mets, said it took courage to publicly declare one’s allegiance to the Mets with a “like” on Facebook “Being a Mets fan requires admitting to a lot of self-inflicted turmoil,” he said. And if most people posted only positive or self-assuring things on social media, he figured it made sense that more people “liked” the Yankees. “But what if there was a button that said you ‘disliked’ the Yankees?” he said. “There would probably be more people that said they dislike the Yankees than like. With the Mets, people wouldn’t care.” Advertisement Omar Minaya lived around here in the 1980s, long before he worked as the Mets’ general manager from 2004 to 2010. He was born in the Dominican Republic, but he moved to Corona, Queens, when he was 8 and stayed until he was 31. Baseball was big in the neighborhood then, he said, and almost everyone was a Mets fan. “I was a little bit of a front-runner,” he said, chuckling. “I liked the Mets when they won.” Naturally, Minaya loved Tom Seaver. He said the Mets lost a lot of fair-weather fans when they traded Seaver in 1977. The neighborhood has changed a lot since then, he said. People seem to prefer soccer. Minaya still visits the neighborhood about three times a month. Go to Leo’s Latticini on 104th Street, he said. That’s Corona. That is where the real Mets fans are, he said.

From the outside, the deli, also called Mama’s of Corona, looked like the last bastion of Mets fans in the neighborhood. In the windows, there were Mets posters, flags, stuffed dolls and pompoms, making one giant blue-and-orange collage. Inside, there were bigger Mets flags; a jersey signed by the 2000 team; a ball signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers’ Ralph Branca and the New York Giants’ Bobby Thomson, the pitcher and hitter linked by 1951’s Shot Heard Round the World; and lots of photographs. David Wright had stopped by. So had the Wilpons, and Brian Cashman, and Minaya — he’s a regular. Bobby Valentine once tried to go into the kitchen and cook the sauce. Irene and Marie DeBenedittis laughed at the memories. Their grandparents started the deli more than 80 years ago. By word of mouth, Mama’s became a Mets staple. Now they cater the food in the visitors’ clubhouse and have a stand in Citi Field. During their hiring process, they ask, Yankees or Mets? “Most of them say they’re not into baseball,” Marie said. “Those are the smart ones,” Irene said. “They want a job.” When they were told that the Facebook data showed Mets fans to be a distinct minority in the area, Irene’s eyes widened, as if she had seen a ghost. Advertisement “It’s true,” Marie said sadly. “I think there are a lot more Yankee fans. We allow them in, but we give them a hard time. It’s very hard to be a Met fan. Especially around the World Series — that’s the worst. Yankee fans are very mean. Well, some are.” The Yankees fan invasion has spread to Flushing, too. In the ZIP code 11355, to the east, Yankees fans also outnumber Mets fans by 2 to 1, the data shows. On Tuesday night, from Main Street, you could see Citi Field lit up in the distance. And amid all the Asian restaurants, shops and boutiques, if you ducked down 41st Avenue, there was a beacon in a night — a neon Mets sign in the window of Kelly’s Pub. Stephen Walsh, a firefighter, sat alone at the end of the bar, watching the Mets game, sipping on a Guinness. He has spent most of his life in Flushing and has been around long enough to see the neighborhood become a thriving Chinatown. This bar’s appeal was simple: Whoever was sitting next to him was likely to be a Mets fan. Outside, he could not tell anymore. Maybe Facebook was right. Maybe there were more Yankees fans. He did not seem to care. “As Mets fans, we’re used to being losers,” he said.
