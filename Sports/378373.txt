JUPITER, Fla. â The theatrics surrounding the Mets ace Johan Santana continued on Sunday. Santana threw off a pitching mound at the Metsâ spring training site in Port St. Lucie a day after General Manager Sandy Alderson appeared to upbraid him for not being in shape. Alderson said Saturday that the Mets and Santana had agreed that Santana would scale back his workouts in the off-season after his abbreviated 2012 season, which followed a season missed to shoulder surgery. Yet Alderson also said he was disappointed that Santana, who will earn more than $25 million this year, had arrived in Florida not ready to pitch. Alderson and Manager Terry Collins added that it was growing more likely that Santana, who appeared upset by the accusation, would not be on the opening day roster because his training was behind schedule. On Sunday, the Mets played down the spat. Even though Alderson said it might be days before Santana threw off a mound, Collins said he was not surprised Santana did precisely that on Sunday. Yet he said he would let Santana dictate when he was ready. âIf itâs April 1, terrific; if itâs April 5, great; if itâs April 15, thatâs the way it is,â Collins said. âItâs about you being able to run out there 30 times next summer, and if that means weâll have to slow the pace down, then weâll do it.â The pitching coach Dan Warthen offered a clearer view of why Alderson might have expressed disappointment. âThere were comments, and maybe they were motivational, even by the general manager because he didnât say he was going to be out there for a few days, and Johan said, âIâll prove you wrong,â â Warthen said. âMaybe it was a pretty good motivational thing.â A version of this article appears in print on 03/04/2013, on page D6 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Something Motivates Santana to Throw.
