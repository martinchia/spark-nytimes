Advertisement  The Philadelphia 76ers were scheduled to hold a news conference today amid speculation that Coach JIM LYNAM would be replaced by the former Denver Nugget coach DOUG MOE. A 76er spokesman, ZACK HILL, refused last night to comment on the report, broadcast nationally during the Portland-Utah playoff game on NBC. Lynam has a 194-173 record as the head coach of the 76ers over the past five seasons. He guided the team to a 35-47 record this season as Philadelphia missed the playoffs. Moe coached the Denver Nuggets for 10 seasons before being dismissed on Sept. 5, 1990. He coached the Nuggets to two Midwest Division titles and was named the league's Coach of the Year in 1987-88.
