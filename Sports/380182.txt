Known for his daring, and sometimes puzzling, strategy on the field, Louisiana State Coach Les Miles has also managed to keep fans and reporters alike entertained with his singular vocabulary. When Miles appears at his weekly news media luncheon during the season, his answers to seemingly simple questions often travel a long, scenic route before arriving at the final period. When quarterback Jordan Jefferson was preparing to return from a suspension in late September after being charged for his role in a preseason bar fight, Miles was asked what Jefferson would add to L.S.U.âs offense. âI think itâs also important to realize that with another skill set, you would soon introduce Jordan Jefferson to an opportunity to playing some of the time,â Miles said. Opaque sentence structure is not Milesâs only verbal tic, however. He is also fond of using words in places where even the most creative linguist may not have seen them fitting. For example, in discussing the sophomore defensive back Tyrann Mathieu before the season, Miles said he brought a âsuddennessâ to the position. He is also fond of the phrase âget alongâ and its apparently versatile applications. Once, when discussing the former L.S.U. running back Trindon Holliday, who was slight of stature, Miles said that he had âget-along in his frame.â More recently, after reports surfaced that Mathieu, running back Spencer Ware and cornerback Tharold Simon would be suspended for L.S.U.âs game against Auburn, Miles batted away the word âsuspensionâ in a way that was almost Clintonian. âI donât recall that I ever suspended them,â Miles said. âI withheld them from play.â In the lexicon of Les Miles, it all made perfect sense. Chris Branch is a senior at Louisiana State University and the associate managing editor of The Daily Reveille, the student newspaper. He will be filing dispatches from Baton Rouge every day this week to preview No. 1 L.S.U.’s game at No. 2 Alabama on Saturday night.
