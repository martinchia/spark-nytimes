Advertisement  The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Indianapolis Colts, the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings yesterday continued their searches for new coaches. SAM WYCHE, who roamed and fumed on the Bengals' sideline until a Christmas Eve falling out with the Cincinnati general manager, MIKE BROWN, was interviewed in Tampa, Fla., yesterday. (Wyche issued a statement in which he said NBC and CBS were also on his list.) The next chat scheduled for the Buccaneers' vacancy is with BUDDY RYAN, the former coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, on Monday. Also yesterday, CHUCK KNOX took himself off the Indianapolis Colts' list. Hours before Knox, the former Seattle Seahawks coach, was scheduled to be interviewed in Indianapolis, he called to say he wouldn't come unless he was first offered the job. He didn't go. "We're not going to put an offer on the table and then begin the interview process," said Colts General Manager JIM IRSAY, who added that he believed Knox already had an offer from either the Los Angeles Rams or the Green Bay Packers.

The Steelers also plan to interview the assistant coaches DAVE WANNSTEDT of Dallas, BILL COWHER of Kansas City and WOODY WIDENHOFER of Detroit, but cannot talk to them while their teams are in the playoffs.
