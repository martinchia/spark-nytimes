Advertisement  The Florida Panthers tonight all but conceded the Islanders the final Eastern Conference spot in the National Hockey League playoffs. Florida looked tentative and its goalie, John Vanbiesbrouck, was benched midway through the second period in a 5-2 loss to the hapless Quebec Nordiques before 14,700 at Miami Arena. The loss left the Panthers with 81 points, 1 behind the Islanders, who can clinch the playoff berth with a victory or tie at Tampa Bay Wednesday night or, failing that, a victory or tie here on Thursday. The Panthers are now winless in their last eight games (0-3-5). Vanbiesbrouck allowed 3 goals on 12 shots, and 9 minutes 42 seconds into the second period was replaced by Mark Fitzpatrick. Vanbiesbrouck has not been nearly as effective since missing 17 days in February with a thumb injury. He is 4-12-3 since returning, and 0-5-1 in his last six, after a celebrated 16-13-8 start for this first-year expansion team. "It's a very empty feeling to let your teammates down," he said. In Landover, Md., the Washington Capitals wrapped up seventh place in the Eastern Conference by beating Winnipeg, 4-3. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
