7:22 p.m. | Updated Coach Mike Locksley was fired Sunday, New Mexico announced. The associate head coach George Barlow will serve as the interim coach for remainder of the season. Despite the calendar not yet flipping to October, there are two programs that appear destined for coaching changes. There arenât two more hopeless programs in college football right now than Memphis and New Mexico. Memphis has lost by a combined score of 148-20 to its three Football Bowl Subdivision opponents. (It did beat Austin Peay on Sept. 17 for a 1-3 record.) New Mexico lost in overtime to Sam Houston State of the F.B.S. on Saturday to fall to 0-4. Its losing margin against F.B.S. opponents is 125-26. While Larry Porterâs job is in danger for his ineptitude on the field, Mike Locksley has both on and off-field issues. The arrest of a 19-year-old who claimed to be a New Mexico football recruit while driving a car registered to Locksley on Saturday night compounds Locksleyâs problems. (A New Mexico statement said that the car belonged to Locksleyâs son and that the 19-year-old, Joshua Butts, is not a Lobos recruit.) Locksley has also been accused of age discrimination and sexual harassment by his former secretary, charges that were dropped, and given a âverbal reprimandâ for an altercation with an assistant coach. It is difficult to imagine New Mexico, which has already reduced Locksleyâs buyout, putting up with the losing on the field and the embarrassment off it.
