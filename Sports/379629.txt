Sift through any premature breakdown of this yearâs race for most valuable player, and you find one name conspicuously absent. Kevin Durant, after a summer of Team USA competition, quiet humility, and public relations goodwill, started the season a bit slowly. By Durant’s standards, this means heâs averaged a gaudy 27.3 points per game, but in a slightly less efficient manner than weâve all grown accustomed.  Thereâs no reason to be alarmed, even if Oklahoma City is a step below their expected standing. Durant and the Thunder havenât necessarily regressed, even if they didnât begin this season on the same high note that concluded 2009-10. This may just be the way the Thunder operate, meaning December is the true beginning of the Thunderâs season. For a taste of the Thunderâs in-season development, take a look at Durantâs shooting percentages from the field and from three-point range last year â the landmark season in Thunder history and the outset of Durant’s superstardom â in comparison to this one: 
This kind of slow burn is characteristic of Durant and the Thunder at the outset of the season, it appears. Not every team can start off on a tear, and Oklahoma City seems comfortable easing into rhythm over the seasonâs opening months. His December was particularly prolific, as Durant averaged 29.4 points (on 51.8 percent shooting from the field and 40 percent from three), 6.3 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game in 11 games. Russell Westbrookâs emergence as a legitimate N.B.A. star has also somewhat obscured Durantâs climb back toward excellence, but more than anything itâs the early-season and late-season bias that so often taints the most valuable player race and any other estimations of player value. Westbrook amazed instantly, which makes his season a bit more memorable than Durantâs gradual ascent from merely productive to both prolific and efficient.  Durant has picked up where he left off, with a 44-point Christmas Day performance spotlighting his return to prominence. The Thunder, which still sit in fifth place in the West and just a game out of the fourth seed, appear ready for a proper charge. In retrospect, their slow start and eventual boom should have been anticipated, given the team’s performance a year ago. The Thunderâs slow start last season has become understood as part of that teamâs narrative, but there seems to be a misunderstanding in exactly what that slow start meant for the future; Oklahoma City definitely improved as the season went on, but that process apparently isnât linear from one season to the next, as many predicted. The Thunder wonât get better and better and better. Theyâll improve, stall, and eventually improve some more, but itâs not a progression you can set your watch by. Rather than think of each Thunder (and Durant) season as a direct continuation of the previous one, perhaps they are part of a Spursian rhythm. Each year has its ebb and flow, and Sam Prestiâs new home seems to have similar tidal patterns to his old one. The Thunder â and Durant, in particular â start slow, rev up, and if last year is any indication, theyâll be ready to roll by playoff time. Thatâs not unlike the esteemed Spurs, who have characteristically slogged through the regular season before surging into the playoffs. Thereâs no guarantee that Oklahoma City will be primed for the postseason, but the Thunder are still better situated at this point in the season than they were last year, and the projections for Durant are just as optimistic. Oklahoma City hasnât seized the Western Conference by the throat, but its slow climb to high ground could nonetheless put a talented, improved Thunder team in a dangerous position at seasonâs end.
