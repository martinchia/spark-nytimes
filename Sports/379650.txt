 Cam Newton’s news conference at the scouting combine on Saturday was subject to interpretation — a Rorschach test for the news media.  Was he too rehearsed? Was he sincere? This video gives you a chance to judge for yourself.  Last week, Newton, the Auburn quarterback and Heisman winner, raised some eyebrows by saying he saw himself as an “entertainer-slash-icon.” Here is part of Newton’s opening statement, in which he addressed the comment: First and foremost, I understand that my obligation is to be the best possible football player I can be. I know and believe that. The recent comments that were made during the announcement of my recent endorsement partnership. I was making the point that I want to be the best possible ambassador for them, just like I want to be the best possible ambassador for whatever team I’m lucky enough to play for. I’m excited to compete this week, and you will see me doing everything possible to become the best player I can possibly be. And here is some of the reaction from around the Web: Dan Graziano, FanHouse:
Newton is confident. He is engaging. He has a superstar’s smile and a well-earned belief in himself that should make teams feel better, not worse, about making him their quarterback. He wears the mistakes of his past with a grown-up’s wisdom and perspective. Pete Prisco, CBSSports.com: 
Asked about the interview process, Newton said, “I’m pretty sure everybody in the combine is going through that process asking themselves the question, ‘Is this really what I want to do.'” What? Is this what you want to do? Doesn’t that contradict his statement that he wants to do everything he can to be the best? You can’t be a star without the scrutiny — no matter how much he might want it. Jason Cole, Yahoo Sports:
  In about an hourâs worth of interviews with the media, Arkansasâ Ryan Mallett saw his draft stock crumble and Auburnâs Cam Newton kept his soaring. Don Banks, SI.com:
I guess that was just Cam being Cam. The explanatory opening statement read rather stiffly. The multiple references to himself in thI ird person: “Everyone knows Cam comes from a spread offense.” And the Mark McGwire-like insistence that “the past is in the past.” Extra point:  Why do some people refer to themselves in the third person?
