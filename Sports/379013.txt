After spending the 2011 season watching line drives get eaten up by infielders aligned toward right field, Mark Teixeira is finally ready to play some small ball. Teixeira was noticeably affected last year by the defensive shifts that sent three infielders to the right side of the field when he batted left-handed. He had been reluctant to change his pull-oriented approach â perhaps sending a few bunts down the third-base line — because he thought it would hurt his power and productivity. But Teixeira batted just .224 from the left side of the plate, and frustration finally took its toll. Teixeira said Tuesday night that he was eager to experiment with bunting once the Yankees convene for spring training in Tampa, Fla. He said he might attempt one bunt each game. âI always mess around with it, but itâs something you canât work on without live pitching,â Teixeira said. âI may lay down 20 bunts this spring.â  Teixeira said the last time he recalled bunting was as a freshman in high school. He added that he beat the throw to first to notch a base hit. Teixeira, who was honored Tuesday night in Manhattan at the annual Thurman Munson Awards Dinner, which benefits the AHRC-New York City Foundation, said he had already made another important adjustment this off-season. He lost a considerable amount of weight, he said, by changing to a healthier diet. And he was was light-hearted when asked about the Yankeesâ competition this year. Teixeira joked that the pitching machines at Bobby Valentineâs baseball academy in Stamford, Conn., where he trains in the off-season, began to malfunction after Valentine was named manager of the Boston Red Sox.   Also noting the additions of first basemen Prince Fielder and Albert Pujols to the American League this winter, he said, âIf I get one or two votes for the All-Star Game, Iâll be happy.â The New York Times reporters Tyler Kepner, Ben Shpigel, Jack Curry and Joe Lapointe, along with their Times colleagues, will bring baseball fans inside the run up to the 2008 baseball season with access, analysis and the latest updates from spring training.
