Advertisement  WINNING the Indianapolis 500 brings a driver fame and fortune, but not immunity from the rules of racing as the 1990 Indy winner, Arie Luyendyk, has just learned. When the Dutch driver ignored a checkered caution flag Friday and ran three fast laps during a qualifying session for the Molson-Indy race today in Toronto, he was promptly called onto the carpet, fined and placed on probation for the rest of the Indy-car season. That means he will face further and stiffer penalties for another infraction. Wally Dallenbach, the chief steward for CART, the circuit's sanctioning body, did not disclose the amount of the fine when he announced the penalties yesterday, but Luyendyk had no complaint. ''I accept the fine and I understand why they are doing it,'' said the gentleman whose engine crossed the finish line first in Indianapolis eight weeks ago. ''All I can say is I didn't do it intentionally and I'm sorry for any rules infractions.''(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
