Advertisement  Former Heisman Trophy winner PAT SULLIVAN became head coach at Texas Christian yesterday and vowed to guide the Horned Frogs to the Cotton Bowl. It's about an hour's drive from the school in Fort Worth to the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, but T.C.U. hasn't been there in 33 years. T.C.U. is recovering from N.C.A.A. sanctions imposed in 1985 for rules violations. The 41-year-old Sullivan tutored Auburn's quarterbacks as an assistant coach the past six years.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
