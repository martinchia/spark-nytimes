 CONCORD, N.C. —  Jeff Gordon, the Sprint Cup standings leader and a four-time series champion, said Saturday that back spasms could force him out of Sunday’s Coca-Cola 600. Gordon, 42, has made 736 consecutive starts dating to the 1992 season finale and has never missed a race. Gordon practiced briefly Saturday before deciding that he could not continue. He said he would rest for a day in the hope that he could compete Sunday night in the No. 24 Chevrolet in Nascar’s longest race of the season. Regan Smith, a Nationwide Series driver and a Cup veteran, planned to be on standby to replace Gordon before or during the race if needed. Gordon is off to a strong start this season. He won his first race May 10 at Kansas Speedway.
