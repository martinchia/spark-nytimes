Advertisement  MARY SLANEY, suffering from a virus, yesterday withdrew from her planned confrontation against ZOLA BUDD PIETERSE in a 2,000-meter race at the TSB track and field meet in London. The two were to compete today in their first meeting in seven years. They last raced against each other in Europe in 1985, a year after Slaney tripped on Pieterse's barefoot heel in the 3,000-meter final at the Los Angeles Olympics.
