Advertisement  The Seattle SuperSonics, stung by consecutive home losses to Orlando and Charlotte, lost their coach, K. C. JONES, yesterday. He was fired hours after a 1-point overtime loss to the Hornets. The move caught the Seattle team by surprise. And it was one that the Sonics' president, BOB WHITSITT, didn't want to make. "But at this time, we need to go in a different direction," Whitsitt said in a release. When he named Jones as head coach in May 1990, Whitsitt had hoped that the coach's laid-back style and winning past as a former player and coach with 10 Boston Celtic National Basketball Association championship teams would rub off on the Sonics. Jones led Seattle to a 41-41 record and a playoff berth last season. But the Sonics, tied for fifth in the Pacific Division, are 18-18 this season and have lost their last three games. And Jones himself was stunned by Tuesday night's loss to the Hornets, in which the home crowd of 9,132 booed the lackluster effort. "I'd have booed us, too," said EDDIE JOHNSON, a Sonics forward. "Games like this are becoming a familiar pattern against teams that we should beat with ease." Whitsitt has day named an assistant coach, BOB KLOPPENBURG, as interim coach. Another assistant, KIP MOTTA, was also fired.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
