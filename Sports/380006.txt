Advertisement  In one hotel on the same day, sports commissioners, sports agents, sports medicine experts and sports officials will meet, mingle and talk. It is the annual Sports Summit at the Marriott Marquis in Manhattan. For $595, anyone can attend the two-day session, which starts tomorrow. Goldspur Rodeo of Brazil will be side by side with the Fuji Bank, while the City of St. Louis will have a representative along with the San Antonio Convention and Visitors Bureau. Want to know how to get foreign financing for your new domed arena? There will be a seminar. Among many speakers: ALAN ROTHENBERG of World Cup Soccer U.S.A. 1994, and CHARLES H.
