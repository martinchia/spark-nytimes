Having lost 16 consecutive games to the San Antonio Spurs entering Fridayâs contest, the Golden State Warriors would probably have tried anything to get a win. It turned out, all they needed were sleeves. The Warriors were the butt of quite a few jokes for introducing a jersey that resembles a T-shirt more than a traditional tank top, but the players were not complaining after their 107-101 overtime victory. The criticism from fans focused largely on the jerseysâ looking like warm-ups, as did most of the jokes on Twitter that the Warriors had forgotten to remove their shooting shirts. But Paul Lukas, one of the worldâs leading experts on uniform design through his work with ESPN and his Uni Watch Web site, said the jerseys were not the problem. âI thought all along they looked good,â Lukas said. âI kind of dig the sleeves, personally. I think it opens up more possibilities for basketball design because the real problem with basketball uniform design is there is so little real estate to work with.â  Yet the combination of a gold jersey with striped shorts did not work for Lukas. âI donât know what they were thinking pairing up this nonpinstriped jersey with pinstriped shorts,â Lukas said. âI thought it looked ridiculous. No basketball player needs pinstripes. Theyâre all very tall. They donât need to accentuate the vertical.â But the jerseys will take the blame. âI think a lot of people are going to ridicule the overall effect, and the sleeves are going to take the fall for that,â Lukas said. âIf they had simply had plain gold shorts, I think they wouldnât have looked as stupid, and people would have assessed the sleeves on their own.â The jerseys did not set a basketball precedent. Lukas said many college uniforms in past years had sleeves, with Evansville wearing them as recently as 2002. This year, Adidas has a design in place, and Lukas said to expect at least a few teams to wear them during the N.C.A.A. tournament. What the jerseys offer teams beyond anything else is a product to sell to fans who would otherwise be unlikely to buy a basketball jersey. âA lot of people who will buy a baseball jersey or a football jersey arenât going to buy a basketball jersey because a tank top has a more limited range of situations in which you can wear it,â Lukas said. âIt is less forgiving for certain body shapes and sizes, and thereâs a resistance to buying a tank top.â Whether their jerseys catch on with other teams or fans, the Warriors certainly got people talking. Many recalled that Patrick Ewing during his Georgetown days wore a gray T-shirt under his jersey. Other uniform eccentricities like the shorts worn by the Chicago White Sox were also mentioned, but Lukas said people missed a much closer comparison. He likened the Warriorsâ jerseys to the Cooperalls long pants that the Philadelphia Flyers and the Hartford Whalers tried in the 1980s. âItâs something weâve never seen,â Lukas said, comparing the Warriorsâ jerseys to Cooperalls. âIt challenges our conception of what a basketball uniform is supposed to look like.â Cooperalls were eventually banned by the N.H.L. for being too slick, which resulted in playersâ sliding too quickly into the boards. But Lukas listed them among his favorite uniform innovations and expressed hope that people will be patient with the sleeved N.B.A. jerseys. But what could keep players from adopting the new look is something that Adidas and the Warriors may not have considered. âOne thing you have to think about is that these guys have carefully manicured tattoos,â Lukas said. âThese sleeves are going to cover those.â To some basketball fans, that may not be much of an issue.
