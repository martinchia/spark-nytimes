Advertisement By GORDON S. WHITE JR. and SPECIAL TO THE NEW YORK TIMES The top of the national rankings underwent a major realignment Saturday with Washington State's 34-30 upset of U.C.L.A. (7-1), which was ranked No. 1 in the news agency polls and No. 2 by The New York Times in its computer ranking. Not only that, but the Heisman Trophy battle may have become a much closer contest than it appeared to be a few days ago. A game that had a big bearing on those votes took place here, where West Virginia (8-0) showed no first-half mercy for Penn State on its way to beating the Nittany Lions, 51-30. Troy Aikman, the U.C.L.A. quarterback who was considered the front-runner for the Heisman Trophy, was unable to achieve a last-minute rescue of the Bruins. He threw four incomplete passes from the Washington State 6-yard line in the closing 35 seconds. His only other interception of the game came with less than two minutes to go as U.C.L.A. moved toward a possible winning touchdown. Cougars Score Early Washington State (5-3), which trailed by 21 points early in the third period, outscored the Bruins, 28-3, in the second half. Rick Swinton went 1 yard for the winning touchdown with 6 minutes 21 seconds to go in the game as the Cougars drove 80 yards on 13 running plays. Tim Rosenbach, the Cougars' quarterback, directed this come-from-behind effort and may have remained No. 1 in the nation in passing efficiency. Aikman had been No. 2.

Advertisement But that kind of upset is not unusual in the Pac-10. It seems that every year, some underdog throws a monkey wrench into the Rose Bowl prospects of one of the powers. Southern California (8-0), ranked first by The Times, is leading the league race for the Rose Bowl after its easy 41-20 victory over Oregon State. The Trojans must meet U.C.L.A. Nov. 19. Rodney Peete, the Trojans' quarterback, threw three touchdown passes in victory. He may move at least even with Aikman in the Heisman race. Peete had been considered second to his crosstown rival. Harris Leads Mountaineers Harris, the West Virginia junior quarterback, put himself in the Heisman battle as he ran and passed the Mountaineers to a record score over Penn State (4-4). W.V.U. scored the most points against the Nittany Lions since Joe Paterno became head coach in 1966. The game was marred by unruly fans during the final minute as thousands stormed onto the field with 49 seconds left. The teams left the field when it became impossible to complete the game.

Paterno was angry and showed it as he took his squad to the dressing room. This wasn't the first time West Virginia fans had misbehaved at a big victory over Penn State. Mountaineer followers did the same thing four years ago with 35 seconds to go during a 17-14 triumph here. Both teams retreated to the safety of the dressing rooms without completing that game. Notre Dame Moves Up Notre Dame (8-0) will probably move to second place in the Times ranking and to the top spot in the news agency polls, replacing U.C.L.A. But the Irish, who beat Navy, 22-7, in Baltimore, did not look like the best team in the nation in the victory. They played sloppy ball, and Coach Lou Holtz benched his starting quarterback, Tony Rice, during part of the first half because things were going so poorly. Where West Virginia, seventh in the polls and 10th in the Times ranking, will be this week is anyone's guess. It should be at least third in the polls, but will probably be fourth behind Miami (6-1). Nebraska (8-1) was ranked above West Virginia, as was Miami. But West Virginia's explosive first half, in which it went ahead, 41-8, could have been impressive enough to lift the Mountaineers over the Hurricanes, who played a soft opponent. The Cornhuskers did not look very impressive in struggling from behind on their own turf to beat Missouri, 26-18. Advertisement Steve Walsh, Miami's quarterback, had his fourth straight game with at least four touchdown passes as he tossed for four scores again to beat East Carolina, 31-7. In another of his many superb efforts this season, Barry Sanders of Oklahoma State (6-1) easily remained the nation's leader in rushing as he went 320 yards in the Cowboys' 45-27 victory over Kansas State. Two almost forgotten unbeaten teams remained unbeaten and probably not much better known. One is Wyoming (9-0), which easily defeated Colorado State, 48-14, in a Western Athletic Conference game. The other is Arkansas (8-0). The Razorbacks did not perform as expected against Rice, a team that has not won a game this year. The Owls even led during the second half before Arkansas pulled it out, 21-14. The victory assured Arkansas the spot as the Southwest Conference host in the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 2.
