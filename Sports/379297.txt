The Red Bulls on Monday fired the assistant coaches Richie Williams and Des McAleenan, a surprising move in that it came less than three weeks before the team’s season opener. The statement announcing the decision offered little in the way of explanation. Here it is in its entirety: Red Bull New York announced today that it has relieved assistant coach Richie Williams and goalkeeping coach Des McAleenan of their duties effective immediately. âAs an organization, we decided to go a different direction with our coaching staff,â said Red Bull New York General Manager and Sporting Director Erik Soler. âWe want to thank Richie and Des for their contributions to our franchise and wish them good luck in their future endeavors.â The Red Bulls are in the midst of preseason training and open the season at home against Seattle on March 19. The loss of the two veteran coaches leaves Coach Hans Backe with only one fulltime assistant, the Norwegian Jan Halvor Halvorsen, who joined the team in January. Williams was entering his sixth season with the Red Bulls, and twice served as the team’s interim coach — in 2006 and 2009. (Soler had high praise for Williams’s ability when he signed him to a contract extension last March.)  McAleenan goes back even further with the club; he joined the franchise in 2001, when it was called the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, and served under seven head coaches.
