Advertisement  When the cat that disrupted the Athletics-Yankees game in the Oakland Coliseum last Monday night finally made a departure after darting around the outfield and trying to hop the backstop behind home plate, it chose the right exit. It made a mad dash for Oakland's dugout, where, it turned out, a benefactor wearing an A's uniform was waiting. Tony La Russa, manager of the A's, is an animal-rights activist, and after learning that the cat had been taken to a local pound, he sent a clubhouse worker to retrieve it and transfer it to a feline clinic in Walnut Creek, Calif. On Thursday, La Russa, wearing a T-shirt reading ''Please spay and neuter your pets,'' paid a visit to the newly spayed cat at the clinic. ''Something like this goes on all the time and nobody knows about it,'' he said. La Russa, who has four cats and two dogs at home, stopped short of adopting the coliseum cat, but he did give it a name, Evie, in honor of Evie Haas, the wife of Walter Haas, owner of the A's. A local cat-lovers organization is trying to find Evie a permanent home, preferably one with an outfield-size yard, but Evie just might prefer a return to her previous domicile. It seems that a colony of cats calls the coliseum home, generally keeping out of sight during games and emerging afterward to feast on the rich pickings of food leftovers.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
