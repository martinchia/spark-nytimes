 France truly blitzed Switzerland â midfielders, forwards, wing backs all surging downfield together. Winning 5-2, the French got their five goals from five different players: Olivier Giroud, Blaise Matuidi, Mathieu Valbuena, Karim Benzema and Moussa Sissoko.  The Swiss had moments of possession, but they did seem like mere moments.  In the final 10 minutes of the game, Switzerland managed to score two goals â by Blerim Dzemaili and Granit Xhaka â which will help them if goal difference becomes a factor in deciding who goes through to the next round.  But they shouldnât need that. Their final opponent is Honduras, and if the Swiss win that game, they are likely to be safe.  France, now on top of the group with 6 points from two games, only need to tie Ecuador in their final match, next Wednesday, to get through.  An optimistic omen for the French is that the last time they won their two opening games (as theyâve done here) was in 1998 â and they went on to win the whole tournament, in Paris.  Although no European team has ever won the World Cup in South America, France looks like a fine candidate to try to be the first. Almost from the re-start, Benzema picks off an errant back pass by Valon Behrami in midfield, and sends a long diagonal ball to Matuidi, who shoots immediately and tucks it inside the near post.     My compliments to Matuidi for the goal but Benaglio should never have let himself be beaten to the near post from that angle — Christopher Clarey (@christophclarey) June 20, 2014  This  began with a Swiss corner kick, which Raphael Varane quickly relays out to Giroud on the left wing — Giroud made a lung-busting run all the way downfield and into the area, where he sent a simple cross to Valbuena, who tapped it in. Nothing Benaglio could do.      The French need to practice their goal celebrations. Riding piggyback and sticking your tongue out is just so minor league. France 3-0. — Juliet Macur (@JulietMacur) June 20, 2014

 Switzerland was much buzzed-about coming into the Cup, and after an initial struggle, it rallied to beat Ecuador. But the game was physical and frenetic in the heat; will these players have the energy for a better France team? France should be well rested, as it romped past Honduras in a mismatch. Its real test begins here. Both teams have a victory; the winner here will advance, but the loser won't be dead. Advertisement
