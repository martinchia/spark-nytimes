Advertisement By GERALD ESKENAZI With his flowing hair, clever moves and good looks, RON DUGUAY was a Ranger hero of another era. But now, at age 35, and 10 years removed from his 40-goal season with the New Yorkers, Duguay is attempting a comeback. He starts skating on Sept. 11, the oldest player trying out for the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning. Duguay hasn't been in the National Hockey League since the 1988-89 season, when he played with the Los Angeles Kings. He then spent a year in West Germany, and he played the last two seasons with the San Diego Gulls of the International League. The Lightning's president and general manager is PHIL ESPOSITO, who was a Duguay teammate on the Rangers in the late 1970's. In another respect, it will be like old times for Duguay. He will not wear a helmet. League rules now permit anyone to play without the protective headgear. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
