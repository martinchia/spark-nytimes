Advertisement  AP Zane Smith threw the Pittsburgh Pirates' second one-hitter in three days in a 6-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals tonight. Smith's one-hitter came two days after Doug Drabek one-hit the Cardinals in an 8-0 victory. It was the second one-hitter of Smith's career and second in 20 starts with the Pirates. He held the Mets to one hit last Sept. 5. It also gave the Pirates their first three-game sweep of the Cardinals at Busch Stadium on their first visit since clinching the National League East title Sept. 30. They have won 6 straight and 9 of their last 10 in St. Louis. Smith (7-2) won for the fifth time in six starts and lowered his earned run average to 2.19. The only hit he allowed was a one-out triple in the third by Jose Oquendo, who snapped an 0-for-30 slump when his shallow fly ball fell between second baseman Jose Lind and right fielder Mitch Webster. Twins 9, Rangers 1 Advertisement ARLINGTON, Tex. (AP) -- Nolan Ryan wasn't sharp in his return from the disabled list and not good enough to beat Jack Morris, who pitched a four-hitter as Minnesota beat Texas. Advertisement A three-run homer by Greg Gagne, who had four r.b.i., was the big hit off Ryan (3-4), who was pitching for the first time since straining a shoulder muscle on May 13. Ryan went four innings, allowed five runs on five hits, struck out four and walked one. Morris (5-5) has won five of his last six decisions after an 0-3 start. He struck out a season-high eight and walked two in his third complete game. The loss was the second straight for Texas, which had won 14 straight before being shut out, 3-0, Tuesday night. Ryan's earned run average jumped from 2.94 to 3.56. The 44-year-old right-hander, who pitched his seventh career no-hitter on May 1, missed two starts while on the disabled list. Angels 8, White Sox 4 CHICAGO (AP) -- Chuck Finley became the first American League pitcher to win eight games, and hot-hitting Dave Winfield led California's 15-hit attack as the Angels beat an error-prone Chicago. Wally Joyner had the tie-breaking r.b.i. in California's six-run sixth inning, during which the White Sox committed two of their four errors. Winfield was 3 for 5 with his eighth homer. He has 8 hits in his last 11 times at bat and has hit two homers in two nights at Comiskey Park. Finley (8-2) survived a four-run Chicago fourth to beat Greg Hibbard (3-3). Finley gave up 10 hits in six and one-third innings, striking out 9 and walking 2. Phillies 2, Expos 1 Advertisement PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Charlie Hayes, who earlier snapped an 0-for-31 streak, led off the eighth inning with a home run to give Philadelphia the victory.

Willie McGee drove in three runs with two hits for the Giants. Mariners 8, Royals 0 SEATTLE (AP) -- Brian Holman pitched a four-hitter and Pete O'Brien homered as Seattle ended a seven-game losing streak.

The Royals had their four-game winning streak snapped. The Mariners broke open a 2-0 game by sending 11 batters to the plate in a six-run seventh against Storm Davis. The loss was just the second in six games for the Royals under Hal McRae, their new manager. Holman (2-2) pitched his second shutout of the season and the fifth of his career.
