Advertisement By TIMOTHY W. SMITH The Jets are playing a waiting game with the contract offers they have extended to quarterback Steve DeBerg, an unrestricted free agent from Miami, and kick returner Brian Mitchell, an unrestricted free agent from the Redskins. The Jets would not divulge the terms of the offers they have made to DeBerg and Mitchell. DeBerg, who started last season with Tampa Bay and finished with Miami, is also negotiating with the Dolphins. Jets General Manager Dick Steinberg said that the DeBerg deal, if it is done, will not be a "heavy deal" that will adversely affect the team's salary-cap situation. "I would say that both teams are close to what he's looking for in terms of a team," said Jack Childers, DeBerg's agent, referring to the Jets and the Dolphins. "He feels that both teams have an equal possibility of making the playoffs. And as far as winning games, both teams are the same. He has high regard for both Dan Marino and Boomer Esiason." An Offer to Nagle If the Jets sign DeBerg, Browning Nagle, the backup to Esiason last year, will have little leverage to negotiate a new deal. The Jets have already made Nagle, a restricted free agent, a qualifying offer of $825,000 in order to retain his rights. If they sign him it will be for considerably less money. Or they might even cut him. The Jets have been looking to trade Nagle, but they have not received any offers. Advertisement Leigh Steinberg, the agent for Nagle, said the quarterback wanted to return to New York. "His stance is that he wants to start for the New York Jets," Steinberg said. "Is he contented being a backup with the Jets? No. Does he consider that his best option at the moment? Yes." DeBerg the Backup? Advertisement Dick Steinberg said that even if they signed DeBerg, it would not necessarily mean that Nagle would be expendable, although DeBerg will be the backup to Esiason. "We've said all along that we've got to get Nagle signed," Steinberg said. "The reason we went with the DeBerg thing was because we weren't sure that we'd be able to sign Nagle."

Another client of Leigh Steinberg, guard Dave Cadigan, is getting ready to jump into the free agent market. Cadigan, the Jets' starting left guard the last four seasons, is planning to visit teams beginning next week. Steinberg would not divulge Cadigan's itinerary. Cadigan had scheduled a visit to Cincinnati, where the former Jets coach Bruce Coslet is now the offensive coordinator. But he canceled that visit.                    --------------------       Giants Replace Kratch Bob Kratch is in New England and the Giants did not waste much time finding a replacement. Yesterday, the club came to terms with the former Phoenix guard Lance Smith. Smith, 6 feet 3 inches and 285 pounds, agreed to a three-year deal worth a total of about $4.5 million. He is entering his 10th season. When Kratch left the Giants to join his former coach, Bill Parcells, the Giants lost one of the hardest-working and most respected players on the team. By getting Smith, the right guard spot regains some of the work ethic that Kratch took with him. Smith is considered a blue-collar, tireless worker who has started 113 consecutive games with Phoenix. Smith played for the Giants' offensive line coach, Pete Managurian, at Louisiana State University. In regard to another Giants offensive lineman, tackle Doug Riesenberg, the team continues to negotiate with the player's agent, Leigh Steinberg. Yesterday Steinberg said Riesenberg insisted on staying with the Giants and was no longer interested in negotiating with Tampa Bay. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
