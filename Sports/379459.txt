General Manager Brian Cashman was engaging in some banter near the Yankeesâ dugout before Friday nightâs game against the Tampa Bay Rays when reporters approached him to ask about the teamâs pending decision on the starting rotation. Cashman obliged by launching into a spirited defense of A. J. Burnett, the high-priced, often disappointing starter for the Yankees who lately has found himself nominated to be the odd man out in a rotation that is about to go from six pitchers to five. Those nominations are being made by members of the news media and sports talk radio callers, and Cashman, who over the last year has become increasingly blunt in his comments, made it clear he was not amused by any of it. âHeâs being treated differently publicly because he has money attached,â said Cashman, who spiced his remarks with a profanity. âSo forgive him for saying yes to a contract. If you want to blame someone for his contract, blame me. But the man can still pitch.â  Burnett, who signed a five-year, $82.5 million deal before the 2009 season, has had a very uneven time in the Bronx. Though he helped the Yankees win the World Series in 2009, he has often struggled since then. He is 8-9 this season with a 4.60 earned run average and has not won a game since June 29. But Burnett, 34, is a veteran pitcher with the potential to be dominating at times, and, as Cashman implied but did not state, is unlikely to be removed from the Yankeesâ rotation. âI think the stuff on A. J. is well overblown,â Cashman said. âA. J. has been solid for us this year. I just think that the way itâs playing doesnât necessarily reflect how heâs pitched. The public outcry recently is all emotion rather than actual.â The Yankees are planning to trim their starting rotation to five before they embark on Monday for a seven-game road trip, which starts in Kansas City and then goes to Minnesota.
Phil Hughes is scheduled to start on Sunday, Freddy Garcia on Sunday and then Burnett on Monday. Hughes might be the one to end up out of the rotation when the adjustment is made. For one thing, Hughes did well as a reliever in 2009, when he went 5-1 with a 1.40 earned run average. Since July 1, Burnett is 0-3 with a 6.00 earned run average over seven starts. The low point came against the Chicago White Sox on Aug. 3, when Burnett gave up 7 runs and 13 hits in four and one-third innings, squandering some, but not all, of an enormous lead the Yankees had taken in the game. âI havenât exactly put it all together,â Burnett said after being told of Cashmanâs supportive comments. As for the Yankee fans who have turned on him and booed him at times, he said: âThey want me to be better. I make a lot of money. I have a big contract, so itâs only fair nature.â GIRARDI DEFENDS RIVERA  Andy Pettitte has retired. Jorge Posada is now riding the bench. Derek Jeter is still the starting shortstop but no longer the hitter he once was. The one Yankee pillar who has seemed insulated from the reality of getting older has been Mariano Rivera, but now even he looks vulnerable. The 41-year-old Rivera has struggled in his last three outings, setting off all sorts of alarms. But Yankee Manager Joe Girardi is having none of it, maintaining that Riveraâs bad week simply reflected the nature of the game. âIt happens to everyone,â Girardi said. âItâs the game of baseball. Mo has been so close to being automatic that when he has a blip, itâs more of a news story than someone else.â Rivera blew a save against the Boston Red Sox on Sunday, and then struggled in two games against the Los Angeles Angeles, giving up a two-run home run in a loss on Tuesday and making a shaky save on Thursday in which he first surrendered a three-run homer. âI think people, when players are older, are always looking for a sign,â Girardi said. âAnd thereâs too many times that that sign is not there yet, but theyâre looking hard for it.â SABATHIA FACES PRICE C. C. Sabathia has become accustomed to pitching against the Rays since he came to the Yankees for the 2009 season. And he has become particularly familiar with facing David Price. With his start on Friday, Sabathia has now pitched against the Rays 12 times since he joined the Yankees, and he has opposed Price in five of those games. Sabathia had not always done well in those matchups. Price won two of their earlier games, and neither pitcher was credited with a win or loss in the other two. Alex Rodriguez hit a solo home run in his first at-bat as the designated hitter for the Class A Tampa Yankees on Friday in a game in Dunedin, Fla., against the affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays. Rodriguez is scheduled to play third base on Saturday and could join Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Tuesday. Rodriguez, who is recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his right knee last month, could then rejoin the Yankees later next week.
