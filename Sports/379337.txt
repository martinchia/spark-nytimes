Advertisement By ROBIN FINN Ivan Lendl, who for three years has kept a dual grip on the United States Open and the top ranking in the world, fended off a lopsided attack yesterday from the tournament's most fashionable challenger, Andre Agassi, and advanced to the men's final today. Agassi, who kept his shorts-tossing and crowd-pleasing antics to a minimum, suffered his first defeat in 23 matches as Lendl survived a slow start to emerge the victor, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4. ''It's the Grand Slams that matter,'' said Lendl, who was clearly unimpressed by the record and unmoved by the plight of the youngest player to reach the men's semifinal here. ''I didn't come here to beat Agassi. I came to win the tournament.'' Lendl, who has won the Open for the last three years and has advanced to the final for seven consecutive years, will have a rematch with Mats Wilander today. Advertisement Wilander defeated the unseeded Darren Cahill of Australia, 6-4, 6-4, 6-2, in the first semifinal match yesterday. Advertisement Lendl defeated Wilander in five sets in the 1987 Open final in a match that became an endurance test and took a record 4 hours 47 minutes. Lendl's bid to become the first player since Bill Tilden (1920-25) to hold four consecutive titles and his chance to retain his No. 1 ranking depends on the outcome of today's match against Wilander, a player Lendl has beaten in their last six meetings. ''If I lose I can't be No. 1 anymore; if I win, I think I have a good chance,'' said Lendl, who was in a contrary mood during the first set of yesterday's 2-hour-37-minute match. He complained about Agassi's tendency to overdramatize his shotmaking, and the 18-year-old was reprimanded by the chair umpire for an overabundance of grunting. ''I don't think he has any idea how disturbing it is; I like hearing what the other guy is doing with the ball,'' said the 28-year-old Lendl, who also was skeptical of Agassi's tenacity in the middle sets of the match. ''It was almost like he gave those sets away.'' The top-seeded Lendl was oddly tentative in the first set, and Agassi, who has been the darling of the tournament as he endeared himself to the crowd while playing ruthlessly against all opponents, took full advantage. Cannonlike Forehand Agassi used his cross-court forehand like a cannon, and the balls whizzed out of Lendl's range before he even positioned himself to play them. Lendl's serve, arguably his best weapon, didn't disturb Agassi in the opening set. Agassi broke Lendl twice in the first set and seemed to take a commanding lead in the match, but Agassi's 6-4 dominance in the first set proved deceptive. ''What happened to me? Not enough,'' Agassi said. ''The key thing was to get on top early, and I did that in the first, but not in the rest. I was disappointed in my efforts. I didn't feel like I did against anybody else.'' As Lendl's play grew more consistent, Agassi began to get distracted. Lendl broke him twice in the second set, three times in the third, and broke him in the last game of the match for a finale. Advertisement Once he fell behind, the pace dropped off Agassi's blazing groundstrokes and his discouragement became visible in his play. When Lendl allowed him some leeway, Agassi over-extended himself and attempted winners on every shot. ''I just lost that early break,'' said Agassi, who after 22 straight victories had become unfamiliar with coping with deficits. ''And once he gets up on you it's hard to stop him.''

Agassi felt Lendl was being overbearing when he complained about his grunting, but he didn't deny that the Open's defending champion taught him a lesson about resilience on the stadium court. ''The reason he deserves to be No. 1 in the world is simply that he has a lot of strength, he's faster than most players, he always gets to the ball and he's always prepared,'' said Agassi, who deflated quickly in the second set, where Lendl reacted to losing the first set by breaking him. ''It's tough to get him on the run, on the defensive.'' 'Reaching for Anything' Agassi said the reason his game looked so disorganized in the middle sets was because it was. ''I was reaching for anything, to be honest,'' he said. He recovered a portion of his equilibrium in the fourth set, where he kept apace with Lendl until the final game. He served at 40-0, lost four straight points, and fell victim to a stream of backhands by Lendl that forced him to make an error on the last shot of the match. He swung his forehand wide, and Lendl stalked to the net for an obligatory handshake. Lendl said he wasn't bothered by the crowd's coolness toward him. ''I would have to be crazy to expect something else,'' he said, alluding to Agassi's matinee idol persona. Lendl said he wasn't sure if he would regain the support of fans in his adopted country in time for the final against Wilander. ''That depends on how much they don't like me for beating Andre,'' he said. Besides his desire for a rematch against Lendl, Wilander was inspired by the knowledge that an Open triumph would give him top-ranking in the world, a position Lendl has guarded for the last three years. Wilander was the winner of the French and Australian Opens this year while Lendl has yet to win a Slam in 1988. Wilander insisted he hadn't been thinking about his proximity to the top ranking, ''But it happens that if I win the U.S. Open, that's where I'm going to be.'' Advertisement Wilander never attempted to overwhelm the 33d-ranked Cahill, whom he hadn't played before. Instead, he used a steady if unspectacular array of forehand passing shots and a service return that failed so rarely it seemed almost automatic. ''In the match today there was no reason for me to try and take any risks,'' said Wilander. Wilander broke Cahill, a player reliant on a serve-and-volley game, nine times and lost his serve five times. ''The match was a combination of his good play and my not serving so well,'' said the 22-year-old Cahill. ''He didn't miss virtually anything. His pressure on my serve made my serve collapse.'' Wilander said he felt amply prepared for the final, and said he intended to be more aggressive. However he politely refused to disclose the mixed bag of shots he expected to use to counteract Lendl's power. ''That's my secret,'' he said.
