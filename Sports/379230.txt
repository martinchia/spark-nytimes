Advertisement  After a 13-year journey that took them to the Supreme Court, Jerry Tarkanian and Nevada-Las Vegas are about to end the longest-running case in National Collegiate Athletic Association history. The association's six-member infractions committee -minus one person - will hear the school's final presentation today. A decision is not expected for two to three weeks. But if the committee follows the recommendation of the N.C.A.A.'s executive director, Dick Schultz, it will deal kindly with the man who coached the Runnin' Rebels this spring to their first national championship after being ordered in 1977 to serve a two-year suspension. Protected by a state court injunction, Tarkanian never served a day of the suspension. And the N.C.A.A., stymied by the legal roadblock, never again asked a school to suspend a coach. When the Supreme Court ruled, 5-4, against Tarkanian in December 1988, Schultz said he saw no need to pursue further punishment. The Supreme Court's ruling said the N.C.A.A., as a private organization, did not have to respect Tarkanian's constiutional right to due process if it ordered another suspension. But at the same time, the court said the school does have to obey due process.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
