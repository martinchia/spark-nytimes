CHICAGO â Ken Williams, the general manager of the Chicago White Sox, was at Candlestick Park in San Francisco for the N.F.C. championship game to watch his son, Kyle, a 49ers receiver, play in the biggest football game of his life. Williams watched through the rain as his son mishandled two punt returns. The second, a fumble in overtime, propelled the Giants to the Super Bowl. Williamsâs first words to his son were. âAre you tough enough to handle this?â âHe said, âAbsolutely,â â Williams said. Kyle, 23, addressed his mistakes publicly, and head on. âEverybody is responsible for what they do on the field,â he said the day after the game. âItâs something that I was responsible for and I made a mistake, and itâs time to own up to it and move forward.â One weekend later, his father was back in Chicago to face his own interrogation at the annual White Sox fan convention. Williams was grilled about last yearâs third-place finish, despite a franchise-record $127 million payroll, followed by what has been perceived as a lackluster off-season. He later received a handful of boos from disgruntled hometown fans. âI have broad shoulders, Iâll take it,â Williams said of the fansâ ire. Ken Williams is the fifth longest tenured general manager in baseball, hired by the White Sox in 2000. He has been through the high of a World Series championship in 2005 to the low of last yearâs deterioration of his relationship with the fan favorite manager, Ozzie Guillen, who resigned to take the Miami Marlins job in September. After everything Williams has been through personally and professionally during his sonâs formative years, he said Kyle is well equipped to handle life in the public eye â both the good and the bad. âHeâs seen my mail,â Williams said. âI have firsthand knowledge of what itâs like. He grew up in a house where it was discussed and talked about what to expect.â Since the 49ersâ loss, Kyle has been the target of abuse on Twitter, including death threats. His father, too, is no stranger to the deeply personal attacks that can fly in 140-character bursts. In one instance, Williams, an African-American, drafted an African-American outfielder in the first round of last yearâs amateur draft. Guillenâs son Oney tweeted: âShocker the white sox pick another good athletic black kid. how about picking a good baseball player.â âKenny is a strong individual,â the longtime White Sox broadcaster Ken Harrelson said. âFor everything he goes through here, he has to be.â While Kyle can now look forward to an off-season of rest and rejuvenation, Williams is set to embark on what could be a long season on the South Side. Robin Ventura, Guillenâs replacement, has no managerial experience at any level. Two of Williamsâs most expensive gambles, Alex Rios and Adam Dunn, will still be everyday players. The two sluggers combined for 24 home runs andÂ  batted .227 and .159 last year and together will make $26.5 million in 2012. The veteran starting pitcher and model of consistency Mark Buehrle followed Guillen to Miami in free agency. The only general manager to win a World Series in Chicago in 188 seasons will also now be measured against the two-time World Series champion architect Theo Epstein, hired by the crosstown Cubs in October. âIâd put Kennyâs 10-year record up against just about anyone,â said Harrelson, striking an optimistic tone. âKenny isnât afraid to answer his critics, you saw that with Kyle, too.â Williams found it difficult to articulate the parallels between the emotions of facing his own detractors and watching his son face his. He was confident of one thing, though: his sonâs mettle. âHe stood up in front of more media than I ever have and told them exactly how he felt,â Williams said, surrounded by a scrum of local reporters. âItâs affirmation of the character he has and also a lesson in how you carry yourself in our family.â Then Williams went back to answering questions about this yearâs undermanned White Sox team, but with the hint of a smile.
