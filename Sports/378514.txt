Advertisement By SANDRA BAILEY and  The United States men's volleyball team, those guys with the chips on their shoulders and the stubble on their heads, have been talking for most of these Olympics about fighting the power. They finally got their chance tonight and came out swinging. And it wasn't the $1-million-a-year professional Steve Timmons or the loud and proud reserve Bob Samuelson who came through. It was Brent Hilliard, a senior to be at Long Beach State University, who served the final ball that could not be handled, giving the United States a 9-15, 16-14, 15-11, 15-13 upset of Italy, the defending World Cup champion and the gold- medal favorite. "It's one of those things you always look forward to when you are not a starter," said Hilliard, a 22-year-old playing in his first Olympics. The team spokesman, Rich Wanninger, called it "a message game," and indeed it had no bearing on the rest of the Olympics, at least not officially. The United States had already clinched a spot in the quarterfinals, where it will meet the Unified Team, and Italy came in undefeated and knowing that the Netherlands would be next up on Wednesday. The other quarterfinalists -- Spain, Brazil, Japan and Cuba -- had also already been set.

Advertisement "We got a lot of guys in the match," Timmons said, "and we got Bryan Ivie back." Ivie, a middle blocker, went out in the team's opener against Japan with a knee injury and had not played until he came off the bench in the second set tonight.
