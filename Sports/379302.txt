 Skier Tim Durtschi garnered attention for his exploits in ski resort terrain parks and jumps in the backcountry. But he has stepped away from manicured features to ski natural terrain. “Behind the Line” is a video series produced by Teton Gravity Research that takes you into the minds of skiers. In each episode, the athletes will look back on a line, a jump or a session, and discuss the moment. Throughout the past decade, Tim Durtschi garnered attention for his exploits in ski resort terrain parks and jumps in the backcountry. In the past few years, however, he has stepped away from manicured features to ski natural terrain. In this episode of “Behind the Line,” by Teton Gravity Research, Durtschi explores the Kootenays of British Columbia. Rather than applying his skills to man-made features, he turns the entire mountain into his canvas. After identifying a zone riddled with spines, Durtschi carefully studies the entrance to it. Despite having to drop into his line from a cornice and land on a narrow perch, he embraces the descent: a line that he considers to be one of the most challenging ones he skied last winter.
