NOTRE DAME AT MICHIGAN 8 p.m., ESPN There will be a mix of tradition and innovation when these storied programs play the first night game at Michigan Stadium. Both teams will be wearing throwback uniforms, and the atmosphere promises to be electric (despite the fact that neither team is ranked). There were big expectations at Notre Dame coming into the season, but the Irish find themselves staring at the possibility of an 0-2 start, which would put pressure on the second-year coach Brian Kelly. Michiganâs defense has been maligned over the past couple of seasons and looked shaky early last week before improving in the second half of a weather-shortened victory over Western Michigan. Wolverines quarterback Denard Robinson had 502 yards of offense against the Irish in last seasonâs victory and is one of the most exciting players in the nation. Kelly benched quarterback Dayne Crist last week in favor of the sophomore Tommy Rees, who will start this week.  NO. 3 ALABAMA AT NO. 23 PENN STATE  3:30 p.m., ABC The only matchup of ranked opponents this weekend features two teams that rotated quarterbacks last week and will probably do so again. Alabamaâs duo â A. J. McCarron and Phillip Sims â each threw two interceptions last week, while neither of Penn Stateâs quarterbacks â Matt McGloin and Rob Bolden â looked impressive against Indiana State of the Football Championship Subdivision. The question is whether Penn State will be able to move the ball against Alabamaâs defense, which is one of the best in the country, and whether the Nittany Lions will be able to stop a tough Crimson Tide running game led by Trent Richardson, left. Alabama is the favorite and could stop Penn Stateâs 23-game nonconference winning streak at home. NO. 25 TEXAS CHRISTIAN AT AIR FORCE  3:30 p.m., Versus  After going 13-0 last season, the Horned Frogs look to avoid an 0-2 start.  NO. 12 SOUTH CAROLINA AT GEORGIA 4:30 p.m., ESPN The senior quarterback Stephen Garcia came off the bench last week to help the Gamecocks rally to beat East Carolina and will get the start against the Bulldogs. Georgia fans have been grumbling about Coach Mark Richt, and a loss certainly would not silence his critics. South Carolina running back Marcus Lattimore and receiver Alshon Jeffery are two breathtaking talents, and the Gamecocks are capable of scoring plenty of points.   UTAH AT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  7:30 p.m., Versus The Utes, in their first season in the Pacific-12, are one of the favorites in the South Division, in part because the Trojans are barred from the postseason.  NO. 16 MISSISSIPPI STATE AT AUBURN 12 p.m., SEC Network The defending national champion Tigers are a 7-point underdog at home.
