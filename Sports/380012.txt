Advertisement  Of the Giants' three unsigned veterans, William Roberts will probably join the team Monday and Dave Meggett anywhere between Monday and Wednesday. Mark Ingram's negotiations have reached an impasse. A source with knowledge of the negotiations said today that negotiations had all but concluded with Roberts, an eighth-year offensive guard. The source said Roberts would sign a three-year contract worth $2.45 million. He would get annual salaries of $750,000, $800,000 and $850,000, with a $50,000 signing bonus. But Roberts was said to be trying for $900,000 in 1993. Last year, Roberts earned $430,000. In his first two seasons, Meggett earned base salaries of $75,000 and $90,000. He had been seeking $1.7 million over two years. Ingram, a fifth-year wide receiver, earned $250,000 last year. The Giants have offered $500,000 this year and $550,000 next year, a $25,000 bonus and heavy, reachable incentives. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
