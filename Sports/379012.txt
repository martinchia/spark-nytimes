The news that the United States will send more women than men to compete on its Olympic team in London reflects a turnaround in womenâs participation in the modern Games thatâs evolved over the past century.  The 530-member U.S. Olympic team is comprised of 269 women and 261 men, spanning 25 different sports.  In 2008, the U.S. sent 306 men and 282 women to Beijing (588 total) and 279 men and 254 women (533 total) went to Athens, according to the International Society of Olympic Historians. In 2000, 332 men went to Sydney and 253 women for a total of 586 athletes.  Women also represent both ends of the age spectrum of the U.S. 2012 team. Karen OâConnor, a 54-year-old equestrian, will be the oldest member of the team, and swimmer Katie Ledecky, 15, is the youngest. (The average age for the team is 27, according to the U.S.O.C.) There are 54 dads and 13 moms on the team.

At Olympics in the past, the ratio of women has been lower. At the 2008 Beijing Games, out of the 11,196 athletes, 4,746 were women, a record 42 percent, according to the International Olympic Committee.  At the 1960 Games in Rome, only 611 women competed, representing just 11.5 percent of the athletes. This year, Saudi Arabia is including women on its Olympic team for the first time, one of only a handful of delegations that has resisted sending females. The presence of women at the elite international level is certainly a departure from the ancient Olympic Games, which were reserved entirely for men. Women first competed at the Olympics at the 1900 Paris Games in lawn tennis and golf. In 1928, gymnastics and track were added, expanding opportunities for women, but distance running events over 200 meters were eliminated in 1960, due to unconfirmed reports that women collapsed after running a longer race, according to Olympic historian Bill Mallon.   âThey simply looked tired,â Mallon said. âBut in that era, that was unacceptable to the I.O.C. honchos.â  The women runners who remained often bore the brunt of budget cuts. In 1936, the American Olympic Committee faced a deficit and âruthlessly slashedâ the womenâs track team from 17 to four athletes, according to The Times on July 6, 1936.  âIt all resolved down to the point where many athletes will have to pay their own way, in part or in full, if they expect to compete in the Olympics.â Five days later, The Times reported that âsome of the girls who qualified for the team are virtually stranded in New York and are on the verge of hunger.â  Only 76 years later, they’re the majority. Quanitta Underwood, perhaps Americaâs best hope for a medal in womenâs boxing at the Olympics, lived through a horrific ordeal as a child.  The gold medalist Rulon Gardner is 40 years old and overweight, but he believes that he can qualify to wrestle at the Summer Games.
