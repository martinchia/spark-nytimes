Advertisement  Three of Germany's top track stars, including the double world sprint champion, Katrin Krabbe, were suspended from competition on suspicion of drug use yesterday, not because they tested positive for banned substances but because they did not. In a strange twist, the athletes were suspended pending further investigation by German track authorities after chemical analyses of urine samples provided by the three women last month found no trace of illicit substances but indicated such a strikingly similar chemical composition as to suggest that the samples had come from the same person. The authorities said that follow-up tests could be completed and the issue resolved as early as today. The other suspended athletes are Grit Breuer, who placed second in the 400 meters at Tokyo, and Silke Moller, a former world champion in the 100 meters.
