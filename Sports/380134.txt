Advertisement  Milwaukee Bucks forward FRANK BRICKOWSKI pleaded guilty Friday to a Federal charge of possessing an ounce of marijuana, which authorities said was delivered to his Montana ranch last September. Brickowski, 32, appeared before U.S. Magistrate BART ERICKSON in Missoula, and cursed a news photographer who took his picture outside the building. Prosecutors recommended Brickowski pay a $1,000 fine and serve no jail time. Sentencing is scheduled for May 18 in Missoula. N.B.A. players who are convicted of, or plead guilty to, a crime involving the use or distribution of cocaine or heroin are banned from the league. A crime involving marijuana does not carry an automatic penalty.(AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives. Please send feedback, error reports,
