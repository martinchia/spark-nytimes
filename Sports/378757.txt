The five finalists for the Heisman Trophy, which will be awarded Saturday night in New York, constitute a field that has been as interesting, entertaining and accomplished as any in recent memory. There are two quarterbacks who lifted their programs, one almost single-handedly. There is a dynamic defensive player with a memorable nickname. There is a powerful running back on a team that will be playing in the national championship game. And then there is a statistical workhorse who quietly gained in prominence, even as many voters concentrated on one of his teammates. âItâs a nice mix of characters,â Chris Huston, who runs the Web site HeismanPundit.com, said in a telephone interview. âItâs great. Itâs everything you want in a Heisman race.â The finalists come from universities located across the country, and the presumptive favorite, Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III, only recently started to distance himself from the rest, meaning that the result is not a fait accompli, as it was last season, when Auburnâs Cam Newton won in a landslide. Here is a closer look at each of the finalists: Montee Ball
Wisconsin, junior running back Early in the season, it appeared that quarterback Russell Wilson might be representing Wisconsin at the Heisman ceremony, but Ballâs productivity has been overwhelming. His total of 38 touchdowns is one shy of the 39 Barry Sanders scored in 1988 to set a single-season record. Ball has also averaged 6.4 yards per carry. But he is largely considered the dark-horse candidate, perhaps in part because of Wilsonâs former prominence in the race. Wilsonâs campaign dropped off after the Badgersâ losses to Michigan State and Ohio State in late October. Robert Griffin III
Baylor, junior quarterback Griffin solidified himself as the leading Heisman contender last Saturday, when he led Baylor to a victory over Texas that gave the Bears their first nine-win season since 1986. A dynamic threat with his arm and his legs, Griffin has accounted for 45 touchdowns, and his 192.31 pass efficiency rating leads the nation. Griffin made a big impression on Heisman voters by leading Baylor over Texas Christian in the season opener, and through the first three games of the season, he had thrown more touchdown passes (13) than incompletions (12). That Griffin is a deanâs list student who hopes to attend law school could also earn him some good will among the voters. Andrew Luck
Stanford, senior quarterback After deciding to return to Stanford this season despite being projected as a high N.F.L. draft pick, Luck immediately became the Heisman favorite, a distinction he held for much of the year. But while Luck remains perhaps the top pro prospect in a generation, Stanfordâs lopsided loss to Oregon on Nov. 12 probably dimmed his chances. Luck, the runner-up for last yearâs Heisman, put up big numbers in leading the Cardinal to yet another strong season, throwing for 3,170 yards and 35 touchdowns and completing 70 percent of his passes. Stanford Coach David Shaw recently delivered a 30-minute PowerPoint presentation to the local news media that focused on why Luck deserved the award. Tyrann Mathieu
Louisiana State, sophomore cornerback Mathieu might be the most exciting player in the country. Known by the nickname Honey Badger, Mathieu is a ball-hawking playmaker for top-ranked L.S.U., and he can create as much of a spark with his play on special teams as with his defensive ability. Last Saturday, Mathieu returned a punt 62 yards for a touchdown to help propel the Tigers over Georgia in the Southeastern Conference championship game. He nearly scored on another return later in the game, a dazzling, zigzag run. Mathieuâs one-game suspension for violating team rules this season could hurt his chances. Trent Richardson
Alabama, junior running back Richardson has been a force all season. A compact and powerful runner, Richardson has proved to be nearly impossible for one defender to bring down. He racked up a 6.0 yards-per-carry average this season despite facing four teams that ranked in the top 20 in total defense. Richardson may get penalized by Heisman voters because Alabamaâs identity is largely built on its defense, not its offense. Nevertheless, Richardson has accounted for nearly 40 percent of the Crimson Tideâs total offense, finishing the regular season with 1,583 yards rushing and 23 touchdowns.
