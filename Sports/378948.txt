Advertisement By MICHAEL JANOFSKY HOW IT'S DONE: A relatively new Olympic sport, added to the program for the Seoul Games in 1988, table tennis -- please, not Ping-Pong -- includes four events: a singles and doubles tournament for men and women. More than 100 countries participate, with athletes competing through a round-robin format before the leading 16 singles players and eight doubles teams advance to a knockout tournament to determine the medal winners. Each match consists of three games to 21 points, and the winner must have a 2-point advantage. HOW TO WATCH: The game is played the way you remember it from your neighbor's basement. The difference is, these players are wonderfully skilled in varying the pace, direction and speed of each hit. The style of play is also remarkable for the way some players bash everything and others retrieve everything. WHO TO WATCH: When table tennis made its debut, players from Asian countries dominated. South Korea and China split the four gold medals. For men, the power curve has shifted toward Europe and Scandinavia, as two Swedes, Jorgen Persson and Jan-Ove Waldner, enter the Games as favorites in singles and doubles, along with a Frenchman, Jean-Phillipe Gatien, in singles. The women's power base remains in Asia, with the favorites Deng Yaping and Qiao Hong of China and Hyun Jung Hwa of South Korea. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
