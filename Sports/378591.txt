Advertisement  BOXING  Camacho Back on Right Side of the Ledger  Hector Camacho outpointed Pat Lawlor of Ireland in a 10-round welterweight bout last night in Bay St. Louis, Miss., for the three-time world champion's 47th career victory. Fighting at 153 pounds, the 32-year-old Camacho (47-3) won every round on two of the judges' cards and lost just one round on the other final card. Camacho knocked Lawlor (20-5) down in the first round with a straight left to the nose. Ranked 16th by the World Boxing Council, Camacho hopes to use his latest showing as a springboard to yet another title bid. Camacho lost earlier this year to Felix Trinidad, the International Boxing Federation welterweight champion.
