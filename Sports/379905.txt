Advertisement  There may be as much as $2.8 billion at stake, but to the Federal judge presiding over a lawsuit in Buffalo brought against New York State officials by former inmates of Attica prison, there are more important things to do today than to weigh evidence in the suit. It charges that the state's violent assault on the prison to end an inmate takeover in 1971 violated prisoners' rights. The jury began deliberations late last week, but Judge JOHN ELFVIN announced on Friday that there would be no deliberations today, which, not coincidentally, is when the Bills play the Denver Broncos for the American Football Conference championship. "I'm going to the game," he said. The judge has good reason to believe the jury will not chafe at the ruling. The day after the Bills' playoff victory over the Chiefs last week, the entire jury came to court wearing Bills jerseys. (AP) We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
