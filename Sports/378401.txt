ATLANTA â The Mets announced Monday that they signed the right-hander Aaron Harang to a minor league contract and assigned him to Class AAA Las Vegas. Harang, 35, made 22 starts for the Seattle Mariners this season, producing a 5-11 record and 5.76 earned run average over 120 1/3 innings. He has a 110-115 record over a 12-year major league career. Manager Terry Collins said the Mets needed a starter to work Sept. 14, when they play a doubleheader at home against the Miami Marlins.  Over all, Harang will provide some insurance to the rotation, which has been depleted through injury, and give the Mets an option if the rookie right-hander Zack Wheeler, who is on an innings limit, needs to be skipped or pushed back.     âI think weâve got to protect ourselves, with Zack and all the other guys,â Collins said.
