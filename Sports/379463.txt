With only one round complete in the junior championships, the rain has come at a particularly inopportune time, but all second-round matches are on the schedule for Wednesday, with no plans to move any matches indoors, as has been done in past years. If play starts, here are three matches to seek out. Jiri Vesely vs. Marcos Giron
Court 7, 11 a.m. Australian Open boys champion Vesely is the worldâs top-ranked junior, which assures him of the top seeding here in New York. The 6-foot-6 left-hander from the Czech Republic has a substantial height advantage over Giron, a Southern Californian who is about to begin his freshman year at U.C.L.A. Giron has the quickness advantage, however, and is extremely comfortable on hard courts, where his forehand and willingness to close the net are particularly effective.  He also reached the round of 16 at both the Wimbledon and Roland Garros junior championships this year, so this is a tough second round draw for the two 18-year-olds, who havenât played each other in nearly two years. If Giron returns well, he has an excellent chance for the upset. Alexios Halebian vs. Julien Lenz
Court 6, 11 a.m. Halebian, a 17-year-old from California who trains at the U.S.T.A.âs National Center in Boca Raton, had a good win in the first round, taking out No. 5 seed Thiago Monteiro in three sets, his second win over the Brazilian in the past 10 months. A lefthander who loves his drop shot, Halebian wonât wow you with his technique, but he has admirable competitive instincts. Lenz, an 18-year-old German, had a convincing win in the first round, which was only his second win in a junior slam this year. Nicole Gibbs v. Eugenie Bouchard
Court 7, afternoon This second round encounter between No. 4 seed Bouchard and qualifier Gibbs may appear to be a mismatch, but it most certainly is not. Gibbs, 18, spent a full season at Stanford University, where as a freshman she reached the semifinals of the N.C.A.A. womenâs individual tournament. The Ohio native played only one junior tournament this year, last monthâs U.S.T.A. National 18s Hard Courts, where she was a finalist for the second year in a row.  The 17-year-old Canadian has taken a different route, signing a professional contract several years ago, and she has had enough success in the I.T.F. womenâs circuit to move her W.T.A. ranking inside 400.
This match, which is their first meeting, is a toss-up, but with Gibbsâ reputation for gritty comebacks, donât assume itâs over before it actually is. Journalists from The New York Times and The International Herald Tribune (along with a few dedicated fans) are following the Grand Slam tournaments, on and off the court. They will provide updates, insights, links and analysis while setting the scene from the stands as well as the press room.
