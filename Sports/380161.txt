Collin Altamirano got a rough initiation into the world of pro tennis on Court 11 at the United States Open Tuesday. Altamirano, the 2013 wild card as the boys’ 18s national champion, lost, 6-1, 6-3, 6-1, in the opening round to 22nd-seeded Philipp Kohlschreiber in a one-sided affair that was more a lesson than a match. Altamirano won his opening service game to love and got to deuce on Kohlschreiberâs first service game thanks to back-to back double faults from the German, but once Kohlschreiber got out of that early jam he never felt the necessary pressure from the young American to make it interesting. Matches like these are a necessary rite of passage that separates the men from the boys, and Altamirano must focus more on the experience than the result as he shapes his junior game into a successful pro career.  Altamirano never got to break point in the match, won 26 percent of second-serve points, went to the net only four times and seemed more in a rush to make an error than to construct a strategy. These are all junior shortcomings that are exposed against a seasoned veteran, but four main areas stood out from Altamiranoâs game that need attention. The first is his court position. American juniors in general seem to have missed the memo that where you stand matters, and closer to the baseline is always better than closer to the fence. Altamirano willingly moved back too much, which made his ball shorter and pulled Kohlschreiber up to the baseline, giving his opponent better geometry of the court to attack. Altamirano spent too much of the match running side to side weaving around linesmen than hunting the short ball. He won four of four points coming forward to finish at the net, but itâs hard to win in the Big Apple from halfway up the back fence. Second was the ball. Altamirano has wonderful racket head speed but too much of that energy on his forehand is translated into spin, not power, and the effort goes unrewarded as his ball often sits âfatâ for his opponent to attack. Combine that with poor court position and you clearly understand how he managed only 10 winners for the match and coughed up 34 unforced errors (18 forehand/13 backhand) and 49 total errors. Third was his shot tolerance. Like most juniors, Altamirano displayed limited patience and he rushes to finish the point before it really starts. This is clearly illustrated by I.B.M. data that showed he won 37 percent (32/85) of rallies between 0 and 4 shots, 29 percent of rallies lasting 5 to 8 shots and 47 percent (9/19) of rallies that lasted past nine shots. If he just made four balls every point before trying to pull the trigger, then who knows what would have happened. Last was his body language. There will be a lot worse during the tournament, but his constant stream of negativity and how he held his head and shoulders was self-destructive. Do not turn up to be brilliant during a point if you are turning the sword against yourself between points. The match will be somewhat memorable for the fact that a squirrel ran on the court with Altamirano serving at deuce at 1-1 in the third set. Not your normal run of the mill occurrence at a Grand Slam. There is a good chance we will be hearing from this young man again as he improves and learns that what won him matches in juniors needs to evolve against people that do this for a living. Just the fact of staying around the baseline will directly translate into staying around the tournament a little longer.
