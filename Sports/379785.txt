Yankees Manager Joe Girardi hopes to know late Wednesday what, if anything, is wrong with pitcher Phil Hughes, who was scheduled for a second day of tests after having two magnetic resonance imaging tests and a blood-circulation test on his right arm Tuesday. âTheyâre going to try to rule out everything they possibly can,â Girardi said at a news conference at Yankee Stadium before his team played the White Sox. A day after he cut short a bullpen session Monday at Yankee Stadium after about 15 pitches, Hughes, 24, said he had nearly two hours of testing Tuesday at New York Presbyterian Hospital. Hughes said before Tuesdayâs game that he had not received any results. Hughes has experienced a loss in velocity on his pitches, which resulted in an 0-1 record and a 13.94 earned run average in his first three starts. He said his first five pitches Monday felt good, and his second five pitches were O.K., but âsomething just left after that.â He sat at his locker before batting practice Tuesday and said: âNobodyâs happy about it. Itâs frustrating. But once I didnât feel right after this, doing these tests was really the only other option in order to dig down deep and find out what was really going on.â Hughes, who has been on the disabled list since April 15, estimated that he could pitch at 85 percent of what he considered to be normal, but when he was asked if he could win pitching at 85 percent, he replied, âWhen youâre not taking your best stuff out there, itâs difficult.â  The 6-foot-5, 240-pound Hughes, who struck out 146 batters in 1761/3 innings while winning 18 games in the 2010 regular season, added, âWith my style, itâs a little more difficult to do that.â A minor league rehabilitation assignment that was to begin Thursday has been canceled, replaced with a consultation Monday with Chris Ahmad, the team physician, and three tests on Tuesday. Hughes said he had been told there is a chance that nothing is wrong with him medically. âIf they find something, they find something,â he said. âIâm just anxious to find out whatâs going on.â Girardi said he and his staff are conscious about not overworking their pitchers and pay close attention to detail. Still, Hughes pitched 90 more innings in 2010 than he did in 2009, which Girardi said might have had led to loss of velocity earlier this year. âEverybody is unique, and everybody is going to respond differently to different workloads,â Girardi said. âNo one can say that two bodies are alike. So what is going on with Phil, we may not see here for the next 20 years. We donât know why heâs having his issues, but weâre trying to find out.â SHUFFLING THE LINEUP Joe Girardi said Tuesday that he gave Alex Rodriguez the night off from playing third base â using him as a designated hitter instead â because he wants to âtry to be smartâ with how he uses veterans like Rodriguez and Derek Jeter. Girardi also said that he had noticed that the timing of another veteran, Jorge Posada, the teamâs regular designated hitter, seemed to be off. âAt times, heâs late on the fastballs and early on the off-speed pitches,â Girardi said. Posada, 39, had a .145 batting average after Mondayâs 2-0 loss to the White Sox. He had six home runs, one more than Rodriguez and one fewer than
Curtis Granderson, the team leader. But Posada has only three other hits, and he has struck out 19 times in 62 at-bats. Girardi also wanted to put the veteran Eric Chavez at third base because he was playing well as a reserve and displaying an admirable work ethic. The indoor batting cage is near the dugout at Yankee Stadium, and Girardi often hears Chavez taking cuts during a game. âThe last couple of years have helped him prepare for this,â Girardi said of the 33-year-old Chavez, who was limited in his last four years with Oakland because of injuries.
