Advertisement  AP Mark Calcavecchia won his first tournament in two and a half years when he pulled away to a five-stroke victory in the Phoenix Open today. Calcavecchia, once one of golf's brightest young stars but a struggling also-ran since his 1989 British Open victory, returned to form with a near-flawless, eight-under-par 63 in the final round on the Tournament Players Course at Scottsdale. He did not make a bogey, did not have a 5 on his card and won going away, finishing with a string of four consecutive birdies. Calcavecchia, who now has a home in nearby Phoenix, was given a long ovation from a huge gallery of friends and neighbors when he capped his finishing streak with a 30-yard chip-in.

Advertisement The victory, the sixth of Calcavecchia's PGA Tour career, was worth $180,000 from the total purse of $1 million. More important, however, it wrote an end to his seasons of discontent and re-established Calcavecchia as one of American golf's more accomplished performers. "There were times I questioned myself," said Calcavecchia, who reached the depths of his slump when he was beaten after what seemed a certain victory in Ryder Cup singles matches. "There were times I wondered: 'Where's Calc's putting stroke? Where's Calc's chipping stroke? Whatever happened to that guy?' " He answered his own question. "He came back this week." Duffy Waldorf, who kept pace over the front side with a 31, could not handle Calcavecchia's closing burst and finished second at 269. He had a closing 67.

KOHALA COAST, Hawaii, Jan. 26 (AP) -- Arnold Palmer staged one of his classic charges today to win two holes worth seven skins and $205,000 in the Senior Skins Game. After being shut out the first day of the two-day tournament, Palmer stormed back to win $100,000 when he chipped in from the fringe on the 12th hole, then picked up $105,000 more with a 15-foot birdie putt on No. 15. The total of $205,000 for Palmer, at 62 the oldest player in the Senior Skins, gave him the tournament title for 1992. He also won the Senior Skins in 1990, when he earned $240,000. Chi Chi Rodriguez won $105,000 today, $70,000 with a 40-foot putt for birdie on No. 17, and ran his total for the tournament to $120,000. Jack Nicklaus, the big winner last year with $310,000, this time was blanked over the nine holes played today after winning $95,000 the first day. Lee Trevino, who also came up empty today, won $30,000 on Saturday. "After the way I played Saturday, I was about as low as I've been in some time," Palmer said. "I practiced some after we played, went out and played most of the back nine, and I felt a little better starting today, felt looser." We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
