Advertisement  AP Mayor Marion Barry said today that he would consider letting Jack Kent Cooke, the owner of the Redskins, build a parking lot for a new football stadium on 36 acres of the city's historic Langston Golf Course if a new 18-hole course is created that satisfies the golfers. ''If we work out a relationahip with the golfers where we have a brand new 18-hole golf course it is possible to take 36 acres,'' the Mayro said after presenting the city's stadium plan to the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, a body of local government leaders. Cooke has expressed his desire to build a stadium on a parking lot that serves the aging Robert F. Kennedy Stadium, and to put as many as 9,000 parking spaces on part of the Langston course. Barry has opposed that plan, saying he wants to protect the historic golf course, the first in the city to admit blacks. We are continually improving the quality of our text archives.
