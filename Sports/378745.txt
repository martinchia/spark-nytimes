As the clock ticked down to the final seconds of the 2011 N.C.A.A. water polo championship game, the U.S.C. fans present started chanting âfour-peat,â the U.S.C. fight song rang out through U.C. Berkeleyâs Spieker Aquatics Complex and the U.S.C. water polo starters turned to face their fans from their positions in the pool with fists raised. The announcer couldnât be heard once the clock hit zero and every Trojan player poolside jumped into the water. They had finally done it.  They made history.  The first N.C.A.A. menâs water polo team to ever win four consecutive national titles, U.S.C. (24-3, 8-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) ended its 2011 season with the same momentum that it started with when it defeated No. 2 U.C.L.A. with a score of 7-4 in the N.C.A.A. championship game on Sunday. U.C.L.A. may have started the game with a quick goal at the end of the first quarter, but the second quarter brought with it a 5-0 run from the Trojans. By the end of the game, seven different Trojans scored for U.S.C., a nod to the powerful offensive power that the team sported all season. âThis game today was just unbelievable,â Coach Jovan Vavic said. âIt was one of those games where everything went our way. Defense was great. Our best players played the best water polo. Joel [Dennerley] was on top; they really couldnât score on him. It was a great team effort.â Senior goalie Dennerley contributed 15 saves in the game and proved essential in stopping several key Bruin drives. âYou have got to give credit to Dennerley. He is a heck of a goalie,â U.C.L.A. Coach Adam Wright said in the post-game press conference. Peter Kurzeka, a senior, attributed the teamâs success not only to its ability in the pool, but its cohesive nature.
âThe work we have put in outside the water and the relationships we have with these younger guys is what makes us successful,â he said. âWe are a good unit in and outside the water.â Kurzeka and Dennerley, who have earned a championship title for every year they played with the Trojans, served as the backbone for the team this past year. With senior Matt Burton out because of a season-ending surgery this year, the core trio was cut down to two. But that didnât stop the Trojans.  The 2011 squad was almost unchanged from last yearâs championship team. U.S.C. lost Burton, but had young talent like freshman driver Kostas Genidounias join the team as well. Though the native of Greece suffered a broken finger from a game against Cal, Genidounias made an impact on the end of the Trojansâ season regardless.
âWe worked so hard to get to this championship and we overcame so much adversity this year,â Vavic said. âOne of our best players, Matt Burton, was not here because of his injury. We had one of our key players [Genidounias] with a hand injury in the middle of the season and he missed five weeks. And we lost two games in the middle of the season. It looked like it wasnât going to be our year but the guys really came back and after those two losses in one day, everything changed.â And change did come. After back-to-back losses against No. 4 Stanford and No. 2 U.C.L.A. in the SoCal tournament at the beginning of October, the Trojansâ 22-game winning streak was snapped.  Although they lost once more to U.C.L.A. almost two months later in the M.P.S.F. final, the Trojans took their uncharacteristic losses and used them as motivation.  âThis team, whenever we needed to win games this season, when it was a must-win, we won it,â Vavic said, following the M.P.S.F. Championships. âThatâs why we are No. 1.â The Trojans will have a chance to go for five straight titles next season, but for now they are simply enjoying this year’s victory.
