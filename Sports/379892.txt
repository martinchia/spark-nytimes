 With a 2-1 victory over Honduras, Ecuador is still in the chase for a slot in the Round of 16, on the strength of two goals from forward Enner Valencia.  Honduras picked up from where they left off following a loss to France, committing a bevy of fouls early in an attempt to slow the skilled Ecuadorian forwards. For a side that needs to rely on its defensive efforts to win, the proliferation of fouls was an unwelcome signal of things to come.   The Hondurans got on the board first, however, with an open look by Carlo Costly, converted via a skipping left-footed shot. Minutes later, Ecuador's Valencia evened the score with an athletic burst that sent both he and the Honduran keeper Noel Valladares sliding toward the far post as the ball slipped into the net.   The half ended with a potential equalizer from Honduras nullified by a controversial handball call. Replays, however, seem to indicate a missed offside call against the Honduran side.   Finally, the Hondurans permitted one set piece too many, as Valencia out-jumped the Ecuadorian defense for a game-winning header in the 65th minute that had Ecuadorian fans serenading their side with songs for most of the remainder.

 They are still alive for one of those top two spots in Group E! What a match by Enner Valencia, especially.     After taking a lead on Switzerland, Ecuador was disappointed to lose. Based on its downright bad performance against France, Honduras may be just the cure. For Ecuador, a win, perhaps by multiple goals, is vital. Barring something shocking, Honduras isn't going anywhere but home. Advertisement
