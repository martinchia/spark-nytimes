During Sundayâs loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Bears running back Matt Forte was forced to leave the game due to a Grade-2 sprain of his MCL–an injury that typically keeps a player out between two and six weeks. The Bears are not saying when the team expects the star running back to return. Head Coach Love Smith went as far as to say that with four games remaining he expects Forte back this season. During his press conference Monday, Smith said, âWe will not play a player that’s injured. Once you have a healthy player, I think they’re all ready to go. And I know that’s the case with Matt Forte.â But unfortunately the realities of the N.F.L. say that Smith may not be telling the entire truth, especially not when it comes to a player like Forte, who is still playing on his rookie contract and has yet to earn a huge payday. A familiar refrain this season in regard to Forte has been âpay the manâ, which has served as a plea from fans for the Bears to extend Forte’s contract. Even other players have gotten in on the action: Pay that man #forteSun Oct 23 17:30:42  via UberSocial for BlackBerryMaurice Jones-Drew
Jones_Drew32   Among the leagueâs rushing leaders, and one of the top pass-catching running backs in the N.F.L., Forte is earning just $600,000 this season. In comparison, Adrian Peterson, the Vikings star running back, is earning $8.25 million in a contract that guarantees him $36 million over the course of seven seasons. Forte currently tops Peterson in rushing yards, average yards per carry, receptions and receiving yards. In the midst of a breakout season, and with free agency on the horizon, Forte could be feeling an immense amount of pressure to declare himself ready to go.  The situation reminds me of a conversation I had with Tiki Barber during his final season. In a discussion of Larry Johnsonâs overuse, Barber related that a player seeking guaranteed money would be willing to play on a hurt leg, making the injury worse than it initially was, because pride and dollar signs get in the way of good decision-making. “I think it’s one of two things,” Barber told me about  why a running back would be overused, possibly to his own detriment. “From a team perspective, it’s almost as if, ‘We’re not guaranteed to have him healthy all the time, so let’s get our use out of him.’ But that’s almost congruent to the player’s perspective because you think, ‘I could be out of the game or hurt tomorrow; let me do as much as I can now.'” Barber left me with a quotation that I think it particularly apt for Forte as he considers his options for the rest of the season. “People have said, ‘Wow, you played with a broken arm, you must be brave,'” Barber said, laughing. “Well, I’m either brave or stupid. At the time I was brave, in retrospect I was stupid. Because of the mentality that it takes to play this game, you do stupid stuff because you want to win. Your pride takes over and it squashes all reason.” The New York Times will report on the Giants and Jets throughout the season.
