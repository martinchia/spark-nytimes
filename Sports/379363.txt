This weekend 22-year-old Rory McIlroy cruised to a United States Open title, becoming the youngest Open champion since Bobby Jones in 1923. The incredible performance -â he finished 16-under par, eight shots ahead of the runner-up, Jason Day -â included 12 records. And it also sparked comparisons to Tiger Woods as the sport seeks a young superstar for a future that may not feature the dominant Woods the world grew accustomed to. In many ways the comparisons are valid. A 21-year-old Woods exploded onto the scene with a record-setting, 12-stroke victory at the 1997 Masters. Two months later he was the top-ranked player in the world after 42 weeks as a professional; the fastest to the ranking in history. Sundayâs win propelled McIlroy to fourth in the world. And like Woods, McIlroy was somewhat of a prodigy in his nation of Northern Ireland. In 1998, the BBC reporter Nawn said, âRemember the swing and remember the name, for at just 9 years old Rory McIlroy from Holywood is following in the footsteps of his golfing hero, Tiger Woods.â Those around the youngster were so confident that they put money on his success. A member of the golf club in McIlroyâs hometown of Holywood won 25,000 pounds on Sunday after he bet 50 pounds at 500-1 odds that McIlroy would win a major before turning 25. Gerry McIlroy, Roryâs father, may be the next to hit the jackpot. According to reports, the elder McIlroy and a few friends each bet 100 pounds at 500-1 odds that Rory would win the British Open before the age of 25.  McIlroy will have three opportunities to win the Open Championship before he turns 25 and land his father a payday. The 2011 British Open begins on July 10.
