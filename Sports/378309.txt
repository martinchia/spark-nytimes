Advertisement  AP Loyola Marymount, still mourning the death of Hank Gathers, sprinted past New Mexico State by 111-92 tonight in the first round of the West Regional behind Bo Kimble's 45 points. Both teams wore black patches in memory of Gathers, the Loyola star who died March 4 after collapsing on the court in a West Coast Conference tournament game in Los Angeles. Kimble, Gathers's boyhood friend from Philadelphia, led the tribute during the emotional night. He shot his first free throw left-handed and swished it. Gathers, a right-hander who had trouble shooting free throws, had switched to his left hand before the season started. Kimble, leading the country with a 35-point average, picked up four fouls in the first 15 minutes. He had just 12 points at halftime, but stayed in the game and led Loyola's surge as it broke away from a 46-46 tie.
