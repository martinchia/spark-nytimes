Advertisement  ERNIE GRUNFELD traveled to Milwaukee yesterday, where he was expected to be offered the Bucks' general manager position. Grunfeld, the Knicks' vice president of basketball operations, has two years remaining on his contract and may decide to remain in New York. Grunfeld said last week that he was happy with the Knicks, and DAVE CHECKETTS , the Knicks' president, has said he wants Grunfeld to stay. But HERB KOHL , the owner of the Bucks, was expected to offer Grunfeld a multiyear contract, one Grunfeld will be hard-pressed to turn down. Grunfeld is the first choice of MIKE DUNLEAVY , the new coach of the Bucks, who recently signed an eight-year, $8 million contract. After successfully luring Dunleavy away from the Los Angeles Lakers, Kohl may be able to lure Grunfeld from the Knicks, unless the Knicks match Milwaukee's offer.
