 To the Sports Editor: Re “Now Not Batting for the Mets, a Sorely Needed Designated Hitter” May 20: This article seems to advocate the universal adoption of the designated hitter rule because pitchers can’t handle a bat. Yet the argument should be whether to retain the elaborate strategy involved in having a pitcher in the batting lineup, much of which is lost in today’s American League game. If the goal is truly to have a better level of play, then baseball should make the move to separate offensive and defensive lineups, just like modern football. This would allow great hitters throughout the lineup, as well as better fielders at every position. Add free substitution so that there are always great runners on base. (Fans will never have to watch catchers or heavyset sluggers run the bases again.) The level of play would immediately increase. But baseball will lose even more of the strategy that makes it the great and unique game that it is. JEFF NELSON New York  To the Sports Editor: No to the miserable designated hitter. Yes to real baseball. Instead of eliminating a large part of the game’s strategy and attraction, wouldn’t it be better to make sure that all of the weak-hitting Mets pitchers can at least lay down a bunt on command? Surely that is yet another failure of their coaching staff. Advertisement But to ruin the only league outside Japan that still plays real baseball is pretty weak. Can’t the game do just one thing for us traditionalists? Haven’t we been through enough with mediocre teams in the playoffs, interleague play, the drive to replace umpires with machines and the ballparks-for-billionaires welfare program? One could make the case that the major leagues should play by the same rules, so how about ditching the D.H.? Let’s get back to baseball and leave the home run derby for the day before the All-Star Game.
