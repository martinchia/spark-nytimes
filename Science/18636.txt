Every year, about one out of five pregnant women in the United States is placed on bed rest, usually to help prevent complications like premature birth, hypertension and miscarriage. But in a group of studies published in the latest issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology, researchers argue that confining pregnant women to bed for long periods is not a practice based on good evidence â and it may potentially be harmful.  In one randomized study, researchers followed 657 pregnant women at high risk of delivering preterm. About 250 of the women were ordered to restrict their activities to lower their risk. But the study found that nearly 40 percent of those women ended up delivering preterm, about double the number that were not confined to bed.  Another paper that reviewed data from many previous studies could not find enough evidence to support the practice in preventing miscarriage, pregnancy-induced hypertension or low birth weight. The researchers also noted known downsides of bed rest like maternal weight loss,  bone and muscle atrophy and an increased risk of blood clots.  Because of the lack of evidence and the potential for harm, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises against bed rest for the prevention of preterm deliveries. In an editorial, one expert, Dr. Joseph R. Biggio Jr. of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, argued that doctors should limit its use in general until clinical trials prove it has benefit. Until then, he wrote, âphysicians should contemplate whether the risk-benefit ratio justifies prescribing it.â THE BOTTOM LINE  Bed rest is widely recommended in high-risk pregnancies. But there is little evidence to support it, and in some cases it may cause harm.
