One year ago, NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft zipped past Pluto and changed our understanding of the dwarf planet and its moons.
   Pluto’s gray moon Charon is so large that it causes Pluto to wobble as the pair orbit around each other.

New Horizons did not add to Pluto’s tally of five moons, but it did photograph the four small and irregularly shaped moons in the highest resolution yet. 
For decades scientists and artists imagined what Pluto might look like. New Horizons replaced those imagined landscapes with a glimpse of a surprisingly complex and shifting world of rock and exotic ices. A documentary from last year explains:
 
Months after the Pluto flyby, New Horizons had returned enough data and imagery to build a detailed virtual world. Fly over Pluto and set foot on its rugged surface in Seeking Pluto’s Frigid Heart, a seven-minute film best seen with the NYT VR app.
