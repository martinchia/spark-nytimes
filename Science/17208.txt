 TO THE EDITOR: Re “When Lyme Disease Lasts and Lasts” (Personal Health, July 9): Please don’t forget that our canine friends are susceptible to Lyme disease, too. My beautiful Bailey, a 5- 1/2-year-old yellow Lab, acted like he didn’t feel well. A trip to the vet’s revealed acute kidney failure, with Lyme the cause. Before he died, he also lost his sight and hearing. I am sure the number of affected dogs has risen along with awareness. There is a Lyme vaccine, but its efficacy is uncertain. I know of hunters who routinely give their dogs a course of tetracycline to prevent this dire disease. Given the choice, I would have of course given the vaccine for the chance to prevent my dog’s suffering and my heartbreak. Nancy Coates, M.D. Mission, Kan. A version of this letter appears in print on July 16, 2013, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Pets And Lyme Disease.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
