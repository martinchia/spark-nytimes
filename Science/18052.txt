 This is a simple way to dress up broccoli. It makes a great side dish, or you can toss it with pasta. 1 pound broccoli crowns, cut into smaller florets 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 garlic cloves, minced 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes Salt and freshly ground pepper 1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season generously with salt, and add the broccoli. Cook for three minutes until tender, and transfer — using a spider or a slotted spoon — to a bowl of ice cold water. Let sit for a few minutes and drain. Alternatively, steam the broccoli four to five minutes. 2. Heat the oil over medium heat in a medium, nonstick skillet. Add the garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook until the garlic is fragrant, 30 seconds to a minute, and add the broccoli. Toss together for a minute, and season to taste with salt. Remove from the heat, and serve. Advertisement Yield: Serves four. Advance preparation: You can make this through step 1 up to three days ahead. Keep the broccoli in a covered bowl in the refrigerator.
