 To the Editor: Re “Cancer Survival Demands Steady Progress” (April 13): Jane Brody’s column accurately reflected the enthusiasm that most oncologists have about the potential for successfully treating cancer in the future. However, it only skimmed over what will surely be the greatest impediment to bringing new treatments to patients —  outrageous costs. Every new anti-cancer drug brought to market in the last decade has cost patients or their insurers several thousands of dollars for a month or less of treatment. Many malignancies, like myeloma, highlighted by Ms. Brody, require many months or even years of treatment. It should be easy to appreciate that the costs of such treatments will present a major challenge to our nation’s ability to provide decent health care to all. All of us — health care providers, drug companies, insurers, hospitals and patients as citizens who elect our representatives — need to seriously address the cost of medicine if the promises of research are to have a chance of being realized in patients.
