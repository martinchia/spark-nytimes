 To the Editor: Re “The 10 Biggest Choking Hazards” (May 25): Laurie Tarkan writes: “If a child is choking, call 911...”  In fact, if one calls 911 and does nothing else, the several minutes wait for emergency medical personnel could result in the child’s brain damage or death. The recommendation of the American Heart Association for a child older than one year of age who is choking is to perform the Heimlich maneuver without delay. Joel Herskowitz, M.D. Roya Sayadi Natick, Mass. To the Editor: For decades, scientific studies have warned that back blows and finger swipes should never be used to treat choking persons as they drive choking objects deeper and tighter into the airway, causing death. The Heimlich Maneuver, recommended by medical authorities since 1974, compresses the lungs producing a flow of air that drives the choking object out of the airway and out the mouth, thus saving the lives of choking infants and adults. Henry J. Heimlich, M.D. Cincinnati The writer received the 1984 Albert Lasker Public Service Award for developing the Heimlich Maneuver. A version of this letter appears in print on June 1, 2010, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Food As a Choking Hazard.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
