“Gazpacho is a summer soup, incredibly refreshing on a hot day,” writes Martha Rose Shulman in this week’s Recipes for Health. And with tomato season in full swing, it couldn’t be a better time. She writes: This week I decided to forget about the bread and focus in on the combination of tomatoes, vinegar, olive oil, onion and garlic that is really behind the signature flavor of gazpacho. The new Spanish chefs have been reinterpreting this lively, low-calorie soup for over a decade now, so I felt free to experiment, too.  This weekâs recipes are in essence healthy vegetable smoothies, and indeed, without the garnishes they are drinkable from a glass, or a shot-glass if you want to serve them as tapas.  Here are five new ways to make gazpacho. Gazpacho sans Bread: Keep this gazpacho in a pitcher in the refrigerator and enjoy all summer long.  Blender Gazpacho With Celery, Carrot, Cucumber and Red Pepper: A version of gazpacho that is essentially a tangy, pungent vegetable smoothie. Chipotle Gazpacho: Chipotle contributes heat and smoke to this beautiful blender gazpacho. Tomatillo, Tomato and Avocado Gazpacho: Avocados contribute a creamy texture to this spicy gazpacho. Beet and Tomato Gazpacho: The color alone is reason enough to make this gorgeous gazpacho. Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
