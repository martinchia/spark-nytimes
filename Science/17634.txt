 THE FACTS Like mistletoe and poinsettia, holly is prized for its beauty and feared for its rumored toxicity. But studies show that much like its two Christmas companions, holly is not quite as deadly as portrayed. Its berries, which contain a caffeinelike alkaloid, might cause irritation, but a fatal ingestion is unlikely. According to  a one study by the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, plant exposures are the fourth most common cause of poisoning in the country. Ingestion of holly is among the five most common when it comes to plants. A  study by researchers at the University of Rochester reviewed 103 cases of toxic berry ingestion over  two years, all  involving  children who swallowed six or fewer berries of holly, yew or nightshade.  The children who were given ipecac experienced vomiting, diarrhea and “sedation.” The others, who were simply monitored closely, did not, suggesting that symptoms  attributed to holly and other berries might  be a result of ipecac. When accidental ingestion occurs,  scientists said, it is best to consult a poison control center. But no need to banish that bough of holly. THE BOTTOM LINE Holly may be problematic, but it is not as toxic as widely believed. scitimes@nytimes.com A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D5 of the National edition with the headline: Holly and its decorative berries can be deadly.
