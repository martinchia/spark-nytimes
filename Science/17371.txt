 Astronomers have discovered a planet with a ring system that is 200 times larger than Saturn’s. The planet, the first of its kind to be found outside our solar system, is surrounded by 30 rings, each tens of millions of kilometers in diameter with large gaps that indicate the presence of small moons. The discovery, described in Astrophysical Journal, was made by scientists at the University of Rochester and Leiden Observatory in the Netherlands. They were investigating mysterious eclipses of the planet’s star, which turned out to be caused by the rings. A version of this article appears in print on February 3, 2015, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Astronomy: A Planet With Rings That Dwarf Saturn’s.
