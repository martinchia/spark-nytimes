 Q. If added weight in the midsection raises the risk of health problems like diabetes and heart trouble, does a tummy tuck or liposuction lower the risk?  A. “The answer is no, because the risky fat is inside the abdominal wall, in and around the organs,” said Dr. Louis Aronne, director of the comprehensive weight management program at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York. A tummy tuck or liposuction “removes superficial, subcutaneous fat, which has little or no risk,” he said. “In such procedures, there is no change in what we call cardiometabolic risk factors, like insulin activity, blood sugar, triglycerides or any of the lipid parameters.” “The fat in the liver and muscles and in and around the internal organs is the overflow from what is not stored under the skin, and it is the overflow that causes the damage.” Researchers do not yet have the results of studies of what happens when fat is removed from inside the abdomen in operations like laparoscopic banding for obesity. Cutting down on calories and food intake does improve risk factors, Dr. Aronne said. The benefit is found in reduced fat levels and in the fewer hormones that need to be produced to process calories.
