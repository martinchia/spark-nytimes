 To the Editor: In her essay “No Face, but Plants Like Life Too” (March 15), Carol Kaesuk Yoon suggests that since plants cling to life as we do, perhaps we shouldn’t eat them. But isn’t consuming some form of life essential to our own nutrition? No, it turns out. Decades ago NASA scientists showed that humans could live on an unappetizing mixture of about 50 pure chemicals (sugar, amino and fatty acids, vitamins and minerals). The chemicals in turn could all be made from rocks, air and water without any killing at all. No one eats such “mineralarian” food today, but the fact that one could highlights a tension between the widespread dietary goals of avoiding cruelty and avoiding unnatural ingredients.    Charles H. Bennett Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y. ♦ To the Editor: Carol Kaesuk Yoon’s intellectual gymnastics to rationalize eating meat have led her to a moral vacuum. By stating that plants may also have feelings, she takes no ethical action at all. None of us can individually change the whole world. We can only have a healing impact on the animals and people with whom we come in contact. What is the value of our lives if we do not do that?    Irene Muschel New York Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
