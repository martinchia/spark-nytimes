 To the Editor: Re “Polar Sidekicks Earn a Place on the Map” (Sept. 28): When I traveled to Antarctica in the 1980s on an Argentine polar supply ship, my onshore experience included trips inland on sleds pulled by teams of dogs. These courageous, lovable animals did their work in a spirit of camaraderie that was inspirational. The naming of Antarctic landmarks for worthy dogs will honor their invaluable contributions to the exploration of this continent; it is an honor long overdue.    Joan Larsen Park Forest, Ill.
