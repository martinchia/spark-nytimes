 To the Editor: Re “Particles Faster Than the Speed of Light? Not So Fast, Some Say” (Oct. 25): It should be emphasized that no actual light signals were sent for comparison between CERN in Geneva and Gran Sasso in Italy. This is because while neutrinos can go through solid rock, obviously light signals cannot. Thus the CERN scientists do not know by direct measurement how long it would have taken light to travel the same path that the neutrinos did. Only after it has been shown empirically that both the distance and the neutrino travel time are known accurately can one say that one knows the speed of neutrinos with sufficient accuracy to compare with the speed of light. Given how fundamental the issue is, it is sound science to reserve judgment as to whether the neutrinos have violated the Einstein speed limit. Frank R. Tangherlini San Diego ♦ To the Editor: Dennis Overbye wrote, “Technically, relativity does allow some particles, known as tachyons, to go faster than light.” A tachyon is an imaginary or hypothetical particle. Rather than being an exception to the theory of relativity, which establishes the velocity of light as the universal and absolute speed limit, the theoretical tachyonic field has been used for esoteric mathematical gymnastics in certain quantum field theory. But a tachyon simply cannot exist as a particle. Amit Sarkar Scarsdale, N.Y. Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
