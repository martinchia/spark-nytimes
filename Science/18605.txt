For most couples, passion and romance eventually fade over time, and a more calm, contented love takes over as the years go by.  But for long-together couples who fear boredom has set in, brain and behavior researchers have come up with a simple prescription for reigniting the fires of romantic love. To learn more, click here to read my Well column about reinventing date night in today’s Science Times. And then take the following quiz to find out how you score on the passion meter. This passionate love scale was developed by Elaine Hatfield, psychology professor at the University of Hawaii, and Susan Sprecher, psychology and sociology professor at Illinois State University. It was designed to assess the cognitive, emotional and behavioral aspects of passionate love and has been widely used by relationship researchers for the past two decades. Dr. Hatfield notes that the scale is useful for researchers, but that couples should only take the test for fun and not make major decisions based on how they score on the 15-item scale. “Love and life are very complex, and a person’s emotions are always nuanced,” she said.  Answer the following questions to test your level of passionate love. Think of the person you love most passionately now, and respond by circling the appropriate response. Answers range from (1) not at all true to (9) definitely true.  Then, add up your scores and check the scale below to see how hot your love fires burn. Comments are no longer being accepted. I found this quiz interesting, but is how “deep” love is really what it is measuring? I think that passionate love may be very different from a love that is intimate and based on deep feelings. Maybe “I want my partner to know me” is testing deep feelings, not just lust and obsession, but are the rest, really? I’d love for my long term relationship to have most of the aspects that this tests for, but I don’t know if that would make it lasting. my friend katie sent this to me- she thought it was funny.. i think it’s funny and borderline creepy… don’t get freaked out by the ‘l’ word in the title– i say that as much for myself as u.. thought it was interesting- no need/pressure to share ur ans/score w/ me ta! my fifty years long married life is very pleasent one still conti nues Hm. I scored 167, more than is mathematically possible. Either I’m truly madly deeply in love, or I double clicked a few times while tallying up my score with the computer calculator application. Maybe both! Tara, I enjoy your blog and  health  columns, but this one is downright silly and misleading.  Love is less a brain activity than a cultural activity.  If you want to look for the scientific basis of love, you will have more success looking at how humans evolved as social animals and the role love played in giving a survival advantage to some people. I think some of the wording in this survey is potentially “dangerous”.  I mean, most people think it’s a good thing to be “passionate”,and so most would like to know that they scored high on this test.  And if they do, they might think that’s a good thing.  But let’s not confuse passion with obsessive or controlling behavior/thoughts. “Sometimes I can’t control my thoughts…they are obsessively on my partner. ….I would rather be with my partner than anyone else (at all times?)….my partner always seems to be on my mind.” Scoring high on the particular questions I listed above…I don’t think it necessarily points to passion per se.  People who score high on such questions are more than likely insecure and/or jealous, controlling, or they think “being in love” is all about being glued at the hip of one’s partner 24/7.  I wouldn’t call that “passion”. I hope the government (people) did not spend a lot of money to document the obvious-again. A high school kid could have developed this scale. All women think about is relationships! Guys are easy. Women are pretty much interchangable parts for men. Guys are more likely to fall in love and stay in love with gals who keep their figures, don’t nag, play fair, do sex the way their guy likes it, and maintain a cheerful demeanor. In short they want Harrison Ford’s uncomplaining sex droid played by the scrumptous Sean Young in “Blade Runner”. In reality they are more likely to end with the equivalent of the female droid in Klaus Kinski’s fabulous sci fi movie “Android”.  Look at this way. If romantic love was all it’s cracked up to be, there’d be no need for love stories, romantic songs, etc.. Ever hear of people not knowing the benefits of getting and cashing a government check? This inventory is wastage of time and energy. If one is in love he or she need not to be evaluated on a scale. One automatically knows the answer of the inventory. Mark Klein, Don’t you ever get bored of posting offensive comments that have very little to do with the substance of a blog entry?  I would respond to your post, but it is so ridiculous that its not even worth it. To Mark Klein, M.D.-
I am surprised that someone with an M.D., or for that matter any exposure whatsoever to the scientific world, would post such a generalization about male/female behavior.  I do hope you have no interaction with patients, given that you had the hubris to list your full name, and that female patients probably would not like being referred to as “interchangeable parts” (then again, I don’t want to generalize). As for the “test” itself – it strikes me as a pretty dodgy way of gauging passion, let alone love. As to Mr. Klein’s comments, surely he was being facetious when outlining the things men care most about in a woman??! You can’t gauge love, passion, intimacy, or any other human emotion on a scale from 15 – 135.  This is another indication of human beings’ obsession with imposing order on things that defy measurement or categorization.  When will we accept love in all its complexity, though it confounds us, though it defies ‘conventional wisdom’?  When will we bask in the beauty that is love instead of attempting to analyze it, measure it, quantify it, or reduce it with our woefully inadequate tools of ‘measurement’? It’s good that women are interchangeable parts to Dr. Klein, since I suspect those parts change on him rather often, as the women he dates figure out that he’s a bit of a misogynistic jerk. Then again, if he’s been married forever by some strange quirk of fate… I feel awfully sorry for his wife. And I doubt very much that TPP meant this as a scientific study. Enjoy the quiz for the fun fluff it is (for the most part). Matt, You have the hubris to criticize Dr. Klein and use the word, “hubris.” I had to go look up the definition.  True arrogance is when people use difficult words just to look smart when simple words will do. 22 years and still hitting 8’s and 9’s….but that is this month; a few months ago we would have struggled for 5s and 6s…marriage/relationships are constantly ebbing and flowing. The best advice that I received when we were starting out was that when you are in a ‘valley’ remember that a ‘peak’ will eventually come back around as long as you continue to love and respect each other. Marriage is the most important decision that we make because it effects every aspect of our life; education, financial, children, health.   I have seen happy lives ruined by people (men and women) who have chosen the wrong person to marry.   I wish that there was a foolproof test to help  people pair up in loving, respectful, passionate relationships.   Unfortunately I think that Harville Hendricks “Getting the Love You Want” is correct; we often choose mates based on unfinished business with our parents.  Yuck! Freud is creepy. How deep is our love?  When I had a life- threatening illness, my husband came to the hospital everyday and gently gave me my bath, washed my hair and dressed me so I would feel human in spite of the tubes and wires attached to me.  He would bring our children to see me every night and take care of them at home, we would say good night prayers on speaker phone and not know if I would be there tomorrow. The depth of love is not just that he makes me tingle when he touches me 22 years after we said ‘I do’ but that we protect each other, support each other and even though we have loud, breathtakingly angry fights, we settle down, and realize that by being the first to apologize or accept the blame, we put our marriage before our egos. A better test might measure whether you are able to set aside being ‘right’ because you know that if you apologize it will defuse the anger and you will be able to solve the problem. Paging Dr. Klein… Paging Dr. Klein… We just got back the results from your test. You are a Raging Narcissist. I also suspect you are divorced, that your wife left you for mental abuse of living with a narcissist, and that no ‘interchangeable parts’ are forthcoming. On the dumbing down of America. If ‘hubris’ is too hard a word, you must be watching too much TV.  Language is a precious thing.  What is arrogance is telling other people to stunt their fluent expression because you are too lazy or feel it is beneath you to look it up.  You should be happy.  You gain a new word and learn how to use it in context.  You got something of value that makes communication richer.   I look up words if I need to and am thrilled like I gained a new tool. I suggest you do the same.  I would assume the readership of the NY Times is above average, so don’t carp.  Otherwise, you can go hang out at Perez Hilton’s blog and not strain your brain.  You seem to want to feel intellectual at the expense of a love of learning. This is silly. You canât gauge love. It is too complex. A FUSS.What is love? So this is what love is all about, huh?  Love makes you subject to “deep despair” and creates the strong potential for becoming “extremely depressed.”  Love causes “obsessive” thinking that you “can’t control” and creates strong mental fixations (“always on my mind”).  It creates jealousy and the exclusion of other kinds of relationships in your life (“rather be with my partner than anyone else.”)  Wow, this is making love sound like a terrible thing for your mental health.   I agree with #6 … I think the way this quiz is worded is a little strange, and I don’t really think these particular markers are a good measure of love.  Or if they are, maybe I don’t want any part of it. People, lighten up.  It’s just a quiz. Some of these questions appear to test possessiveness and  insecurity.  If one is always eagerly looking for affection, it implies that the amount received is inadequate and/or the person is extremely insecure in the relationship.  If one cannot get the object of one’s love out of one’s mind it suggests to me that there may be a diminished sense of self and/or an otherwise unfulfilled life.   Perhaps asking if one still feels a warmth and contentment when one’s partner enters the room would be a reasonable question.  Perhaps it would be reasonable to distinguish between being in heat and being in love.  By the way I scored 113 points. Hmm. Going through these questions I found myself feeling both warm and appreciative for my sweet husband, and sad and wistful for the passion we shared in our early days together, but is long gone. Oh! To have that honeymoon once again! I think some of the previous commentators didn’t realize that your introduction for this scale explained that it is the standard scale used by scientists studying love.  While I can sympathize with those who say this scale is misleading (it measures “passionate” love vs. deeper love), or culturally biased (yeah… but how do you study love outside of culture?  how do you study anything  social outside of culture?) or even juvenile/creepy, I do think it is more understandable if you look at it from the scientists’ point of view.  How else would they measure the vivacity of a couple’s love?  While many who would score low on this scale would object on the basis that they are still deeply in love and would never leave each other, I’m sure if you think about it, you can understand that many couples who score low on this scale would not be doing well.
