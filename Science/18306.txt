 To the Editor: Between the lines of “Flu Story: A Pregnant Woman’s Ordeal” (Oct. 20) is a powerful rationale for the need for comprehensive health care reform. The facts of the story are: a husband believes he contracted the flu and passed it along to his pregnant wife. She was hospitalized for four months. After her lungs collapsed the third time, her baby was delivered by emergency C-section and died after seven minutes. Months later, Aubrey Opdyke is still struggling to recover. Health insurance covered only 80 percent of her hospital bills. This young family owes $200,000 in medical bills. Should this family really have to suffer any more? We must provide medical coverage that covers all, or the vast majority, of our medical bills — for all Americans. Alexandra Olins Winooski, Vt. Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
