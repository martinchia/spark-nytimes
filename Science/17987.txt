 To The Editor: “Doubt on Anti-Aging Molecule as Drug Trial Stops” (Jan. 11) includes a comment attributed to me that requires clarification. While the substance in question, resveratrol, is thought to activate a protein called SIRT1, I know of no evidence that it “actually inhibits SIRT1.” I did say that while resveratrol can activate SIRT1, some doses can affect the activity of other protein targets in a cell. This multiplicity of biological activity, combined with the difficulty of maintaining a stable, effective concentration of the compound in the bloodstream, makes it impractical as a potential medicine.
