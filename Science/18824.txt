Sea level rise is only one of many impacts expected to worsen greatly in the next several decades. It is time we accept that we already pay a “carbon tax” in the actual costs of greenhouse gas pollution.  The Times should call on the Senate Finance Committee to advance carbon tax legislation to replace energy subsidies. Put that tax at the point of extraction or import where it belongs, and return revenue equally to all households. We then have a choice: Use the cash to offset fossil fuel prices, or buy clean energy instead. Jeanne Brunson South Setauket, N.Y. Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
