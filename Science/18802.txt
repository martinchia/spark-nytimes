Pain doesn’t show up on a body scan and can’t be measured in a test. As a result, many chronic pain sufferers turn to art, opting to paint, draw or sculpt images in an effort to depict their pain. “It’s often much more difficult to put pain into words, which is one of the big problems with pain,” said Allan I. Basbaum, editor-in-chief of Pain, the medical journal of The International Association for the Study of Pain. “You can’t articulate it, and you can’t see it. There is no question people often try to illustrate their pain.” One of the most famous pain artists is Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, whose work, now on exhibit at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, is imbued with the lifelong suffering she experienced after being impaled during a trolley accident as a teenager. Her injuries left her spine and pelvis shattered, resulting in multiple operations and miscarriages, and she often depicted her suffering on canvas in stark, disturbing and even bloody images. Sacramento resident Mark Collen, 47, is a former insurance salesman who suffers from chronic back pain. After his regular doctor retired due to illness, Mr. Collen was struggling to find a way to communicate his pain to a new doctor. Although he has no artistic training, he decided to create a piece of artwork to express his pain to the physician. “It was only when I started doing art about pain, and physicians saw the art, that they understood what I was going through,” Mr. Collen said. “Words are limiting, but art elicits an emotional response.” Mr. Collen wrote to pain doctors around the world to solicit examples of art from pain patients. Working with San Francisco college student James Gregory, 21, who suffers from chronic pain as the result of a car accident, the two created the Pain Exhibit, an online gallery of art from pain sufferers. The images are evocative and troubling. “Some of them are painful even to look at,” Dr. Basbaum said. In November, he included an image from the site on the cover of Pain; it can be seen here. Finding ways to communicate pain is essential to patients who are suffering, many of whom don’t receive adequate treatment from doctors. In January, Virtual Mentor, the American Medical Association Journal of Ethics, reported that certain groups are less likely to receive adequate pain care. Hispanics are half as likely as whites to receive pain medications in emergency rooms for the same injuries; older women of color have the highest likelihood of being undertreated for cancer pain; and being uneducated is a risk factor for poor pain care in AIDS patients, the journal reported. Some of the images from the Pain Exhibit, like “Broken People” by Robert S. Beal of Tulsa, Okla., depict the physical side of pain. Others, such as “Against the Barrier to Life,” convey the emotional challenges of chronic pain. “I feel like I am constantly fighting against a tidal wave of pain in order to achieve some quality of life,” wrote the work’s creator, Judith Ann Seabrook of Happy Valley in South Australia. “I am in danger of losing the fight and giving up.” Mr. Collen said the main goal of the exhibit is to raise awareness about the problem of chronic pain. However, he said he hopes one day to find a sponsor to take the exhibit on tour. “People don’t believe what they can’t see,” Mr. Collen said. “But they see a piece of art an individual created about their pain and everything changes.” To see a slide show of selections from the Pain Exhibit, click here, or visit the Web site to see the full gallery of photos. Another slide show from The Times in February features art created by migraine sufferers. Comments are no longer being accepted. Hey Tara, how about a NSFW warning!!! FROM TPP — There is nothing about this that is not suitable for work. Pain, as noted by Atul Gawande in his excellent book complications, along with nausea, is an extremely difficult clinical problem.  Our tools are clumsy, ineffective often, and carry a raft of side-effects.  I prefer these expressions to the 10-point scale so often used and promoted by regulatory agencies, which is essentially useless, and often abused. It makes me even more upset with people that fake maladies to get medications, although even that is often murky, too.  Unfortunately, there have been some studies where aggressive pain management actually worsened outcomes–likely due to side-effects from primarily narcotic medications.  This is not an easy problem. I was lucky enough to see the Frida Kahlo exhibition when it was at the Minneapolis Minnesota Walker Art Center. Powerful stuff. If it comes to your area, don’t miss it. As for her painting “Broken Column” not being suitable for work, hundreds of middle-school and high-school children were bused by their schools to Walker to view it, in addition to her other paintings. When I went there, it was a real mob scene of school kids. For doctors pain is the most difficult symptom to treat, not because of the lack of effective treatments but because everyone experiences pain differently.  It’s why the 10-point scale is fairly useless.  For pediatric patients the face scale (various degrees of grimacing and a child points to the face that best represents them) is probably a more trustworthy scale and after looking at the images presented here it seems obvious how visual representations of pain are just easier for all of us to interpret. //savvydoc.wordpress.com Ditto Savvydoc – also for infants (rather than children generally) they may react to pain quite differently to what we’d expect and therefore not have their pain properly recognized. There’s been work done on newborn circumcision (with only topical anesthetic or none at all) that shows it is wrong to assume if they don’t cry it doesn’t hurt. Often babies go into shock and don’t cry but their cortisol levels go way up as a result of the stress of pain. Same goes for mothers in childbirth – the effects of high cortisol on other health indicators is explored in some studies and the effect of pain on cortisol levels is known but few make the link – that pain in childbirth is actually not great for your health or the baby’s. Oxygenation levels in newborns are higher when the pain is effectively controlled (without opiates which of course depress respiration, so you need non-opiate pain relief such as spinal or epidural not demerol).  That message is interesting because its often seen as “closer” to a non-medicated birth to have something “just to take the edge off” but actually it is safer to have the non-opiate which takes more pain away but more safely than demerol et al. It is very important to get pain recognized as requiring treatment in its own right and not just as a symptom.  In the words of one of my favourite Brit sitcoms (My Family) “don’t tell me it is mild discomfort, I’m a dentist, I know that means it hurts like hell”. Another issue for palliative pain relief is trade offs. Some of the best pain relief has effects like drowsiness and addiction that patients don’t like, but we have to talk more about these trade offs to make them more acceptable until we can make better drugs. I think a large part of patients refusing effective pain relief is that they’re conditioned not to want to lose their full consciousness. Fear is a big part of that.  Strangely some seem to fear that loss of control more than death itself. Clearly we need to be more open and supportive of people so that they have less fear of pain relief. I find it simply horrible that (some) people would rather die than be pain free and less conscious. That is a real indictment on how much we support palliative care patients. SavvyDoc and Jillyflower are absolutely right. I live in chronic pain and have for several years. While I spent most of the past three or four years on narcotic pain medications, I find that I would rather deal with the pain and have a semi-normal lie that have a more comfortable life. Sure there are some days when the pain is unbearable and I want to be on narcotic pain medicine; but, most days I just deal with it. As a former health care provider, I understand the complexities of treating pain and in most cases chronic pain is even more complex because it requires constant adjustment, trial and error and a host of other problems. But, untill the healthcare system recognizes how difficult pain is to treat and that every individual deserves the same level of commfort no improvements in pain managment will be made.
I am a lond time supporter of The Pain Exhibit and I tell my doctors to look at the website when they ask me to describe my pain and as a result I get better care; but, I find it rather odd that I have to take to such extreme measures to get them to listen to me.
If you suffer from pain or if you are a healthcare provide, I strongly suggest you look at the exhibit as a whole to better understand what it is like to live in pain. Pain (and suffering) are probably the most significant reasons for making art – describing a world where Eden no longer exists. My A Perfect Friend collage works explore suffering as well.  Take a look: //homepage.mac.com/mistahcoughdrop/PhotoAlbum2.html I’m showing these works at the Defoor Centre Gallery in Atlanta, Georgia this May. Matthew Rose/Paris, France An alternative (non-drug) approach to pain can be found in Jon Kabat-Zinn’s work and the Stress Reduction Program (Center for Mindfulness, University of Massachusetts Medical School). Counterintuitively, heightened awareness of the body, including its pain, through mindfulness meditation can reduce the prominence of pain in one’s daily life. That is an awesome article, a picture is worth a thousand words, old clichÃ©; but how trueâ¦. Yes, what an excellent therapy for pain…of the mind and body…such an exercise deepens our creative flow…an instant soothing gel> Great post Also see Stephen Levine’s book: Who Dies. Working with chiropractic techniques, yoga, and homeopathic remedies are much more helpful than pain medication and surgery. This advice is from one who knows, and would be dead if I followed the advice of allopathic medicine and physicians. The reason why Hispanics have less pain medication is because of the use of herbs and the help of trusty curanderas. We know that hospitals are not safe places. I have experienced severe pain from herniated discs.  There are no words to describe it.  This exhibit is excellent.  If I had artistic talent I would explore the feeling that one has to prove the pain is real to get appropriate relief.  I experienced this level of pain only twice, separated by over a decade.  Obviously I am not an addict!!! I’m ANGRY (forgive me) that all this talk of PAIN, and nobody mentions LUPUS, which I’ve have for over 20 years. Talk about CHRONIC Pain from head to toe, and I’m NOT a complainer! I DO deal with it, and well. I was a competitive, award-winning athlete, and one of the few making my living in SAG/AFTRA (unions for the entertainment industry) athlete, then, hit with Lupus and several other autoimmune illnesses. The pain in my head, joints, neck, back, hands, feet, wrists, elbows and on and on, bla bla bla, a broken record. I’ve been to all the best pain clinics with all the best meds – yoga, exercise, meditation, prayer, etc. When it’s time to be healed, and if, it will happen. My art (fine/digital/photography/acting) are EXTREMELY healing for me. I encourage people to PERSEVERE Anyway!!! And find HUMOR. Thanks for letting me share….Chris Jaksy, dogdayart :) I found this article very interesting especially in light of the recent migraine articles and the recurring theme of synesthesia in examinations of neurology. When I was a child, I was synesthetic in only one aspect: I saw pain in colors.  When I felt different kinds of pain, I saw them illustrated in my mind in different colors.  Sometimes I could even lessen the pain by concentrating on a different color than the color I was seeing (e.g., for bad headaches which I saw in red, I would concentrate on blue enveloping the red and the pain would lessen).  The only pain I could never control and could never pin a certain color onto was that of migraines, as they had several colors (although a strong stem of flashing magenta).  Since around puberty I no longer see colors when I feel pain, at least not regularly or in any quantifiable way, and since I finished high school I (thankfully!) have not suffered a migraine. I wonder if any of these patients-turned-artists experience the same wire-crossing as I did in relating pain to color. Programs like this fascinate me.  Pain can be incredibly hard to communicate, because each person’s experience with pain is unique and has an emotional context as well.  We rarely remember the feeling of the pain itself, but we do remember the emotional state it put us in and how we felt about the pain we were experiencing.  I can’t recall the actual feeling of having gallstones, but I can recall quite vividly the feeling of lying curled up, sobbing, on my bathroom floor because I hurt so much and I felt so helpless; nothing I did would make the pain stop.  Being able to identify with that helplessness and anguish in others who are experiencing pain has been a big factor in helping people cope with and recover from injury and illness.  Maybe I’ve never had a migraine, but I have had the emotional response to “Oh, gods, why won’t the pain just stop and let me go?” and we can connect on that level. And TPP, I think the NSFW request might have been because of the Frida Kahlo “The Broken Column” picture, because while it’s an artistic form, it is still a woman with bared breasts and some people’s workplaces have a problem even with artistically painted bare breasts. The Pain Exhibit is an absolute blessing in articulating pain.  A world-wide tour would be a fabulous opportunity to open the eyes of the medical profession and the public in advancing the enormous avenues of help. I have taken opiates for chronic pain for years, and, guess what – I don’t hurt!  I think there is a puritanical suspicion of treating pain by actually relieving it.  As to aaron’s objections to people faking it, it’s a good clinician’s responsibility to get to the heart of a patient’s complaint.  No medication is not always the answer, but neither is not medicating.  Pain relief needs to be seen as a human right, not some sort of moral or will-power issue.  I am on disability, and I’m not quite as sharp as I once was, but when I was in pain, my whole life was devoted to coping with pain. It was my doctor’s not my decision to get permanent disability.  Since then I lead a life that includes bicycling, gardening,  & volunteering. I make art, too, but not about my pain.  It’s not exactly the most fascinating thing about my life. A great exhibit! I have such a hard time explaining my chronic pain to my friends and family. Though it was painful for some of them to see how the artists represented their own pain, I think having a visual finally made my pain more tangible to them. And the exhibit reminded me that I’m not alone in my suffering. The last time I tried to get non-drug help with chronic back, leg and foot pain I was verbally abused, smirked at and mocked. This was a clinic of physicians who make their living off those in chronic pain! That’s the last time I will seek help from western medicine. I’m not interested in spending my days in a drug-induced stupor, and they aren’t interested in helping patients achieve pain management with non-drug modalities. I think that is quite impressive and an interesting idea. I would like to point out to another exhibition which was recently held at Festspielhaus Bregenz: German Art Photographer Karsten Thormaehlen potrayed 100 year old people from Berlin and around Berlin. It was called Century Men and made it to the Website of tagesschau.de – the national German TV station’s website. Take a look at these healthy and happy 100 year olds. They seem so painless even though they have reached this high age. It was interesting that the artist mentioned that they seemed to be so strong even though they are that old.  //www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/bilder/jahrhundertmensch26.html I have dealt with my own pain through my art over years. Many times it was the only way I could “verbalize” the pain of the sudden violent death of my family. For train and untrained artists (we are all artists) art can be a powerful voice to make sense of the world. There is no life without pain,  no art without pain, no joy without pain looming eagerly in the distance, both near and far.
Growing up in a family of artists who were strangled by their own bizarre, upsetting childhoods, art became king for all of us in order to breathe upright, and sometime lying down.
Creativity in the forms of writing, drawing and sewing were like water, air, heart and blood.
It saved us all from being in virtual hell. “There is no life without pain” – Francesca Safran This article and associated exhibit pertain to chronic pain, which there is most certainly life without. I’m referring to the normal life most people lead blissfully, comparatively, and luckily. This simply, but aptly, labeled art exhibit is exemplary in it’s demonstration of the constant battle and manifestations of chronic pain on an individual. The debilitation stemming from moderate to severe chronic pain can be all-encompassing: a key message visually depicted in the Pain Exhibit, and an unfortunate reality faced daily by chronic pain sufferers. One problem with recognition of pain is likely that chronic pain looks different than acute pain. If you slam your finger in the door you’ll scream, maybe cry make faces, and forget about it as soon as the pain fades. Chronic pain even if of much less severity is insideous, rather than the usual reaction people tend to get depressed. I’ve experienced this with allergies, even though the discomfort is nothing compared to slipping on ice and falling down a flight of stairs or other unpleasant acute pain, the fact that its never ending is what makes it much worse. Fall down a flight of stairs, if nothings broken or horribly damaged you know the bruises will be gone in a week or so, there is a known progression to wellness. This is a really interesting theme for an exhibition. Kahlo is one of my favorite artists and she’s been on my mind lately. I blogged about Kahlo’s focus on her pain myself last week at //dcscorpiongirl.wordpress.com. I think that pain is such an essential part of Kahlo’s work but while I have always thought of how pain *informs* her art, I think it’s very fascinating to look at ways other artists are addressing experiences of chronic pain.  I have a friend who is a photographer and she created a project of fragmented pictures of herself reaching towards the viewer, seeking some type of solace. She explained that it depicted her constant struggle with migraines and other chronic pain. I honestly had no idea she was suffering in such an intense way until I saw her work.
