 About a month after a recent trip to Belize, Vanessa Serrao, a wildlife filmmaker in Silver Spring, Md., noticed an oozing bump on her head. She told her doctor she had heard stories about a hairy insect called the botfly, which uses mosquitoes as a vector to deposit larvae under human skin. “Then the doctor looked with a magnifying glass,” Ms. Serrao, 33, said, “and she said, ‘Yes, there is something living in there.’ ” The doctor had no immediate way to remove the wriggling, chewing larva. But though Ms. Serrao was eager to get rid of it — “It did wake me up from sleep at 3 a.m.; I heard it crunching,” she said — she also realized that she had been given a singular opportunity for a nature photographer. So she videotaped herself and her surprisingly stoic husband, Greg Hiemenz, as they tried to dislodge the larva. The resulting video, posted on Ms. Serrao’s Web site, www.NatureBreak.org, has become a hit on YouTube. It documents her mix of disgust and fascination. When her husband tells her he can see the larva, she screams, “Oh, my God!” and then adds, “Maybe we’ll get a tripod.” Finally, the doctor recommends putting tape on the bump to smother the creature, allowing Mr. Hiemenz to pull it out with tweezers. Be warned. This video is not for the squeamish. Even Ms. Serrao had trouble watching it.  “It was so gross to me,” she said. “I couldn’t get the nerve up. Some time had to pass before I had enough separation to be able to watch it.” TARA PARKER-POPE  A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Awareness: Squeamish?
