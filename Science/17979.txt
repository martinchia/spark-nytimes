 Q. I have wondered why musical and stage artists never sneeze or cough while performing. Is there a biological explanation? A. Performers can sneeze or cough during a performance, but you very seldom see it, for a combination of reasons, said Dr. Michael G. Stewart, chairman of the department of otolaryngology at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. “First, anyone with an acute illness or allergies will usually be on medical treatment around the time of the performance to control the symptoms, and those treatments are usually quite successful,” said Dr. Stewart, who is also medical director of the Center for the Performing Artist at the hospital. Someone still ill enough to be coughing would probably cancel the performance or use an understudy, he said. But an important consideration is that both mental concentration and the demands of performance can suppress the reflex to cough, sneeze or clear the throat, Dr. Stewart said. “This would be a frontal lobe function,” he said. “In addition, just as you can suppress a sneeze or a cough by a slow breath or swallowing,” he said, “a performer can use techniques such as careful breathing and swallowing to limit those reactions during breaks in the performance as well.” C.
