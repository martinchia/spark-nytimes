 To the Editor: Re “An Apology With Echoes of 12 Steps” (Feb. 23): Tiger Woods’s so-called rehabilitation and his recent public statement highlight the increasing emphasis in our culture on the symptoms of psychopathology and not the underlying causes. Mr. Woods’s arrogance, entitlement, grandiosity and dishonesty reflect character traits that therapists routinely encounter in individuals with pronounced narcissistic personality disorders. As many therapists know, when such individuals are “caught,” the remorse they express — while seemingly genuine at the time of the crisis — is often short-lived. Unfortunately, 12-step programs for “sex addicts” often fail to appreciate and address the deeper character pathology inherent in the behavior of our modern-day Casanovas.  Jeffrey M.
