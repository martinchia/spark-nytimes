 Some dieters say that eating less at one meal is ineffective, because people compensate by eating more at other meals. Not so, according to a small study in the October issue of the journal Appetite. In fact, eating one reduced-calorie meal a day, and then eating what you want the rest of the day, may be an effective weight-loss technique. For two weeks, researchers had 17 men and women eat all their meals and snacks, as much as they wanted, at a buffet where the exact quantities consumed could be weighed and caloric intake calculated. Then for the next two weeks, the participants ate a 200-calorie lunch, a commercially available food like a Kashi bar or a Lean Pocket. But the rest of the day, they ate whatever they wanted from the buffet. Not counting lunch, the participants consumed 1,568 calories on days they had the 200-calorie lunch and 1,560 on days when they did not — an insignificant difference. But over all, they consumed 245 fewer calories on low-calorie lunch days. The result of that — unsurprisingly — was weight loss: an average of 1.1 pounds per participant in two weeks. “Most people believe there is a set point for body weight,” said David A. Levitsky, the lead author of the report and a professor of nutrition at Cornell University. “The prevailing notion is that if you create a deficit, you’re going to make up for it later. In this study, we found no evidence of any compensation.” A version of this article appears in print on September 6, 2011, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Nutrition: A Low-Calorie Meal Is Shown to Pay Off.
