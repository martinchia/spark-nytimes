Most people with diabetes worry about the effect the disease has on their bodies. But what about the effect it has on their relationships? More than 20 million people in the United States have diabetes, and the damage it causes to their bodies, including impeded blood flow to arteries and reduced stamina, often impacts patients’ sex lives. Yet many never discuss their unique romantic concerns with doctors. A new book from the American Diabetes Association attempts to remedy that. “Sex and Diabetes” takes a frank and sensible look at the intimate lives of people with the disease.  By some estimates, from 50 percent to 80 percent of men with diabetes suffer from erectile dysfunction. A strong erection requires healthy veins and unobstructed blood flow, something many people with diabetes lack. Less is known about the sexual effects in women, although experts say women with diabetes often lose their libidos or suffer from vaginal dryness, which can lead to painful intercourse. Co-author Janis Roszler, a nutritionist, tells the story of one woman who felt guilty about having diabetes and believed her husband no longer loved her. âI brought diabetes into our life,ââ she cried to Ms. Roszler. “Itâs changed how we eat; itâs changed how we go out. He should be with someone else.” The fear that diabetes is interfering with a relationship isn’t uncommon, says Ms. Roszler. One of the first strategies for managing diabetes is to change the way a person eats. But our relationships are intimately tied to food consumption â candlelight dinners signal courtship, while large family dinners woo teens to the table. It’s no wonder people with diabetes worry their relationships will change as their diets do. The book begins with a quiz to help readers determine if diabetes is interfering with their sex lives. It explains how diabetes affects the body and contains chapters for men and women that explain ways to combat sexual problems. It includes advice on talking to your doctor and even offers diabetes-approved recipes for romantic mornings and evenings, such as banana-ginger muffins and a chocolate log dessert. Ms. Roszler says she hopes the book shows people that there are answers for the sexual and relationship problems that often accompany diabetes. “People do better health-wise when they have family support,” said Ms. Roszler. “If there is stress in the bedroom, that permeates the rest of their lives.” Comments are no longer being accepted. I think John Mellencamp was channeling a middle-aged diabetic man when he wrote that classic line in his hit song Jack & Diane, “Oh yeah life goes on….
Long after the thrill of livin is gone.” Diabetes isn’t cancer, isn’t Parkinsons, but it generally screws with most aspects of a person’s life. It is a double edge sword that lets you live a long time with a serious disease, but looked at another way, lets you have decades of disruption and upset before it kills you slowly and in a horrible manner.  The first 50 years of a man’s life is all about sex. I’m currently trying to figure out how to live like a Catholic priest, not something I prepared for or wanted in the least. I spend too much time thinking about the old movie, Logan’s Run….well, all of it minus the love scenes. I’ve had Type One diabetes since I was 11 years old, forty-five years ago.  It affects everything in your life, especially prior to the last ten or fifteen years over which it has become an industry with all the attached technologies.  Type One also plays with your psychology (i.e. the romance prior to sex) depending upon sugar levels. But having spoken to many doctors and patients over the years, I’d say that no more than 10% do what is necessary to treat the disease properly or avoid complicatons, sexual or otherwise.  One doctor laughingly told me that it would be easier to get Americns to change their sexual orientations than change their diets.  Point taken.  Simply, if you take care of yourself, you’ll have fewer problems, especially with those suffering from (I’m sorry to say) the much less debilitating Type Two diabetes. Rule #1:  Stop %$&^#7! eating!  Do what you must, then live with the results.  If you can’t, then stop whining.  My neighbor has a child with Cerebral Palsey.  Watching that little boy makes me realize how lucky I am. Any chronic illness is apt to change the lives not only of the “patients” but also of the families, and this one is as bad as any.  No matter how well you think you’re handling it, it’s easy to get downhearted.   First it makes you tired, and it’s a tiredness that just doesn’t go away with a decent nights sleep. Then you have to change everything you eat (including, and let’s be honest here, giving up a lot of things you and your family like), and either watching while they grudgingly give up these things too (bad for everyone) or REFUSE to give up these things (bad for you.) Then, if and when you progress to insulin, you get the distinct displeasure of having to figure how to take a shot in public, preferably under a table cloth, whenever you go OUT to eat (disheartening) or even worse, having to take a shot in some (usually filthy) bathroom.  Yuck! Throw in a few extra years, a little bit of arthritis, and is it any wonder it killes “romance? To me diabetes is not a problem for sex, because sex is all in the mind. They make little blue pills for the the physical issues. For men. When will they make one for females also? as one ages the drive is what declines. Who could imagine a couple in their Winter acting like a couple of Spring Chickens, in heat? Death is the only answer. Letâs face it, we Baby Boomers are seeing our bodies give way to problems we once thought were the domain of earlier generations. Between the hearing going (thank you, multi-decibel rock concerts), our knees giving out (miles of running had to catch up to us eventually) and everything hurting (oh letâs face, weâre getting old), now weâre coping with issues of diabetes that can come with the extra years and poundage. For a generation that prides itself on caring deeply about relationshipsânot such a bad thingâcoping with diabetes can take a real toll when it comes to life with our significant others. Good to know this new book addresses topics that, up until now, have been unmentionable. I’m a Type 2 (for twenty years) who is new to insulin. I have found that the combination of pills, long-lasting insulin, and regular light exercise have enabled me to finally get this under much better control. Cutting food portions and adding a small meal helps as well. Living alone helps even more. Perhaps seconding Charlie’s comments , I believe we should be careful to distinguish between Type One and Type Two diabetes.  You’d never know it from most of the media coverage of diabetes, but unlike most Type Two diabetics, whose disease results at least in part from lifestyle, many Type One diabetics are in excellent condition.  Unfortunately, the level of vigilance required to maintain the “tight” control known to reduce the likelihood of the many possible complications can split you into two people over time, even if you do succeed in keeping your glucose levels in a narrow range close to normal.  First, never sleeping even when you sleep, there is the full-time internalized nurse or mathematician, always measuring blood sugar levels against activity, food intake, amount of insulin injected, and many other factors; always asking you how you’re feeling, observing your every sensation and though, wondering whether a shimmery sensation along the spine might be a sign of rising and falling sugar, whether a sudden irritability or moment of stupidity is tied to a substantive change in sugar level.   Second, there is the “real” you, the one trying to act spontaneously with a loved one, to enter the moment, to just “be.” It can be done, but not always, not easily, not often. And you will make mistakes, some of them very unpleasant: for example, if you miscalculate, take too much insulin or too little food, and your sugar level starts to fall in an unexpected way, you may move in the space of a few minutes from great desire to being soaked in sweat, trembling, a cold hand clutching at your heart. The feeling of going into shock is never pleasant. It leaves you with a headache, bad nerves, exhaustion for the entire next day sometimes. The adrenaline charge can be hard to forget, for you or for your partner, no matter how you play it down. The bitterest irony is that the low sugar is often the direct result of the tight control required to avoid such complications as erectile dysfunction, blindness, etc.  We are adaptable, and one gets better at avoiding such events, one stops feeling bitter and does find moments of real connection and forgetfulness. Unfortunately, the costs of all this effort and self-consciousness are very high on a psychological level, and the temptation is often to retreat into a more defensive posture in all things, to live cautiously, to not let oneself be “carried away” by desire, feeling, events, whatever.  I could have used some help with this in my early years as a Type One diabetic, in my late twenties. Now, in my early 40s, I’ve figured a lot of it out for myself. At the same time, I know there are many surprises still in store, including possible complications. Too bad endocrinologists spend so much of their time treating the symptoms of Type Two diabetics as the number of obese people in this country continues to rise; I’ve never met an endocrinologist who understood how to speak to me about any of this in a compassionate, complex, realistic way. “Pity the nation whose breath is money and sleeps the sleep of the too well fed…” (Ferlinghetti)  Endless whining about actually having to examine and restrain our disgustingly excessive, self obsessed lifestyles.  In the completely corporate, intellectually challenged medium of the New York Times.  It’s enough to make you lose your appetite. It seems that most discussions of the effects of diabetes concerns two things: eyes and feet.  I.e., that diabetes results in blindness and/or neuropathy.  There are other systems effected by the disease, however. In my case, it was my hearing.  Diabetes-related deafness is not uncommon, but it’s something you rarely hear about (no pun intended).  Blindness and neuropathy may be the most common conditions and thus may be the most often mentioned, but I have shown no signs of either at this point.  The hearing loss, however, is very real. I mentioned this to my doctor at a physical, and then cited a line from Tom Wolfe’s “The Right Stuff”: “It could blow at any seam.”  My doctor chuckled appreciatively, and it’s still a good summation of the effects of diabetes on the body. It is a lifetime challenge and it’s both your own behavior and finding the right medication balances.  One of the reasons that I don’t talk about the struggles is because it is not like cancer or having a child with cerebal palsy.  But it can take over your life and you just get tired of keeping up with the challenges. Sometimes you do need to whine and complain so you can get past the stress of all of the stuff you have to do and the frustration of your own failures. Then you can look at the glass half full and not half empty. I’ve had type 2 diabetes for nearly 30 years and take insulin.  I respect the disease but do not allow it to control my life.  I’ve always taken very good care of myself with a good diet & exercise and enjoy overall excellent health.  I’ve never had any sexual dysfunction but my soon to be ex-husband has been impotent for nearly 15 years due to his smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and all the drugs he takes for these conditions.  I’m happy to report that this purgatory will soon end and happier to report that my libido is raging and intercourse is not only not painful, but is fabulous.  I guess it’s like riding a bike – you never forget once you learn. As a type 1 diabetic for the last 21 years and now in my late twenties, it’s about time that people start talking about the impact of diabetes on everyday life.  It’s more than just meal plans and medications — this disease has touched my life since I was six years old, from birthday parties to today, as I’m planning my wedding.  Books like this one answer questions that some are just too afraid to ask.  Thank you to Janis and Donna for their honest approach to a topic that some still consider taboo.  — Kerri Morrone of //www.sixuntilme.com Despite the protestations of all those who have managed to escape some (obvious)disease or condition so far, everyone dies of something. Just a matter of time. I was diagnosed with Type 1 in 1969, when I was 18. Under good control, no significant complications and leading a full life (work, play, travel), with no restrictions. As a current television ad says, “You are the cure” when it comes to diabetes. You choose what you eat and when you eat. And believe me, today’s insulins and technologies (I wear an insulin pump) give one a lot more flexibility than the good old days of trying to guess when insulin was going to peak and what you would be doing. As far as the love life goes, everything is working fine — at age 56. Unfortunately, I find the attitudes of others to be the biggest hurdle. After they see or read the crap in some ads or listen to anecdotes about some relative or friend who faced amputations, blindness, ED, or worse, it’s been my experience that most women (and some men)either head for the hills or treat you like you’re dying.  Funny thing is eventually some of those folks had their own health problems to worry about. Some aren’t even around anymore. There are many health conditions much more difficult to live with than Type 1 diabetes. konaray After you go through all the diet and lifestyle changes then you get to deal with the complications brought on by the disease. My wife mishandled her condition and 20 years later she is losing parts of her feet, battling infections, nerve damage to her legs, kidney failure and that’s all I can think of at the moment. I get to ferry her to and from hospitals and doctors as a second job. Romance? That was gone 10 years ago. At 57 I am really at a loss as how to relate to her any more.

TPP responds: I so appreciate the frankness and honesty of your post. It’s a sad story but an important one for everyone to hear. To VA_lady, isn’t there technology now that allows you to avoid doing shots in dirty bathrooms or under the table cloth?  I have a friend who has a pager-sized machine that injects him at regular intervals without him having to do anything.  He can adjust the amount it injects in case he eats more than planned, or less, and he can test himself quickly from the same machine. I agree that venting or complaining or educating is so important.  We used to have to utter “cancer” under our breath, but diabetes is still stigmatized because it is misunderstood.  And, as many have pointed out, having Type 1 has nothing to do with a person’s behavior.  Of course, even if Type 2 does have to do with behavior, does that mean we shouldn’t have compassion and seek understanding? Should we ignore people who contract HIV through irresponsible behavior?  Of course not! I understand how the non-diabetic partner feels.  My husband, although not obese nor overweight, has complained about his weight gain.  I am petite and I am one of those people who can eat anything but will not gain much weight – at most three pounds before I can feel a certain mechanism kick in.  I start to lose my appetite and go back to my original weight.  Perhaps I just also have a high metabolic rate.   My husband is not a glutton but he certainly can pack away food whereas I eat small portions but more frequently.  Thus he decided that we should eat more vegetarian dishes and so I have been preparing more of these dishes.  First of all, it’s a lot more work to constantly prepare vegetarian meals, in my experience.  Secondly, I found I need to eat more meat than he does.  I just can feel the energy is not there but in deference to his wishes, we’ve had more vegetarian food.  I just feel I have lost a lot of interest in the meals now because of this change.  The food quality is not to blame – I am a bit of a gourmet cook – but I just feel I was happier and more adjusted when I had a more balanced diet. Well said, Andrew.  Those of us with one of the later onset varieties of T1, or T 1 1/2, or T2 get to cope with this for fewer years, but as you say, you never ever get to put it out of your mind.   You can’t afford to throw caution to the winds, or forget for very long.  The consequences are too dangerous. Keeping your blood glucose in tight control means monitoring food, exercize, wellness, fluids, alcohol and sometimes I swear the phase of the moon.  Am I sleepy because I’m tired, or because my glucose is too high?  Am I cranky and irritable because I’m tired, because my boss really is a fool, or because I took too MUCH insulin and my glucose is too low?  Am I losing my ability to “sense” when my glucose is dropping too fast?   Take too little insulin and you have a cracker of a headache (a romance killer); take too much and you have a “crash”; mix with alcohol and fall asleep and if it’s bad enough you may not ever wake up. These are not the sort of thoughts that go away easily. Diabetes runs in my family as far back as anyone can guess. My older brother died from the illness, because he didn’t take care of himself basically. My mother has diabetes. My great grand father had diabetes and died of a heart attack. My cousin has diabetes. And so on… First, many insurance companies will not pay for proper medication. They pay for pills or the older insulin when something like Lantus is much better. I would just avoid the insurance co and buy the best medicines. Second, carpa diem!! Sieze the day!! This does not mean live wild and crazy. Unlike most people, we know our medical and financial futures with near certainity. Therefore, we do not have the time or luxury of discounting the future and sticking our heads in the sand. This means all parts of our lives must be managed with diabetes as one of the major variables. Save more today for the tragedies that will come. Spend time and resources on things that make both our families and ourselves healthy and happy today. Third, lucky for us we live in the time of viagra! Ask your doctor and use it if healthy and safe. Also, if folks have a family history of diabetes then choosing a spouse should be something more than mere happen stance. Some spouses will be much better then others when this illness strikes. One would be wise to consider all that is implied in this assertion. The sacrafices are many so anyone not devoted to the traditional idea of family raises questions in my book. Fourth, every diabetic I know follows the mantra, diet, exercise and medication. I have found that simply rearranging one’s life works better. For example, we chose a house with two flights of stairs. I walk whenever I get a chance. Sometimes I park one or two extra blocks away just to get a little exercise. Talk to your doctor and discover your daily caloric needs. Treat this like money. Spend it on various food varieties while sampling the various food groups. Eat five or six times per day but much smaller portions at each meal. Or eat three regular meals with a couple of fruit and veggie breaks. In the old days people referred to diabetes as the RICH GUY’S illness, because it seems to strike those who are less active. Hence, lead a more active life style. Humans were made for activity not mere idleness. I could go on, but good luck to all. If you even slightly suspect that you may have diabetic symptons then go to the doctor! Robert
Washington, DC What a self-perpetuating market… the food industry contributes significantly to our wellness [or lack of it] and the pharmaceudical industry comes up with a symptoms fix that oftentimes produces yet a completely different issue.  What bothers me most about this vicious cycle is that consumers are the victims. One must spend countless hours if they are determined to find truthful and accrate information on foods these days. After both partners work all day to make ends meet they’re too tired to get to the bottom of the matter.  I cringe when I see advertising or even suggestions that Aspartame, Splenda, etc. are choices as a sugar substitute – especially for those with diabetes. For what it’s worth to readers, Blue Agave is a low glycemic sweetener – however, one must choose an Agave from the correct species. The best species is Agave tequilana, if that species is not listed on the label then you’ll be getting a a sweetener from a species that isn’t helpful. A book I believe is right on the money is, Choose Your Foods Like Your Life Depends On Them, by Dr. Colleen Huber, NMD. Here’s a little excerpt I found from an article in the chapter “Food as Medicine”:  âWe live at a strange crossroads in history. Over the last few decades, the human species has been hypnotized by the temptations offered by the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. The 1950âs ushered in the ‘better living through chemicals’ age. And we believed, and we bought and swallowed and injected and are still consuming them in massive amounts, and, most recklessly, injecting such chemicals as ethylene glycol (antifreeze), aluminum and formaldehyde into our babies as part of vaccines, without any prior safety testing. But now with massive chronic disease plaguing our most industrialized populations, autism closely following childrenâs shots, and more pathology coincident with concentrated chemicals, we are beginning to wake up from our long post-World War II slumber. Now begins the next era when synthetic chemicals are starting to be seen as, however useful in many applications, best kept at a distance from our bodies, our homes, public spaces and wilderness. The old era of unthinking reliance on a synthetic existence is showing severe disadvantages, just as the urgency to forge new relationships with nature is becoming apparent. Plants and other whole foods are coming into their own new era as naturopathic physicians and other well-informed health practitioners rely on them for their central role in healing. Within our lifetimes, natural substances will eclipse pharmaceuticals in medical practice, as the general public awakens to its far superior healing capacity. But the pharmaceutical industry will be the slowest to catch on.” âLet food be your medicine and medicine be your food.â – Hippocrates Clearly Hippocrates had no idea what would happen in the food industry! #16, “failed vegetarian”–my goodness. You’re not a failed anything. You’re a woman who has learned how to eat properly for her body. If your husband wants to try being a veggie, let him cook for himself. Though it may not work best for a man who gains weight easily to eat all those carbs.  I am also a petite woman who has learned I MUST eat a meat-and-low-carb-veggies diet. No grains, no dairy, no starch.  To each her own. And take care of her own needs first. First, VA_Lady2007, do I ever know what you are talking about! I feel as though since being diagnosed with Type 1 right before my 21st birthday (talk about ruining my fun!) and I feel like I am so much more hyper aware of my body now. No feeling or emotion is a regular one anymore, it may be tied to a high number, a low one, or dropping or rising. Am I even ME anymore, now that I am diabetic? Am I diabetic first, then Sarah? Its a fine line.  Also, to Aaron, the “pager-sized device” is an insulin pump. This can be upwards of a 6,000-7,000 dollar machine, not to mention that monthly supplies cost around 300-400 dollars or more. If you don’t have insurance, this is nearly impossible unless of course you have the good fortune to spend that kind of money. Also, just because I can, it doesn’t “inject” all the time, insulin seeps in through a catheter after being injected one time under your skin. Truly a remarkable advance in technology. I couldn’t imagine life without it. Also, to address the article, I am 24 years old and in a “serious” relationship. I worry about my future, will I have my legs, my eyes, will I be able to sense touch, etc. I worry about him, too, because I would feel terrible if he became my babysitter because I couldn’t find the strength to change my habits and improve my blood sugar readings. Being Type 1 has been tough sometimes, because I become hair-triggered when a little high or low. (lucky him!) and a few times we’ve had to stop in the middle of sex because I realized I was experiencing hypoglycemia. It’s very hard to re-kindle that moment afterwards because there is a certain recovery time, then you have to make sure your blood sugar is rising, then you have to make sure you don’t “work too hard” because your blood sugar may drop again! Boy, am I sure glad the boyfriend is patient! Take care of yourselves, everyone. What non-diabetics do not understand is that diabetes is much more than checking your sugar and taking injections. It requires a level of vigilance that is difficult to maintain, and disruptive to the rest of one’s life. Diabetes is not a painful disease, but it an exhausting one. You don’t get a holiday from diabetes. I know that my Type 1 diabetes is not the most difficult disease in the world, but it is awfully upsetting when I choose to forgo dessert only to overhear a Type 2 diabetic say, “Oh, I’ll just take more pills.” Type 1s do not have the option to abuse their bodies like that. We are the canaries in the mine. As the spouse of a type 1 diabetic I would like to remind folks that sex is about more than intercourse.    Although the disease has taken away that option, we enjoy many alternate ways to pleasure each other.  My husband, age 50, is still a man to whom sex is important and I find him very sexy.  I might have to put in a little more effort than when he was 35, and we don’t do “it” the same way, but sex is still an important part of our loving marriage.  We’ll just keep adapting to whatever happens until death parts us! I was aware of his health issue and potential for    complications when we married. Yep, he may become blind or have other difficult complications.  But I may get breast cancer or dementia.  Who knows?
We love each other for who we are not our medical dossier.  I try to provide healthy food, he manages his health, and we live our everyday lives. MN Wife Thank you for these illuminating comments. Though I am not diabetic, about 10% of the people in my state are diabetic, so these comments help me better understand many people I encounter each day.   I see that I need to be more sensitive to the way this condition can affect their emotions and behavior and, even, health insurance requirements. I might add something from my own experience which might be of interest.  Like many people, I try to follow a low-fat and low-sugar diet for weight and other health reasons.  Since high-fat and high-sugar foods are often part of social occasions, I have noticed, over the years, that I am more comfortable around diabetic people who avoid some of these foods and focus on conversation, instead of food.  I don’t long for these foods, but I can never seem to satisfy some people why I choose not to eat them.  So it is nice not to have to explain those food choices to others who make similar food choices. To the “Failed Vegetarian” – you are not a failure, you just haven’t figured out what works best for you. I became a vegetarian for ethical reasons many years ago, and at first, struggled with how to replace the protein in my diet.  There are a number of good meat substitutes – burgers, chicken, and ‘crumbles’ which are like ground beef or sausage.  My non-vegetarian husband has grown to enjoy that kind of stuff; it sounds like you have the same tastes he does; some people just really enjoy it (I’ve read that some people are more pre-disposed to need meat more than others, based on their genetic heritage.)  Have you considered eating meat with your lunches instead of your dinners?  You should not have to give up entirely on meat. Perhaps a compromise is in order? Anyway, the fake meat is great for when you don’t have much time to plan a meal – pair it with some steamed veggies or low-fat cottage cheese and a salad.  Also, check out Allrecipes.com or a similar website – you may be surprised at the number of easy-to-make filling dinners. There are also a number of “easy” vegetarian cookbooks – my husband had never cooked much more than a can of soup before we got together, but he has learned to make fantastic meals.  Maybe this is something you and your husband could do together? Good luck to you – and this goes for all of you who are caring for someone – You do the best you can and that’s all anyone can expect.  Kudos to all of you and best wishes. Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
