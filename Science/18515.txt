Exposure to pesticides may increase the risk for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrigâs disease, a new study has found. The study, in JAMA Neurology, included 156 patients with A.L.S. and 128 controls. All participants completed questionnaires providing information on age, sex, ethnicity, education, marital status, residential history, occupational history, smoking and military service. The researchers used the information on residence and occupation to estimate long-term exposure to pesticides, and then took blood samples to determine serum levels of 122 persistent environmental pollutants. The scientists divided exposure into four time periods: ever exposed, exposed in the last 10 years, exposed 10 to 30 years ago, and exposed more than 30 years ago. Exposure to pesticides at any time was associated with a fivefold increased relative risk for A.L.S. compared to no exposure. Even exposure more than 30 years ago tripled the risk. Military service was associated with double the risk, confirming findings of previous studies. âThis is an association, not causality,â cautioned the senior author, Dr. Eva L. Feldman, a professor of neurology at the University of Michigan. âWe found that people with A.L.S. were five times more likely to have been exposed to pesticides, but we donât want people to conclude that pesticides cause A.L.S.â Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
