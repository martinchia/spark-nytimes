 It hurts plenty when someone, say, bonks you on the head with a badminton racket. But it hurts even more, researchers have found, if you think the bonking was no accident. Earlier studies have found that the perception of pain can change with how it is experienced. That is why giving people sugar pills and saying they are medicine can make them feel better, the researchers note. But in this case, the perception made the pain worse, the researchers report in the current issue of Psychological Science. The authors are Kurt Gray, a Harvard graduate student, and Daniel M. Wegner, a psychology professor. For the study, the researchers told more than 40 volunteers that they were going to do a series of tasks, including color matching, number estimation and “discomfort assessment.” This last task involved their receiving a brief electric shock to the wrist.

In some cases, the volunteers were told their partner had chosen the pain tolerance test. In others, they were told the computers would select the pain tolerance test regardless of their partner’s choice.
