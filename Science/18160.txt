 To the Editor: The pressure on students to get into an elite college (Well, April 29) extends all the way to middle school. At a recent open house for a school in Los Angeles, we were shown a slide of five boys playing water polo. The caption read, simply and cynically, “Harvard, Stanford, Princeton, Stanford, Stanford.” That’s where the boys had parlayed their newfound love of water sports. Admission to private middle school in many major cities has become as cutthroat as any college contest. Maybe we should give ourselves — and our children — a break and remember the real value of education: to nurture decency, curiosity, responsibility and a sense of perspective. Jessica TeichPacific Palisades, Calif.  To the Editor: I can attest to the sense of worthlessness felt by millions of high school seniors this spring. As I received my rejection letters from Tufts, Brown and Columbia, I wondered if there was any more I could have done in high school, because apparently, at the age of 17, I have not proved myself or my worth enough to the world. For the past month, I have felt crushed and unsatisfactory. But I am excited to be participating in a college-leadership program in Israel next year, before I attend Brandeis University on a scholarship. I only hope the universities that rejected me will one day benefit from a paper I publish once I sufficiently “prove myself.” Hannah Victoria GoldbergWest Chester, Pa.
