 Doctors from  Hunan Province in China are reporting a syndrome that might be described as modern medicine meeting “The Joy Luck Club.” The patient they describe in a letter to the medical journal Lancet  was a 40-year-old woman with painful swelling in her left leg. While her blood tests were normal, an ultrasound showed deep-vein thrombosis, a dangerous blood clot. She was hospitalized for two weeks on intravenous blood thinners and aspirin while wearing compression stockings. She recovered, and is on maintenance therapy with warfarin, a blood thinner. She had no health problems or family history of thrombosis, and only one known risk factor, birth-control pills. Ultimately, the diagnosis the doctors came up with was “mah-jongg-related deep-vein thrombosis.” They noted that she had spent eight hours sitting motionless the previous night playing the ancient Chinese tile game mah-jongg so intently that all she consumed was “a small amount of soft drink.” “Our patient’s condition is similar to ‘economy-class syndrome’ in its underlying pathophysiological mechanisms,” they wrote. “However, the mechanisms of mah-jongg-related D.V.T. could be complicated by stress (especially when it involves monetary bets) and sleep deprivation.” A version of this article appears in print on July 6, 2010, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: CHINA: A Dangerous Blood Clot Is Linked To Hours Sitting and Playing a Game.
