 TO THE EDITOR: Re “Breast-Feeding Services Lag the Law” (Oct. 1): Twenty-three years ago, my insurance carrier refused to pay for a breast pump to provide my daughter, born at 29 weeks and in the NICU for 5 weeks, with breast milk. It seemed (and seems) ridiculous that the cost of formula was covered but not the cost of a breast pump to supply superior nutrition. I remember calling our carrier to appeal the denial, to no avail. Like Maryanne Conte, we paid out of pocket. It’s sad to see that so little has changed. Marian Amy Caplan, M.D. Owings Mills, Md. A version of this letter appears in print on October 8, 2013, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Support For Breast-Feeding.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
