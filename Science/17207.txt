 TO THE EDITOR: Re “What Does Birth Cost? Hard to Tell” (Essay, July 9): The fact that hospitals are not required to tell you the cost of a procedure until you receive the bill seems absurd and unethical. We are often referred to as “consumers of health,” which would imply that we, as consumers, are able to choose where to spend our money.
