I love my summer stir-fry weeks. The list of ingredients sometimes looks daunting, but think of the effort required to put a stir-fry together as family time. Start the rice, pour yourself a glass of wine, put others to work measuring and chopping, and visit while you prep. Once your mise en place is ready, have the others set the table while you make the stir-fry in under 10 minutes. You barely heat up the kitchen.  I was after Thai flavors in some of the stir-fries I made this week, because I had a beautiful bunch of Thai basil from the farmersâ market. To this end, I decided to cook a mix of sweet vegetables (corn, tomatoes, squash) in coconut oil, which Iâve never used for a stir-fry. The oil was perfect, adding a  rich but light coconut flavor. I will definitely use it again. I also used radishes and their greens in one recipe. I always feel silly throwing away those beautiful greens. They resemble turnip greens â slightly bitter â so I seasoned the dish with a sweet and sour sauce. Itâs now one of my favorite stir-fries and I know what I will do from now on when I have a bunch of radishes that arenât going to make it into a salad lingering in the refrigerator.  Stir-fried Rice With Amaranth or Red Chard and Thai Basil: This is another Thai-influenced dish, spiced with sriracha and featuring the beautiful green vegetable amaranth. Stir-Fried Beans With Tofu and Chiles: This crunchy, colorful stir-fry has an added kick from serrano chiles. Corn, Squash, Red Onion and Tomatoes Stir-Fried in Coconut Oil: Coconut oil gives this dish fragrance without heaviness. Stir-Fried Turkey Breast With Snap or Snow Peas and Chard: Turkey cutlets are easy to prep and cook quickly, and young snap peas can be almost as tender as the more traditional snow peas for stir-fries. Sweet and Sour Stir-Fried Radishes With Their Greens: The bitterness of radish greens pairs wells with a sweet-and-sour sauce in this stir-fry.
