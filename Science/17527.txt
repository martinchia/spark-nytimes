 THE FACTS In 2004, Teresa Heinz Kerry, the Mozambique-born heiress and wife of John Kerry, who was then running for president, advocated an unusual remedy for arthritis while discussing health care at a campaign stop in Nevada. “You get some gin and get some white raisins — and only white raisins — and soak them in the gin for two weeks,” she said. “Then eat nine of the raisins a day.” Although some people poked fun at the statement, Mrs. Heinz Kerry was repeating a popular folk remedy that has been around for decades. Countless  Web sites for arthritis sufferers mention it as a cure for pain, and several books on folk remedies promote it. But whether there is any real science behind it is an open question. To date, no rigorous studies have examined whether gin or raisins — together or alone — can ease arthritis symptoms. Grapes contain compounds called proanthocyanidins, which are thought to help fight infection and reduce inflammation. They also contain resveratrol, the powerful antioxidant that scientists say gives red wine many of its disease-fighting properties. Dr. Steven Abramson, the director of rheumatology at the New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases, said studies are looking at whether resveratrol and other substances in red wine can affect joint disease. But raisins are a poor source of resveratrol, which is usually destroyed when grapes are dried. And the Agriculture Department says levels of proanthocyanidins in raisins are “undetectable.” As for the gin, Dr. Abramson said, some people find it can help dull pain, but only in moderation. THE BOTTOM LINE There is no evidence that raisins soaked in gin have any particular effect on arthritis pain. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F5 of the New York edition.
