 To the Editor: “Twins on a Medical Odyssey After a Diagnosis of Diabetes” (Nov. 20)  informs readers about promising research that could prevent or delay Type 1 diabetes. What isn’t stated is that the program that is paying for this research may well be closed down unless Congress takes action by year’s end. The Special Diabetes Program accounts for more than a third of all federal Type 1 diabetes research. While Congressional support remains strong, the dwindling number of legislative days is making the chances of renewal uncertain. For people like Marissa Newman, let’s hope this holiday season provides them with their most important gift — a chance to keep beating Type 1 diabetes. Lawrence A.
