 A Brazilian cave insect has done a most unusual sex-role reversal, a new study finds: Females have penises, and males have vaginas. All four known species of the genus Neotrogla in Brazil have this anatomy, which has not been seen in any other animal, said Rodrigo Ferreira, a cave biologist at the Federal University of Lavras in Brazil and an author of the study, in the journal Current Biology. “We were completely shocked,” he said. The female’s penislike organ, called the gynosome, shown above, is erectable and inflates inside of the male’s vagina. Copulation lasts a very long time — 40 to 70 hours — and sperm is transferred from the male to the female. The researchers believe the reversal may have evolved because of the dark, nutrient-poor environment in the caves. To produce eggs, females may need to seek sperm simply for nourishment.

To confirm this hypothesis, he and his colleagues are raising and studying species of Neotrogla in the lab. But many of the caves where the insects are found are in danger from mining and the development of hydroelectric plants, Dr. Ferreira said.
