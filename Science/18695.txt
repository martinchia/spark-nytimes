I was reading today in The Times that organic food prices are rising. It reminded me of a really helpful list from the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization, about how to be a strategic shopper when buying organic fruits and vegetables. While there is an ongoing debate about whether buying organic food really makes a difference in terms of health, the reality is that some consumers choose organic foods because they want to lower their exposure to pesticides. For those shoppers, it makes sense to know when to buy organic and which conventionally-grown foods are good enough because they already are low in pesticide residue.  The Environmental Working Group tested dozens of fruits and vegetables to determine which foods are the worst offenders in terms of pesticide exposure. Some fruits and vegetables grown with conventional farming methods simply don’t absorb the pesticides. Some examples of vegetables and fruits with very low pesticide residues are onions, mangoes, asparagus, broccoli and eggplant. So whether you pick them up from the regular produce section or the organic aisle, your pesticide exposure is going to be low.  So if you are on a budget, focus your organic dollars where it counts — on foods that suck in a lot of pesticides when grown using conventional farming methods. Foods that typically have high levels of pesticide residue include peaches, strawberries, sweet bell peppers, celery and lettuce. To see the complete list of the 43 fruits and vegetables tested by the Environmental Working Group, click here. The site includes a printable chart of the dozen foods lowest in pesticide residue and those that are best purchased from the organic aisle. And to read the complete story about rising organic food prices reported by my colleagues Andrew Martin and Kim Severson, click here. Comments are no longer being accepted. Shouldn’t we also be concerned about the toxicity of soils, runoff, and groundwater – along with wildlife and the farm workers?  Many more people are affected by the use of “cides” other than the consumer. I don’t see any convincing evidence that large numbers of people are getting sick from these pesticides, but the info on fruit and vegetable pesticide load is appreciated. Hello everyone, As someone who has judiciously supported the whole organic movement since 1971, I have read widely and used every strategy, as “organic” food has always been more expensive.  This plan of action highlighted in the article above has always been one I used, as soon as I was receiving accurate information about the subject, usually thru Nutrition Action magazine from Center for Science in the Public Interest. Then, thankfully, over the years, the research is gradually being done, using Brix meters and other lab analysis, that does show that organic food has at least double the nutrition (sometimes much more than that) for usually 1  1/2 times the price (and that price gap is lowering, except for Whole Foods, as best I can see). That helps me “justify” my extra expenditure to my sometimes more-vocal family members. Apart from helping our own bodies (especially childrens’ — as their capacity for toxins is MUCH lower), we also have to stop the poisonous abuse of Mother Earth. She is the only home we have, and the numbers of tons of pesticides and fungicides dumped on her annually are monumental. It’s crazy! We also need to have the USDA suddenly make a 180 degree change and “fine” non-organic farmers, in my opinion, especially hitting-in-the-pocketbook the huge percentage of acreage now under the control of big-factory farming. I also encourage more people to have their own gardens. That will help you a great deal on many fronts – economically, healthwise, civil defense etc. etc. Learn to garden. There’s an initial investment of money, time and energy, but after that, as long as you water and fertilize with organic fertilizer, your garden will repay you many times over. With the excess, you can also help to feed needy people. I think a movement to get gardens started at every place of worship and every schoolyard could change the face of hunger in America, and I think it could teach respect for Mother Earth in the best and most long-lasting way. Chef Alice Waters has had such a program started as the Edible Schoolyard. You can find her website. I thank Tara for showing us an online, updated way to get the information about most toxic, sprayed foods, and I will be using this resource on my continued strategy to use my organic-food dollars wisely, especially as my budget for many things is shrinking fast in this economy. But, as I have said before on this blog, after shelter, quality food comes next. Make sure your priorities are carefully thought out, too. Best to all — Em

“Everyone knows someone who needs this information!” (TM) Though some choose to buy organic because it does not (or most likely will not) contain pesticides, the true health value of organic is masked by this focus on pesticides.  Organic protocols encourage the health of the plant (so that pesticides are less necessary). A healthy plant contains higher levels and variety of nutrients which humans (and animals) need to stay healthy.  An increasing number of peer reviewed, scientific studies are proving that organic food is healthier because it contains more polyphenols and antioxidants than conventional or genetically modified (GMO) foods.  ( see //www.organic-center.org/science.nutri.php). I agree with the previous comment about some of the more salient, and evidence-based reasons to support organic production as consumers. While I find EWG’s lists of the worst fruits and vegetables to buy with pesticides helpful, we should be careful not to imply that it is then “fine” to buy other produce that has not been produced organically, simply because it may effect our health less. The peel of a banana or avocado does not protect the farm worker or his/her family who is forced to inhale the toxic dust of pesticides that are travel the short distance from the fields to their on-farm home. agreed, we should be concerned about more than just ourselves when we choose to buy organic and local foods. I don’t think that anyone is saying that it’s fine to just but the low-pesticide foods, or that people using the list are only concerned about themselves. The truth is that produce is expensive, and organic produce is more expensive. For people who want to eat a variety of fruits and vegetables while supporting organic (and local!) farmers, but cannot afford to buy exclusively organic produce this list is very helpful in prioritizing.  Of the fruits and veggies I buy on a regular basis, I have been buying organic carrots and peppers but others are conventional. I’m getting ready to start growing my own lettuce and spinach (thanks to a shady patio) and based on the list, I will use the savings to upgrade my apples to organic. I care a lot about the environment, local and global, but it just is not feasible to buy all organic all the time on my budget and still get all the fruits and veggies I need. I think I need to do more reading on organic, because I am still a little skeptical (and admittedly not well informed).  But it sounds like it comes down to three issues: do the pesticides hurt us?  do they hurt the environment? and do organic foods for other reason have more nutrients?  Actually, one other thing I am wondering, what about natural pesticides?  I have heard those mentioned before.  And what about crop yield?  I remember one article from England saying organic produced as much, but does not using pesticides subject us to more risk of famine is some critters do get to food? The New Cook very helpful guide for those of us who can’t afford to always buy organic As helpful as organic can be, it is not enough, and it’s time to start focusing on more progressive actions. Organic has gone big industrial too, and while at least it is a bit better, it is not the solution. Also, be aware that the use of the word “organic” is under fire. Chicken farmers came very close to being able to call their chicken organic even if they weren’t feeding them organic feed. Huh? How does that make sense? And new fertilizers and pesticides are somehow getting “organic” labels, which is a complete bastardization of the term. And beware of those processed foods now proliferating through our stores as organic, in the end they are still processed. Yes, grow your own food as much as you can. A few years ago I grew cucumbers, tomatoes, and zucchinis in the 15-gallon black containers that nurseries have leftover from their tree deliveries. You could do this in the smallest yards or on a patio or balcony.  And go to your farmers markets. But be sure to ask if their farms are local and if their produce is their own. You’d be amazed that sometimes the answer is “no.” Support a local farm through CSA. Go to U-Pick-It farms and orchards. Get to know the seasons and what’s available. Ask yourself if an apple from New Zealand in February is worth the petroleum usage. Use your freezer to save summer’s goodies. If you can put veggies up in cans, more power to you.  Make like your grandma, it’s the best way to go. Pesticides contain xenoestrogens — chemical substances that mimic certain hormones in the body and upset the functioning of the body’s endocrine system. Excessive xenoestrogens can leads to lots of health problems, including cancer (they get stored in the body’s fatty tissue). Here is an excellent article about xenoestrogens and women’s health:
//www.womentowomen.com/detoxification/endocrinedisruptors.aspx I agree with the pp who said there needs to be some kind of worldwide movement to populate schools, churches, etc. with their own organic garden. Here, here! I’ve been using the EWG organic guide for a long time, but have decided that supporting LOCALLY PRODUCED FOODS comes first.  I cannot always find locally grown fruits, veggies, meat, grains or dairy.  But here’s how I make my decisions:
Local (within 100 miles) organic
Local conventional
Regional (within 300 miles) organic
Regional conventional
Organic when possible (fresh, affordable with minimal packaging), but many of these organic brands are now part of large industrial food farms, so don’t picture a small farm with grass-fed animals roaming in a pastural setting!  These large farms often push the organic standards to the edge, and the food travels an average of 1500 miles to the store.  But as we celebrate Earth Day we should think about these things:
  Nutrition: Foods that are locally grown taste  better and are higher in nutrition!  They last longer in the refrigerator.
  Sustainability:  Mono-cropping and hybrid plants that are used on industrial farms are vulnerable, so we need to support local agriculture that uses plants adapted to our geographical area. ASK where foods are grown and produced. Check out farm ethics.
  Packaging: Buy products with minimal packaging,  and take your own cloth bags to the store (they are stronger and easier to carry). Check to make sure packaging is recyclable and then YOU recycle it. And, most of all, eat more foods that look like when they came off the tree, out of the ground, and directly from the animal.  These are called whole foods.   When you do buy something that has already been prepared for you, read the labels and ingredients lists.  You will find that many processed, packaged foods are mixtures of chemicals with nutrients added, and that takes more ENERGY.  Pick the one with the fewest ingredients.  Eating responsibility for our earth and our health takes more time, but it’s not so hard after you do it for awhile. I just do the best I can,  knowing that even ONE earth-friendly decision is better than none.  ellie@feedingthekids.com In the Omnivore’s Dilemma, Michael Pollan shows that organic fruits and vegetables contain more vitamins and antioxidants than their factory-farmed counterparts. I do not work raising food crops for a living, but I do work in horticulture.  When we think of reducing pesticide exposure, it isn’t just food crops that are sometimes coated in pesticides.  We use MANY pesticides to produce the pretty little innocent flowers you buy when you go to your local garden center or home improvement store every spring.  My job is to keep our crops healthy in the greenhouses–I see every week how much pesticide is used in this sort of production. I see that sometimes people get sick from being exposed to the pesticides (you can protect as much as possible and still have someone who is sensitive that gets sick).  As I see it now, we’ll never get away from using a fair amount of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers; we force plants–living things!–to grow in very artifical ways (mono-cropping, manipulating lighting or heating to get flowers early/late, chemically controlling plant growth to give them more “retail appeal” and so no).  I do feel that many producers can do far more to reduce the pesticides and other chemicals (fertilizers, etc) used–many of these steps are not even that difficult (a.k.a. integrated pest management).  I am guilty myself of getting lazy and making poor decisions on pesticides to use to âget the job doneâ.  However, consumers have to do their part as well–ask the store you shop at if they know which foods and flowers were grown with little or no pesticides.  I can guarantee that gets back to the wholesale level and causes change to happen. Keep asking, too, as sometimes change is slow to happen.  I see now, even in horticulture, producers are building all-organic greenhouses and selecting plants for their ability to be grown successfully in organic systems.  The more you ask AND purchase, the more the people/companies that produce your food and plants will respond, some will jump on the bandwagon right away and some will “wait & see” (meaning they’ll either go out of business or eventually get on board).  I think it is worth supporting organic or at least more sustainable agriculture.  I suppose this can be said for many things but Iâve been working in this field for almost 8 years, I would have never really bought into the whole organic eating thing until I had to personally make countless pesticide applications, using a variety of different pesticide concoctions.  Over time you cannot help but wonder how did we get to this place in agriculture? Is there a better way? Can I help change it? Posted by Dr. Mercola, How the Food Industry is Deceiving You. This

Organic is better because of the higher nutritional value – but if one cannot afford organic, then it is probably better to have fruit and vegetables non-organic than not at all!  And an idea for those people who, regarding veggies, barely go beyond ketchup: Try one new vegetable per month! Look around in the produce aisle for rutabaga, leeks, golden beets, English peas, artichoke, celeriac. kale, parsnip, chard, Savoy cabbage, shallots, turnip, golden beets, bok choy…the list goes on and on.  And most vegetables taste delicious in olive oil and garlic.  Alexa Fleckenstein M.D., physician, author. I look forward to WELL posts and the many honest informative comments, but resent quack sites using these forums to shill, such as; ‘detoxifying cleanses’ and ‘nutrient packages’, from linked websites loaded with pseudo-medical sounding drivel about hormones.  It seems to me they are counter to what you’re attempting to do here, are they not Tara?

FROM TPP – Well the goal is always to empower readers with information to help them make decisions about their health. We should all do our homework and check out any health claim before acting on it. Intellectually, I know that organic is the healthiest and environmentally friendliest choice.  I have to say though, that feeding a family of five on organics is about breaking the bank. In the midst of all the political volleyball, I would love for a candidate to say that they would support legislation to reengineer the farming industry to support this very imporant long term agenda. I shop at the farmers’ market pretty much exclusively, except when I go on a tear and get chocoloate or a pack of that Ezekial 70-grain breadstoffe. I have been doing this for about three years–my essential diet consists of produce and coffee supplemented lightly with local eggs, dairy, beef and pork. Everything is organic except for the pork (it’s local). Everything is local except for nuts (essential to happiness), olive oil, spices, butter, coffee, chocolate and restaurant meals. If I eat fish, it’s usually because somebody caught it for me or because I’m I’m eating fried catfish. Eating farmers’market exclusively means there are some things I like that I don’t eat. For instance, I rarely eat bananas except on the rare occasions they show up at the market (I’m in Florida), and I never eat apples because apples don’t grow down here. I like apples, but I hate the grocery store more than I like apples. I hate the grocery store more than almost anything. Here’s the thrilling part:
I am not noticing that prices at the farmers’ market have changed, except for the milk and grass-fed beef: that has been rocketing up pretty staggeringly every couple of months for years, and that’s why I barely eat any. But eggs and strawberries and blueberries and red peppers and field peas and all suchlike premium items have gone up maybe fifty cents in the past year. Lettuce, greens, squash, onions, carrots, beets, sweet potatoes, corn, basil and pals, tomatoes, broccoli, cauliflower et al are all pretty much holding steady.  Because prices have held steady at the farmers’ market and I only rarely have to go to the grocery store for something like toilet paper or mayonnaise, I don’t suffer the weekly foodbill horrors others complain of. That and not contracting Parkinson’s disease from pesticide exposure  I count in the plus column. (//news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7318188.stm) In the minus column, you have to cook all this stuff. These health benefits everybody’s so excited about just mean I’ll live forfrikkinever. So I’ll be slaving over a hot pan of the green and leafies well into my nineties. Luckily I know when I get good and tired of the routine I can always adopt the Little Debby strategy for the short and sweet life. Your posting number 10, submitted by ‘buttercup’ on April 18,2008 says:  ‘Also, be aware that the use of the word âorganicâ is under fire. Chicken farmers came very close to being able to call their chicken organic even if they werenât feeding them organic feed. Huh? How does that make sense? And new fertilizers and pesticides are somehow getting âorganicâ labels, which is a complete bastardization of the term.’ I am reminded of what I learned in my college chemistry class around the time when the first Earth Day was celebrated…. ORGANIC defines a broad class of chemicals that contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Man-made substances composed of these elements are called “synthetic organics” whereas those occurring in nature are referred to as “natural organics”. The reason synthetic organics can be dangerous when consumed by a living organism is that the plant, animal, or human body does not recognize them as foreign and therefore has no appropriate way of dealing with them. At best, they are passed through the system without harm. At worst, they are immediately toxic.  Here is the complicating factor:  Many synthetic organics in use today are neither-nor. They often mimic naturally occurring compounds so that the organism mistakes them for the real thing and absorbs them blissfully. However, the results are usually detrimental to the organism, either to the same one that consumed them or to another one up the food chain.
Endocrine disruptors fall into this category. They do their harm qietly over longer periods of time and in smaller, less perceptible way. But the damage adds up over the months, years, decades, or a lifetime of exposure, possibly affecting entire generations.  So, when any product touts “organic”, always think/ask “natural or synthetic?” –Ro In response to Jack (post #2) that ‘I donât see any convincing evidence that large numbers of people are getting sick from these pesticides': give it time. I received a lab report of a chlorinated pesticide panel done on an adipose (fat) tissue sample taken at my sixth and most recent surgery for cancer and discovered that I had high levels of DDE (the major metabolite of DDT) in my body (I’m in my 40’s, and grew up in California eating plenty of treated fruits and vegetables).
The cause and effect of chemical toxicity on our bodies is neither immediate or simple to prove. However, there is simply no doubt in my mind that the rising levels of cancer are a direct result of the proliferation of poisons in out air, water and food- not to mention every day cleaning and personal care products.
Especially for children’s developing bodies, organic is critical and worth the extra dollars. That it tastes better is just further justification! FYI Organic food isn’t always more expensive. You can’t buy an individual carrot at the tradional grocery store. but at the organic section, or the organic store, you can buy just one. Same with brussel sprouts, strawberries, potatos,etc.  Big-Box grocers force you to buy a package of fruits or veggies, leading you to waste the extra 3/4 that you don’t need. But they make their money off you. So do both. For bulk items, go big-box. For smaller quantities, go organic. All total, it can save money. As a woman in her 70s, I’m less interested in prolonging my own life than in prolonging the lives of songbirds and doing my bit to lessen the number of industrial feedlots and the like. Is there a web site that helps us avoid buying the fruits, vegetables, grains and meats that contribute to all this destruction of the planet? I suppose buying local is the best answer (if it’s a greenmarket) but is there anything else definitive available? Thanks. Rotenone and pyrethrin are two common organic pesticides. There are lots more than that. Why do so many people think that organic means non-chemical? Do we truly know whether the naturally occuring organic chemicals used in organic farming – particularly at the corporate level – are really any better for the environment than those hybridized by guys in lab coats? I buy organic milk. It tastes better. What i grow myself is safe because i make sure it is safe, but it would not *always* meet organic standards. Could someone clarify: the list ranks those veggies that soak up the most pesticides. Does that mean it is of little use to wash those fruits and veggies at the top of the list? That most of the pesticides are systemic? Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
