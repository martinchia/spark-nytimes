 Minnesota is to die for — unless you are in a hurry to expire. Researchers have found that Minnesotans and residents of the other Upper Great Plains states have some of the lowest mortality rates in the country. The problem with conventional examinations of  variation in mortality rates, the researchers say, is that they tend to be limited to factors like socioeconomic and environmental conditions without taking geography into account. “These findings underscore the importance of further investigation of ‘people versus place’ in the study of mortality,” they write in the December issue of The American Journal of Public Health. The study was led by Jeralynn Sittig Cossman of Mississippi State University. In the long run, of course, the mortality rate for people across the country is the same (100 percent, for those keeping track). But for this study, the researchers looked at 35 years of data and calculated mortality rates over seven, five-year periods. Then they compared the results by county. The researchers were surprised  that the Upper Great Plains states fared so well. “Despite economic decline and rapid out-migration,” the study said, “it was the healthiest region.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F6 of the New York edition with the headline: In the Upper Great Plains, Lower Mortality Rates.
