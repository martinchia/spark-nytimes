If youâve been a longtime follower of Recipes for Health, you know how much I like combining beans and greens. They make a good, nourishing couple, and every peasant cuisine in the world seems to know this.  One of my favorite dishes from the Veracruz region of Mexico is a delicious black bean soup that brings together the beans and a local green thatâs related to lambâs quarters, for which I substituted spinach when I adapted it for Recipes for Health. I love to add greens to hearty minestrones and kale to slow-baked beans. One of my favorite dishes from the Southern Italian region of Apulia is bitter greens with dried favas, and I love a simple mussel or clam stew with beans and greens. Youâll find pomegranate molasses, lots of slowly browned onions and a garden of fresh herbs â mint, dill, cilantro â in several of this weekâs recipes.
