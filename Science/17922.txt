 To the Editor: Re “Embracing Silence in a Noisy World” (Books on Science, April 20): Katherine Bouton’s review of “In Pursuit of Silence” mentioned folks who would not be able to remain long in the Trappist New Melleray Abbey. I am one of those persons. I suffer from tinnitus — the result of spending most of a full minute with my head under the hood of a car with its horn blaring some 10 years ago. Whenever I find myself in a quiet place, the only sound I can hear is the resulting permanent, sibilant, ringing in my ears. For the first few years I nearly went crazy. Now I have learned to accept this background noise as a constant from which all other sounds vary. In actual silence, I hear only this steady hissing ring tone that will continue to accompany me on my daily rounds, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, until the day I die.
