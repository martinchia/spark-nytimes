 To the Editor: Re “Notebooks Shed Light on an Antibiotic’s Contested Discovery” (June 12): It is time for the hate campaign against Dr. Selman Waksman to stop. He was a brilliant scientist, beloved teacher, true philanthropist. Dr. Albert Schatz has been credited as co-discoverer of streptomycin. He used actinomycetes discovered by Dr. Waksman. The repeat experiment to validate Dr. Schatz’s was done by another student; the first test on chick embryos was done by yet another student; the first animal tests were done at the Mayo Clinic. Dr. Waksman made all the arrangements for large-scale production of the antibiotic. Dr. Waksman kept only 5 percent of the streptomycin royalties. (Dr. Schatz received a lump sum of $125,000 plus 3 percent.) The remaining 15 percent of Dr. Waksman’s original payment (for the work he did licensing and arranging production) went to the others in the lab, to Rutgers to create an Institute for Microbiology, and to create a Foundation for Microbiology. Enough is enough. Nan Waksman Schanbacher Merion Station, Pa. The writer is Dr. Selman Waksman’s granddaughter. Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
