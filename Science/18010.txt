 To the Editor: Re “Down the Hatch and Straight Into Medical History” (Jan. 11): Extracting swallowed foreign bodies from the stomach, as Dr. Chevalier Jackson did a century ago, is no historical quirk. Nowadays many cases are in adult patients with psychiatric illnesses who deliberately ingest such objects, including pens, batteries, knifes, razor blades and bedsprings. Fortunately, these foreign bodies can now be extracted relatively safely and painlessly using anesthesia and sedation.    Steven Moss, M.D. Providence, R.I. The writer is a professor of medicine at Brown University. To the Editor: Mary Cappello’s new book “Swallow,” about Chevalier Jackson’s collection of objects that people had swallowed, reminded me of a most unusual case. An elderly patient was brought to the hospital with progressive weight loss and trouble swallowing — thought to be related to throat numbness from a stroke, and aggravated by the loss of his partial denture several months earlier. The two causes coalesced when an X-ray showed that he had swallowed the denture. After endoscopically unhooking all its little barbs from the walls of his pharynx and removing it from his apparently numb throat, I asked him how it felt. He replied, “About the same”!
