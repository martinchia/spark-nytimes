 To the Editor: Re “A Tool to Quit Smoking Has Some Unlikely Critics” (Findings, Nov. 8): Congratulations to John Tierney for quitting smoking with nicotine gum, a proven and safe F.D.A.-approved nicotine replacement therapy. E-cigarettes, by contrast, are a new breed of unregulated nicotine replacement based on pulmonary inhalation of vaporized nicotine. It is not yet known what the impact of directly inhaling heated nicotine into the delicate tissue of smokers’ lungs will be, especially with long-term use of this product. Daniel F.
