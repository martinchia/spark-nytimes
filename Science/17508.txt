 A British study suggests that at least in some situations, bicycling with a helmet may be more dangerous than going without. Dr. Ian Walker, a professor of psychology at the University of Bath, was his own subject in a study that measured how closely cars drove to bicycles they passed on the road. Dr. Walker, using a bicycle fitted with a well-concealed video camera and ultrasonic sensor, measured his distance from cars as they passed by his bicycle. He rode with and without a helmet, and with and without a wig that made him look like a woman. He covered 200 miles at various times of day and made more than 2,500 observations. The study will appear in a future issue of Accident Analysis and Prevention. Dr. Walker found that cars consistently passed closer to him when he was wearing a helmet than when he was bareheaded, that trucks passed closer than cars, and that drivers passed closer to him without the wig than when they thought he was a woman.

The farther he rode from the curb, the closer drivers came to his bicycle. Dr. Walker was hit by a bus and a truck during the study, both times while wearing a helmet. He sustained a minor injury in the truck accident. But he warned that abandoning headgear was not the answer.
