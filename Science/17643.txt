 In the world of materials, stiffness and stretchiness are usually incompatible. A hard material will crack when you try to stretch it, while a stretchy material will be anything but stiff. But mussels seem to have figured out how to be stiff and stretchy. Their byssal threads — the fibers that attach them to rocks and other surfaces — have a protective coating, or cuticle, that can stretch up to 70 percent without cracking. That helps the mussels hold on in the rough and tumble of waves. Researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara, have been studying the structure of these coated fibers and have discovered that among other things, what enables the cuticles to stretch are deformable granules that stop tiny cracks from getting bigger. The latest research, reported by J. Herbert Waite, Niels Holten-Andersen and others in the journal Langmuir, looks at the chemistry of the cuticle. The researchers found that two metals, calcium and iron, were distributed throughout the cuticle, and that removing them reduced the hardness of the cuticle by 50 percent. The researchers also found that the metals were co-located with L-dopa, a key component of the cuticle proteins. The researchers say this suggests that the metals and L-dopa may form complexes that help keep the cuticle together under strain. The findings may eventually help in the development of biomimetic coatings for medical implants or industrial devices where there is a need for flexibility but hardness and durability, too.
