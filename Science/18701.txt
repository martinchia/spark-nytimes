Just in time for this weekend’s New York City Marathon, Runner’s World magazine offers an extra dose of inspiration with stories of runners who conquered disability or used running as a way to boost a charitable cause.  One of those runners is Kenyan marathoner Tegla Loroupe, who has twice won the race and will be running again Sunday. She was the first African woman to win a major marathon when she conquered New York in 1994. In 2004, she formed the Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation, which aims to resolve conflicts between warring communities in Africa through education, poverty programs and sports. Ms. Loroupe’s Peace Runs have attracted warriors from communities in Northern Kenya, North Eastern Uganda and Southern Sudan, who turn in weapons in order to run. She is now working to build the Tegla Loroupe Peace Academy, a place where warriors can trade in their guns and spears for top-notch athletic training. Ms. Loroupe has pledged her earnings from the marathon to her foundation. The magazine also highlights Amy Palmiero-Winters, who you should think about next time you feel tired on a run. Ms. Palmiero-Winters lost her left leg just below the knee in a motorcycle accident but now holds the world marathon record for female amputees, clocking a stunning 3:04. She also has plans to run a 100-mile ultra marathon. “If you could give me my leg back today,” she told the magazine, “I wouldn’t take it.” And finally, check out the Blue Planet Runners, a group of 20 runners who covered 15,200 miles in an around-the-world relay to raise awareness and money for safe drinking water. The stories of these and other running heroes appear in the magazine’s December issue, which is already on newsstands. Visit the Runner’s World Web site to read stories of running heroes from past years, including 73-year-old Mark Goldstein, who was once diagnosed with male breast cancer. After his diagnosis and treatment, Mr. Goldstein traveled all over the world to run every Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure â 114 in all. Some of them he ran twice. Comments are no longer being accepted. The runners featured here are making admirable contributions to others through their efforts. It is the other participants in the race, however, who need greater recognition of their achievements. There is far too much emphasis in Western health on cure rather than prevention. And when the talk does turn to prevention, it usually involves yet another supplement – whether Vitamin C, fish oils, or the putative benefits of chocolate or red wine. In other words, yet more pill popping. Exercise, when it gets a mention, is usually of the feeblest sort – typically, the claimed benefits of an half an hour steady walk, three times a week. As I have posted many times elsewhere over many years – Man was born to Run. Of all known life forms, we are the best endurance runners that have ever evolved. Unless we run, we are not and cannot be fully human. Of course, running a 42.2 km marathon is only a small part of running. For one thing, too many marathon runners only have one gear and plod along at the same pace if it’s a marathon or a 5K. To run properly, one has to be able to run as fast as possible and also as far as possible. Nevertheless, marathons are a decent start for any human keen to find again the runner within. Just remember now – when you can no longer run, life is no longer worth living. when you can no longer run, life is no longer worth living? Perhaps that’s just a tiny bit extreme… Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
