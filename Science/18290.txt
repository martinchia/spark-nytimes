 To the Editor: Re “Questioning the Allure of Putting Cells in the Bank” (Jan. 29): I am an eight-month survivor of a double-cord bone marrow stem cell transplant. I might not be alive if these cord cells were not available from banks in Australia and France. Clearly, I am grateful to the mothers who saved this cord blood, so you can only imagine what I think of the advice to not bank cord blood to save lives around the world. If the problem is the cost to the donor and scaremongering by the banks, then that is the issue that needs to be addressed. Noel BeninatiBallston Spa, N.Y.
