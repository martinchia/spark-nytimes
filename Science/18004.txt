 To the Editor: Re “One Runner’s Suffering Is Another’s Inspiration” (Personal Best, May 17): The question posted at the beginning of the article, “Do we run because we like the pain?” implies that pain is a universal, necessary experience for runners. It isn’t. I’ve been running (though not at the front of any pack) for about 20 years, and the only pain I’ve suffered has been from the occasional blister and a collision with a dog that left me with a minor shoulder injury. So let’s not discourage even the slow and klutzy from trying an exercise that is inexpensive, easy to start and self-paced. Lisa J. Bernt Belmont, Mass. ♦ To the Editor: I read with interest Gina Kolata’s column, hoping to find an answer as to why I ran six miles in Philadelphia’s 10-mile Broad Street Run despite intense pain that resulted in a stress fracture and no running for at least six weeks. Advertisement I had wanted to prove that I could do it again, and also I thought that if I pushed on I would be rewarded with just a touch of the euphoria that Ms. Kolata writes about. Part of me is proud of my accomplishment, but as I sit here in an air cast, I also feel kind of stupid. At least, it is good to see that I am not the only one.
