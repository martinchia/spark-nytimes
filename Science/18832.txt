Zucchini âPastaâ
	:
		If you donât eat wheat, or youâre on a low-carbohydrate diet and miss pasta, this can stand in for fettucine.	 
Asparagus With Green Garlic
	:
		When you sautÃ© or roast asparagus in hot olive oil, the asparagus will have a much more concentrated flavor than it would if steamed or blanched.	 
Mediterranean Okra and Tomato Stew
	:
		Best way to cook okra? Whole, after a quick marinade.	 
Seared Brussels Sprouts
	:
		For delicious brussels sprouts, cook them in very hot oil.	 
Rainbow Quinoa Tabbouleh
	:
