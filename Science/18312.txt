 Some people can’t perceive bitter tastes very well. Now a study from Spain shows that some Neanderthals were in the same boat. Bitter taste perception in humans has been studied most thoroughly with a bitter-tasting chemical, PTC, that is related to compounds in Brussels sprouts and similar foods. About one-quarter of people don’t taste  PTC. A gene, TAS2R38, encodes proteins that are part of taste receptors on the tongue. There are several variants of the gene, a dominant “taster” type and a recessive “nontaster” type, which occur with about the same frequency. Only if a person inherits  a recessive type from both parents would she  be unable to taste PTC. Carles Lalueza-Fox of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (CSIC-UPF) in Barcelona and colleagues looked at the TAS2R38 gene in a sample from a 48,000-year-old Neanderthal bone  collected at a site in northern Spain. They found similar variations in the gene, and determined that the individual had one dominant form and one recessive form. That means the Neanderthal could perceive bitter taste. The scientists say the findings, which were reported in Biology Letters, show that variation in bitterness perception started to appear  before human and Neanderthal lineages began to diverge a half-million years ago or more.
