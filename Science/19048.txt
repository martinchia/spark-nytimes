Solve a medical mystery with Dr. Lisa Sanders. The Challenge: A 19-year-old man collapses at work after months of increasing weakness. Can you figure out why? Every month, the Diagnosis column of The New York Times Magazine asks Well readers to sift through a difficult medical case and solve a diagnostic riddle. In this case, a young man goes to the emergency room time after time for weakness and other vague symptoms. Each time, he is diagnosed with dehydration, given some fluids and sent home. Finally, an E.R. doctor in their  small-town Oklahoma hospital puts it all together. I’ve given you the information that was available when the patient made his final visit to the emergency room. Iâll also give you the patient history and physical examination and test results obtained by the emergency room physician. Itâs up to you to use this information to make the correct diagnosis. As usual, the first person to crack the case gets a copy of my book, “Every Patient Tells a Story,” and, of course, that fabulous feeling you get when you figure out a tough problem. The Patient’s Story 
“I can’t…do this…anymore,” the young man stammered. Hearing his 19-year-old son’s voice behind him, making yet another excuse, sent a bolt of irritation through the father. He had been working with his son for the past several weeks, ever since he had more or less been fired from a friend’s business. The friend told him that his son never seemed to feel like working. And it was true. He grew tired after the tiniest amount of effort. If he could, the boy would spend all day in bed.  He turned to snap at his son, but his irritation died on the spot, replaced instantly by fear. His son was slumped over, his head on the work table. He lifted his head â the very act looked like a struggle. His face was pale, his lips tinged with blue. His eyes were dark and weirdly empty looking. “My hands,” he whispered, “they are so cold.” His fingers carried the same blue as his lips. The father hurried over to the boy and helped him out to the car. At home, his wife, too, was worried. “Take me to the E.R.,” he breathed. “I’m scared. There’s something bad wrong.” “If  they can’t figure out what’s wrong this time,” the man told his wife, “we’re taking him to Tulsa.” Back to the Hospital  
The emergency room at Tahlequah City Hospital was quiet when mother and son arrived. If the son was as depressed as his mother by the familiar sounds and smells of the tiny E.R., he didn’t show it. The family had been there several times over the past year.  The boy had been healthy his entire life â active and strong. He was always out hunting with his pals and his dog. Then, maybe 18 months ago, all that changed. He stopped hunting. He gave away his dog. He stopped seeing his friends. Eventually, he stopped going to school.  When his parents asked him what was wrong, he would just tell them that he felt too weak to do anything. His parents worried about him. Was he depressed? Was he on drugs? Neither seemed likely. He was a good son. But recently, he had been so withdrawn. He was their only child, and they weren’t sure what to make of it all.  The Patient’s History That summer, he seemed to get a stomach bug that just didn’t go away. It started one afternoon when he was supposed to go out with a friend. His mother heard him retching in the bathroom. She worried that he was making himself vomit so he wouldn’t have to go.  But the same thing happened the next day, and then the next. She took him to the E.R., where she was told he had a virus and was dehydrated. They gave him some fluids. She told the doctors at the E.R. how tired and weak he had been all summer. And they seemed to come up with an answer. His thyroid hormones were low. He was started on thyroid hormone, Synthroid, and it seemed to help.  But then he had another stomach bug, and then another. He went to the E.R. again. This time, it was pneumonia and dehydration. That was the first time they told her that his sodium level was low. That’s impossible, she told them. He eats a ton of salt, on everything. He was given fluids and antibiotics and sent home. His low sodium probably occurred because he was dehydrated, the doctor said. When you sweat, you lose sodium as well as water.  You can see the notes from that doctor’s visit here.

 A week or two later, she sent the boy to the carwash with their four-wheel drive vehicle. He was gone for maybe an hour when she got a phone call. Her son had fallen off the vehicle and hit the back of his head. It was bleeding, and he seemed a little out of it. He told her he had grown too weak to hold on. She took him back to the E.R., where he received a couple of stitches and a tetanus shot.  Why did he grow so weak that he fell? his mother asked. He was probably just dehydrated, she was told. He should just try to drink more water in this heat. You can see the note from that hospital visit here.

 A New Normal 
Eventually, they settled into a pattern. The young man got a job with a family friend in the heating and air-conditioning business. He’d go to work every day. He’d come home, sometimes in the early afternoon, and head straight to his room. He slept a lot. A couple times a month, he would be sick to his stomach. His mother would hear him vomiting, but he never complained. He’d be sick for a day or two, and then go back to work.  Then one day, the young man’s boss came to see his parents. They were old friends, so they could see he was troubled. Something’s not right with your boy, he told the worried parents. He comes to work and says he wants to work, but then tells me he’s too tired to work after doing almost nothing. “I’m 65 years old, and I’m running circles around him,” he said. Send him back to me when you figure out what’s wrong with him, he suggested apologetically.  They took him back to his primary care doctor; she was baffled. She couldn’t find anything wrong with the boy. That’s when the young man started working for his father. Now the young man and his mother were back in the E.R. This time, he seemed sicker than ever. A New Doctor 
When Dr. Mary K. Moore met her new patient, she had to check the age on the triage sheet a second time. He was 19 but looked 12. He was quite small â just over 5 feet â and couldn’t have weighed much more than 90 pounds. He had no body fat but little muscle. She figured he must have gone through puberty but if so, it hadn’t left any hair on his face or body. He had been vomiting for the past several days, the mother told the young doctor. No fever, no diarrhea. Then this morning, he had just collapsed. He has been sick for months, she told the doctor. We keep coming back here, but no one can tell us what’s going on. Why is my son so sick?  The doctor nodded and asked a few more questions. He didn’t drink alcohol and he didn’t smoke. He took only Synthroid. She quickly examined the young man. His blood pressure was low, though perhaps normal for one as slight as he. His fingers and toes were cool but otherwise normal, with good color and pulses.  She told the mother that she wasn’t sure why he kept becoming sick, but that she was going to review his past visits and see if she could figure it out.  You can view the laboratory results from his current visit here.

 After nearly an hour the doctor returned. “I have a couple of ideas,” she told the mother, “but I need to do a little reading.”
