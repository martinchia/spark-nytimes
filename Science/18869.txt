I was planning to devote this weekâs Recipes for Health to walnuts, as the California walnut harvest took place just a few weeks ago and the walnuts I am buying in my farmersâ market couldnât be fresher (well, they could be a little fresher â slightly moist, the way fresh, undried walnuts are sold in French produce markets. But the California growers dry their nuts before sending them to market, as the spoilage risk for moist fresh walnuts is high.) I began working on recipes, and once I had written out and begun testing I realized that each dish was a winter greens recipe that included walnuts. The two foods go wonderfully together. Greens and brassicas are the vegetables that I rely on from November through February in California, and on into April in colder climates. The walnuts and greens combo packs an impressive nutritional punch, whether you are adding the omega 3-rich walnuts to a salad made with equally omega 3-rich mÃ¢che and antioxidant-rich radicchio, or a kale and cabbage coleslaw; or grinding them with basil in a pesto to toss with broccoli and pasta, or combining the walnuts with other seeds and spices in a dukkah, to sprinkle over cooked spinach. I also combined walnuts with kale, rice and black quinoa in a delicious, wonderfully textured mixed grains risotto.  Here are five new ways to add walnuts to your meal.
