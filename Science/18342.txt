 To the Editor: Re “8-Year-Olds on Statins? A New Plan Quickly Bites Back” (Well, July 8): As both a parent and grandparent, I am appalled by the suggestion of using statins in children. Will this become just another in our pantheon of pharmaceuticals that has become de rigeur for the grade school set? We can now find a syndrome and a palliative for each situation. When will we all face the fact that in most cases, except the very extreme, caring for a child’s physical, mental and emotional health is the purview  of the parent, not the pill? Judith R.
