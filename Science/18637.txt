Tina Fineberg for The New York Times Roosevelt Island, tucked between Manhattan and Queens, is easily explorable on foot.
The Roving RunnerBrian Fidelman explores New York and more on foot.
Roosevelt Island is sitting right there. A thin, two-mile-long slice of residential life sandwiched between Manhattan and Queens, I had seen it and heard about it, but somehow after 13 years of living in the city, I’d never been there. 
What better way to see a tiny island than by running around it?
I grabbed my Metrocard, keys and $10, and rode the 4 train from Union Square two stops up to 59th Street. From there I took a short walk to Second Avenue, swiped my Metrocard and boarded the Roosevelt Island Tram.
While this was just a daily commute for most people on board, it was quite a treat for a first-timer. This is the type of cable car you see on a steep mountain, not in the middle of New York City. The tram glided eastward and upward, climbing 250 feet in the air and softly descending onto the island. Throughout the four-and-a-half minute trip, I craned my neck to soak in the views behind us in Manhattan, ahead into Queens, and along the East River, just feet from the Queensboro Bridge. (The F train also stops on Roosevelt Island, but now is the time to take the tram because it is scheduled to shut for six months for renovation.)
Before I started my run, I stopped in the visitors center, located in an old trolley kiosk. The woman inside, who works for the Roosevelt Island Historical Society, gave me a little background on this quirky island, which is home to about 12,000 people of varying incomes and ethnicities.
In the past, she told me, Roosevelt Island was the site of several institutions for the sick, mentally ill and criminally convicted. It became residential in the 1970s. She also assured me that the island is a great place to run, because a path follows along most of the island’s perimeter, making for an easy four mile route. (Next month, Roosevelt Island will be the site for the “Run for Congo Women 5K.”) 
After thanking her for the history lesson, I turned south and began running along the river promenade, passing under the Queensboro Bridge, which crosses over but doesn’t stop on Roosevelt Island. To my left was a tennis bubble, and to my right, the skyscrapers of Manhattan.
Brian Fidelman Roosevelt Island’s Smallpox Hospital, sometimes called the Renwick Ruin.
I passed Coler Goldwater Hospital and approached a fenced-off area near the southern end of the island. The sign said “No Trespassing,” but the woman at the kiosk had told me to go right through the open gate. I came upon the ruins of the Smallpox Hospital, which opened in 1856, became a training school for nurses in the 1880s and was abandoned in the 1950s. The landmark structure, designed by James Renwick Jr. (who also designed St. Patrick’s Cathedral), is being stabilized after its north facade recently collapsed. The ruins had a bombed-out, eerie beauty.
When I reached the island’s southern tip, I stood for a moment among the weeds. Nobody else was around, and it felt like a lonely outpost, even though the United Nations was only a few hundred yards away across the East River. Off to the left was the famous Pepsi-Cola sign in Hunters Point, Queens.
Work finally has begun on making this southern point the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park. How long has that plan been around? Its designer, the renowned architect Louis Kahn, died in 1974. 
Brian Fidelman Blackwell House is among New York City’s oldest surviving homes.
I exited the construction zone and returned to the island path, which took me to the Queens-facing side of the island. I ran up the eastern promenade for several minutes before spotting Blackwell House, a post-Revolutionary farmhouse that is one of the city’s oldest surviving houses. The area was bustling with children playing and residents walking around.
The New York Times 
The atmosphere here seemed a world away from Manhattan. The island feels like a secluded residential enclave, yet with enough of an urban vibe to make it uniquely different from a suburb.
Across the river in Queens, the landscape was dominated by a mammoth industrial plant that I told myself I would try to identify when I got home. The answer: it’s the Ravenswood electrical station, and it generates about a quarter of New York City’s electrical needs. What I couldn’t see were several underwater turbines, belonging to a company called Verdant Power. The turbines have been providing renewable power to Roosevelt Island’s large parking garage and the adjoining Gristedes supermarket as part of a demonstration project the company hopes to expand. 
I continued running north, passing the Roosevelt Island Bridge (on which cars come and go from Queens), as well as tennis courts and playing fields. I stopped here briefly at a water fountain. 
Off to the left was the Octagon Tower, which in the 1800s was part of the New York Lunatic Asylum and is now the lobby for an apartment building. It was here that the journalist Nellie Bly gained entry by faking insanity. Her expose of the poor conditions led to major changes and made her famous.
I reached the park at the northern end of the island, looped around a pretty 19th-century lighthouse, and headed back south, with apartment buildings and swimming pools to my left and the river to my right. I passed a few other joggers and some people in motorized wheelchairs. I gazed across the water to Manhattan’s Upper East Side, where I could see people jogging and biking on the path above the FDR Drive.
I had run a leisurely pace until now, but as I completed my lap around the island I saw an oil tanker just to my right floating along slightly faster than I was running. I sped up to stay even with the tanker and kept pace for about a minute, smiling my way through this “race.” The vessel gradually pulled away and I slowed back down, enjoying some more views of Manhattan and grateful that I had made this trip. 
Here’s the route I took, tracked by G-map Pedometer.

Love the series, Fiddy – but now you’ve told the world about my favorite “unknown” loop… P-R Aside from the running aspect, this is a great geography and history lesson.  Having lived in NY all my life, I’m reading and learning about places whose names I knew but that was it. Thank you! Anonymous Great story about running on Roosevelt Island. It is really a hidden gem with great waterfront views. In addition to access by the tram or F Subway train, you can get to Roosevelt Island by running over the Queensboro Bridge through LIC and crossing the Roosevelt Island (36th Avenue) Bridge. More information on Roosevelt Island running is available below. //rooseveltislander.blogspot.com/search/label/Jogging hi Brian, I keep a blog called The Roving Locavore, and I’m a runner.  Want to swap guest posts?
//www.therovinglocavore.com I love this story !!! Excellent series. You should turn this into a book. It will be fascinating. When I read your article, I follow along by opening google maps,  magnifying and demagnifying when necessary.
Although I have been to NYC many times and I am quite familiar with the four boroughs, I am not a native new yorker like you are.
Anyone fascinated with urban history should follow your footsteps, maybe not literally!
I can feel your love and pride you have for your city, your home.
Thank You, Thank You, Thank You! Too bad you missed the four bronze in-river sculptures on your return trip. They are in the river just north of the swimming pool on the Manhattan side of the island.  As far as I know they are the only four sculptures permanently located in any of the rivers around Manhattan. I would like to know other than the tram to get to Manhatton, no bridge like the one to Queens? Thanks for a concise scenic overview.  I come to NYC every year at least once and I will have to check this out on my next visit! You missed the old sculpture, “marriage of real estate and money”, in the river (west side ~upper 70s?); it still reflects the times! Having lived there for several years in the 90s, the island feels overcrowded when I visit it now; I wonder what older residents think about all the real estate development this past decade… FROM TPP — Here’s a photo of the sculpture. running on Roosevelt island? as in, running for your life! Its one of the best running tracks in NYC as far as Iâm concerned. Limited cars, friendly people and water fountains. It even has a public toilet that is always kept spotless (thank you whatever agency cleans it)
Kevin Leddy. No. 8: We might count the Merchant Marine memorial off Battery Park as a sculpture in a river: //travel.webshots.com/photo/2106724330031860892XmmTae Brian –
I enjoyed your article about Roosevelt Island very much. Not being a native New Yorker, there is SO much to take in about the city and its boroughs, that when an article such as yours comes along, I feel like I’ve had a cultural lesson on NYC! By the way, I’m glad you were able to take along photography equipment with your $10 and metro card, because I also enjoye the pictures in the article. Thank you! Bob – you don’t know what you are talking about with that ‘run for your life” crack.  Roosevelt Island is one of the safest parts of the city.  I lived there for ten years and many times I’ve walked the river walk at night with not a thought of risk.  A major part of the population are UN diplomats, professionals, and families of the Medical Staff of NYU Med School.  Hardly a rough bunch. Thank you for this story. I lived on Roosevelt Island in the fall of 1985 with my parents just after graduating college, and would run the promenades aroung the island when I needed some space. I always found the dichotomy of the peaceful Island Setting surrounded by the bustling City and it’s skyline a comforting distraction as back then, I did not run with an Ipod! Roosevelt Island is truly a uniquely fascinating element in the NYC periodic table. i liked the lively presentation of this city by your eyes and would like to roam Roosevelt island. my impulse is to know about the historical past of it……….. Come and visit us on Roosevelt Island. You can come by car or bike over the RI Bridge from Vernon Blvd and 36th Avenue in LIC.  The F Train stops here and the subway station is 3blocks north of the Tram Station.   Plenty of time to visit, since our tram overhaul will not start until March, 2010. Come stop by the RIHS Visitor Center Kiosk, open Thursday to Sunday 12 noon to 5 p.m. We have maps and suggestions for a great visit. The Lady in the Kiosk
Judyb I lived on roosevelt island for 2 years (just moved onto the main island 3 months ago)  and also have made this same run many many times. It’s beautiful in the spring time on the south west part of the island because the row of cherry blossom trees are blooming and makes for a terrifically scenic run. ChicagoanMaroon – there are five boroughs. Great story. I should check it out! Growing up I was always terrified of the tram and never took it :) The tram is perfectly safe. I’ve taken it for 30 years without incident.  I can’t believe that there is finally an article in the New York Times that favorably reviews Roosevelt Island. Its about time! That place is such a wonderfully civilized and serene place to live. If only Rivercross would allow dogs….. About 10 years ago I did the Roosevelt Island 10K, which was a fabulous race. Now I’m disappointed to learn that is doesn’t happen anymore. Does anyone remember the towels?  What happened to the race.
BTW, I love the Roving Runner posts!!! I grew up in the island in the late 70s and early 80s. Back then it was NY’s one true village. No dogs, electric buses and special passes to get your car on the island for just a few short minutes.
My mother still lives there although I have now returned to Australia.
If you think it is an escape now, back then it was a veritable paradise.
The developers finally ruined a lot of the promise the island held with real estate and the dollar truimphing over asthetics and community.
But as an old islander and one of a lucky bunch of kids who knew it in its formative years, it will always hold a special place in my heart.
Nice blog. Lovely article.  Roosevelt Island, is a amazing place. It is located on East River, and has wonderful views of Manhattan East Side, go to the south of the Island to watch United Nations and Lower East Manhattan.  If you visit this place then guys please dont forget to visit Katagiri( 52 st) for a snack of sushi sashimi or rolls with japanese beer. Thanks to blog owner from Timeshare Pages team for this lovely article. Great story about running on Roosevelt Island. It is really a hidden gem with great waterfront views. In addition to access by the tram or F Subway train, you can get to Roosevelt Island by running over the Queensboro Bridge through LIC and crossing the Roosevelt Island (36th Avenue) Bridge.
