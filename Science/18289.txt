 To the Editor: Re “When a Murderer Wants to Practice Medicine” (Jan. 29): Dr. Lawrence K. Altman refers to Karl Helge Hampus Svensson repeatedly as “killer” or “murderer.” I have worked in prison-to-work rehabilitation and I know that the insidious practice of referring to people — no matter how long ago their crimes occurred — as “killers” or “illegal aliens” steps beyond semantics and reduces these human beings to the law they have broken. These terms prejudice the discussion from the start and contribute little to the debate on how a civilized society should respond when people overstep its stated bounds.
