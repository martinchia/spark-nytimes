 To the Editor: Re: “In Crises at Sea, Chivalry Dies First” (Aug. 7): Used for years to train budding epidemiologists, a data set on mortality rates that is presented for teaching purposes as “unknown,” but that is actually from the Titanic disaster, introduces a telling wrinkle on the sinking. Using the price of the purchased ticket as a proxy for socioeconomic class, the largest spread of all the mortality comparisons is between the rate among upper- and middle-class children under age 15 (3 percent) and their lower-class comparison group (70 percent). There is a similar but not so extreme difference in mortality rates between women of the two class groups, 10 percent versus 53 percent. Chivalry observed? Yes, but more for the wealthy. Nicholas H.
