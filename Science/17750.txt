 A new study suggests that the Athabasca Valles, a group of valleys near the Martian equator, were not formed by ice, as some scientists have theorized. Instead, high-resolution images of the valleys reveal more than 250 coiling spiral patterns that closely resemble lava flows on the Big Island of Hawaii. And that means the valleys on Mars were probably formed by volcanic activity, said Andrew J. Ryan, the planetary scientist at Arizona State University who discovered the coils. Mr. Ryan, a first-year doctoral student, reported the findings in the journal Science, along with his colleague Philip R. Christensen, also a planetary scientist at Arizona State. The Hawaiian coils were produced by a shearing effect, in which lava flows at different speeds and in different directions. It is likely that something similar happened on Mars, Mr. Ryan said. The coils may also have been formed through a spreading process like the one that produces oceanic crust. In that process, magma solidifies into a crust that slowly spreads outward, like two conveyor belts moving in opposite directions, Mr. Ryan said. A coil can form in the spreading center. Mr. Ryan said he suspected both volcanic processes had been at work on Mars, though he added, “In some areas shearing alone might have caused coil formation.” A version of this article appears in print on May 1, 2012, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: Signs of Volcanoes In Mars Topography.
