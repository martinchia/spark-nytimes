By most standards, John Elder Robison has led an interesting life. He created smoking guitars and other special effects for the rock band Kiss, worked on video games for a toy company and was featured in a best-selling memoir written by his brother, the author Augusten Burroughs. But what is surprising about Mr. Robison is that he unknowingly lived most of his life on the autism spectrum. It wasn’t until his 40’s that a psychologist friend suggested he might have Asperger’s syndrome, a disorder often considered a high-functioning form of autism. People with Asperger’s usually have average or above-average intelligence, but they lack the intuitive ability to read social cues and find it difficult to make friends and form relationships. Characteristics of Asperger’s include difficulty maintaining eye contact and a single-mindedness that can be odd and frustrating but also act to fuel creative genius. After his brother featured him in the memoir “Running with Scissors,” Mr. Robison became a source of fascination among his brother’s fans. At book readings, adults with Asperger’s and parents of children with the diagnosis would approach Mr. Burroughs with questions about his brother. “Aren’t there any proper books for these people?” Mr. Burroughs wondered.  Now there is. With his brother’s encouragement, Mr. Robison has penned his own best-selling memoir about life with Asperger’s. The title, “Look Me in the Eye,” refers to the countless times teachers, parents and other adults demanded eye contact from him as a young child. But “Look Me in the Eye” isn’t a tragic tale. It’s an entertaining, provocative and highly-readable story by a great storyteller who happens to have Asperger’s. What is most remarkable about Mr. Robison’s story is that it is surprisingly easy to relate to, even if you’ve never knowingly encountered anyone with an autism disorder. Most of us haven’t toured with rock bands or created video games, but nearly everyone can relate to feeling like an outsider. Who hasn’t had a socially awkward moment or felt like they didn’t fit in? “You may not have Asperger’s, but I will almost guarantee that you will see yourself in Asperger’s,” said Mr. Robison in an interview. “When they say it’s a spectrum, you have at one end people who are totally disabled by autism, and the middle people like me who are eccentric but get by fine in life. And from here on it blends seamlessly into normality. That’s why so many millions of people identify with my story.” Reading Mr. Robison’s book will leave you with a slightly altered world view. He makes you question the logic of human emotions, telling the story of how he smiled after hearing news that someone had died. Bystanders were horrified by his insensitivity, but in his head his reaction made perfect sense. He was merely happy and relieved to know that everyone in his own family was safe. For parents of children with Asperger’s, Mr. Robison’s story will give them hope. Despite living most of his life without a diagnosis, Mr. Robison experienced many of the milestones that define a so-called “normal” life. He got married, had a child, got divorced and remarried a second time. He enjoyed professional success long before his book was a best seller. In addition to the rock band special effects and work as a toy company engineer and manager, he now runs his own business restoring luxury cars. By the time Mr. Robison’s story is finished, you will rethink your own definition of normal, and it may spark a new appreciation of the untapped potential behind every quirky, awkward person who doesn’t quite fit in. Comments are no longer being accepted. as a mother of a young daughter with many socially awkward mannerisms and talents, i have found myself reading on the issue of the autism “spectrum” time and again. what i find difficult to reconcile is why there is a label for qualities that are so common in folks that aren’t “autistic,” or in other words, find me a person who doesn’t have one of these traits. what a world this would be if we could just accept everyone, quirks and all. When it comes to assessing a person’s health it is either one is or is not well.  Such cut-n-dry approach comes so naturally to most of us.  I am really amazed by Robinson’s profound perspective of symptoms ‘blending seemlessly into normality.’ Are we then justified in labelling persons like ‘autistic,’ ‘schizophrenic,’ etc. and then isolate and humiliate them? The book would be a great eye-opener and a must-read one. Thank you, John!= Gurudatt This is an interesting article, and should give hope to many parents of children identified as autistic.  At the same time, it points to the difficulty of defining normalcy.  With so much variability in traits among individuals both with regard to autistic spectrum and other health aspects, identifying characteristics that need to be treated and those that need to be accepted is a tough task.   In particular, the example cited of âlook me in the eyeâ reminds me of articles about people from different cultures coming to the US and having difficulties looking someone in the eye, especially at someone in authority. They in fact have been trained not to look people in the eye, because in their culture it is considered to be confrontational to look someone in the eye.  Should they be treated for their condition?

Your Guide to News Around the Web This is definitely going on my reading list. My adult son shows all the signs of Asperger’s, although having been raised, as he is fond of pointing out “in a house full of women,” his social skills aren’t as lacking as others. I have known since he was a baby that something was “off,” but have never been able to convince a clinician of anything. He was a good, well-behaved student in school. He lagged in language skills and excelled in math. His attention span was short. If you ever tried to talk to him about difficult matters, he would quite literally shut down. Typical punishments never worked.  And now, we lack the money and insurance to get a definitive diagnosis, which we feel would help him as he attempts, at age 25, to start college, despite being an A/B student in high school.  We don’t feel he needs a label, but it would help him and perhaps his instructors and counselors understand and guide him better. A diagnosis or label doesn’t need to be limiting. Forcing people into “normality” because you don’t know any better, however, can be limiting, if not worse. I enjoyed this book as a work of literature.  John Elder Robinson reads like the most reliable narrator out there. Back when I was studying fiction writing at the Iowa Writer’s Workshop, the director, Frank Conroy, used to demand our work convey, “Meaning…(bang of fist on desk) sense…(another bang)… and clarity (third bang).” Frank, this book came out too late for you, but the rest of us can welcome it as a textbook case of brilliant writing. The most salient problems that Ausberger’s people have is not the disorder.  They are most frequently far more intelligent than others; and, have atypical talents. But, their social skills are wanting relative to cultural norms. The most important problem is how their peers deal with these unusual social behaviors. I have taught at a university for 25 years — that’s thousands of students… Clearly the most intelligent students was a man who had Ausberger’s. As an analogy concerning his lack of social skills:
one day, I treated him to a Chinese lunch. He ate the rice with his fingers. Very smart and quite talented: what is one to do? He (now having been graduated), he remains my friend. There are many illnesses that are considered spectrum illnesses including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, etc..  Once you start reading about these illnesses you wonder who is really “normal”. We all could use more compassion in dealing with ALL illnesses and people’s quirks instead of getting caught up in labels.
There are some illnessess that do not affect the mind and whose victims are well organized and educated have created a tremendous awareness for themselves.
Why should we just have compassion for them?
Thank you Robinson family for sharing your “normalcy” with us! How can I recommend a friend who happen to be the grandma of my grandson, to read this interesting article about the condition that our commun grandson is suffers of, as I can see. Please reply. Thanks
 From TPP — I’m not sure what you are asking me. But if you feel like your grandson has an autistic spectrum disorder one solution might be to read the book. Mr. Robison talks at length about his life as a child with Asperger’s (although undiagnosed). If there are examples in the book that remind you of your grandson, that might be a way to start the conversation. Another article by Pullitzer prize winning writer Tim Page about his life with Asperger’s appeared recently in the New Yorker. To read that article, click here I also recommend a new website, which includes video information showing you behaviors that may signal autism spectrum disorders. To read my blog post about the site and link to it, click here. As a female with this undiagnosed disorder, I have to tell you that my life is a living hell, and that I wish I could just die everyday.  I have no friends except for my husband, who is quite patient with my never ending questions about humanity and what is normal and what is not. I’m 45 and am NOW just getting used to the fact that I should just accept myself.  But I  cannot accept my narrow choices for a career, everything hinges on social intelligence!! My brother and I both loved “Running With Scissors” and this book as well.  We grew up in a politely dysfunctional family and learned to cope with our parents’ oddities (and our own now diagnosed mental illnesses) by making light of them or by developing coping strategies that are a bit odd, but involve others in the ‘joke.’  As a college lecturer, for instance, I sometimes deputize a student in my class as the “referee.” If the student thinks I’m drifting from the topic, she or he holds up a “yellow card.”  If I’m _really_ digressing, the student holds up a “red card.”  At the same time, my brother and I return to our family home full of guns each Christmas…not the best environment for two folks with a history of suicidal depression.  But that’s funny, right?  Our household full of weapons, our non-communicative relatives, and our strange reenactment of “American Gothic” on an almost daily basis.  I’d like to think that even though our writing talents do not approach those of Mr Burroughs and Mr Robinson, my brother and I do our own bit of therapeutic narration. For Kathy (No. 9) I wonder if she has considered a career, or even perhaps just some coursework, in anthropology?  I went into the discipline because it was the first place where I felt like I could legitimately ask these questions about what was “normal” in a social situation.  It helped me intellectualize my own (often awkward) social interactions, and I was able to visit a place where my way of coping with the world was actually _the normal_ way of coping, rather than being strange or offensive.  This was tremendously reassuring–I might not be so good at being American, but I certainly am good at being a member of my village abroad! After having one child with OCD and one with ADD, and having been slightly ADD myself, I have to say that I now see many “mental illnesses” or syndromes as simply exaggerated or unbalanced brain capacities of one kind or another. A person with OCD is preternatually scrupulous. A person with Aspergers is oriented toward patterns rather than social interaction. A person with ADD cannot focus on things that are meaningless to him. The brain that works in our world is the one that does everything pretty well. But the person who excells in our world is often unbalanced in his or her talents. I seeing being “not normal” as more than anything a gamble with somewhat longer odds–the chances for success are less, but the payoff can be much bigger. I grew up with a brother whose behaviors no one could explain. Unbelievably intelligent, but no clue as to how to talk to people, look at people, that picking his nose in public was not appropriate, no matter how many times we reminded him. Embarrassing. When the term ‘aspergers’ came to light a number of years ago, and was described, I knew I had the diagnosis. Ever since, I have been able to accept my brother for his unique sense of humor (repeated many times), his take on situations and people, and I now can rest because I know he will never change. There is no longer the assumption that he will ‘get better’. I love him for who he is, can take him only in small doses, and no longer feel guilty about it.
-Posted by no longer angry I read John Elder Robison’s book last weekend and thought it was truly enlightening.  The reason I chose to read it is that during a recent family trauma, it came as an epithany that my “odd” cousin had, in fact, Asperger’s Syndrome.  There we were, transfering his parents to an assisted living facility, which left all of us physicially and emotionally exhausted, and before we had a moment to sit down and catch our breaths, there he was, strapped to his camera, asking us all to “Smile.”  In that split second, I said to myself, “This is not a Kodak moment – oh my goodness, he’s got Asperger’s.”  He was absolutely clueless to the emotions in the room.  The only thing that could have been any more bizarre, would have been for him to take pictures at a funeral! In the subsequent weeks, my family and I have been reading up on Asperger’s. We are going to find the right moment to tell this 57 year old man that he has Asperger’s.  Hopefully, like John Elder Robinson, he will hopefully appreciate the diagnosis and begin a new life with less heartache.  Already, some of our family members, with this new knowledge are beginning to understand his behaviors better.  Does it make it easier to deal with him, no, but hopefully, once he understands, perhaps we can all work together at making our time spent with him better. One of my friends still takes flowers from gravesites  and can’t understand why this is outrageous. Perhaps her quirk (this is one of many) is related to a disorder and is not just a social blunder. TPP responds: Fascinating quirk, though. Once I learned about Asperger’s gotten to know a number of people “on the spectrum”. I have come to value the utter honesty and lack of guile that is as fundamental to “not having a clue about social interaction” as failing to make eye contact or getting up and leaving a room abruptly without a word to anyone. Unlike most neuro-typicals, people with Asperger’s usually don’t lie; they simply don’t know how to lie or why one would not tell the truth. The result is, you can be straight with them, because they will always be straight with you. In addition, most high functioning autistics I have met have a lot to tell you about things other people don’t bother to be concerned about and they often have a keen sense of humor as well. Having a son who has been through a variety of evaluations for ADD, NLD and Asbergers from some of the most renowned experts in the country, I have come to the rather jaded conclusion that much of the dramatic increase in autistic spectrum diagnosis is due to the market opportunity many in the industry see for professional growth and profit. I notice that the waiting rooms for many of these threrapeutic services are filled with older parents who have means and who have probably read more books on child development than Spock himself.  As other contributors have pointed out, there are very few among us who do not have a weak spot or a challenge of some sort when it comes to communication, attention or calculation skills. I am not saying that these evaluations and services are not necessary, but I have heard very few stories of private practice evaluators and psychologists who tell parents the difficulties their kids are having fall within the “normal” spectrum and should be addressed as they have been through the ages – with creative parenting strategies and grit.  There seems to be too much emphasis these days on having the perfect child and hiring other people to address our own challenges. Is the diagnosis important to the person or those around them.  I am not sure the person can change so easily and may be more unhappy knowing there is a definite flaw in their personality.  On the other hand for those around them, once they are aware of this possible diagnosis and realize their manners are not mean spirited or intentional, they can try to help them improve their social awareness and build their social skills. Regarding Ken’s comments, whether the diagnosis is important to the person or those around them … all I can say from what I’ve been reading and from the Asperger’s experts that I’ve consulted, most Aspies who get the diagnosis as adults, have known all their lives that they were different and having the diagnosis helps put that piece of the puzzle of their lives into perspective.  Likewise, for people like myself, who have been puzzled by my cousin’s “odd” behavior, my family and I can now step back and not get emotional about his behavior.  For us now, with the understanding that our relative is an “Aspie,” it is a winning situation for us.  Hopefully, when we tell him, he will eventually find comfort in knowing how special he is. I relate to Kathy, I’m also a 45 year old woman who was an undiagnosed Aspie (until recently). I also get frustrated with the emphasis in our society on social intelligence, but I think I’ve developed a lot of coping mechanisms (like mimicry) that have helped me.  I’ve read Aspergers in women often carries with it the ability to mimic normal behavior.  I remember so many times in my childhood copying obsessively the posture and speaking rhythms of the normal kids, only to be frustrated eventually because I couldn’t get the content of social interaction right.  As I grew up I developed more of a repertoire.   I recently read Temple Grandin’s book “Animals in Translation” and she (who is autistic, but not Aspie) described increasing her repertoire of social interactions by doing what I did, essentially copying and memorizing them.   That said, I’m still frustrated, and do often feel that the things I want to accomplish in the world require more social fluidity than I have.  But I’m glad that people are finally hearing more about us.  Now Aspies are the “flavor of the month”…! I totally disagree with #16.  I have sat in countless of the same waiting rooms with my autistic son and have observed hundreds of other kids in those rooms.  Autistic kids are, generally, very obviously different from normal kids. Once one knows what to look for, the vast majority of ASD kids can be identified pretty easily–literally within 30 seconds to a minute of meeting a kid.  The notion that ASD is being disgnosed too frequently is a pernicious myth.  Something is causing the enormous increase in ASD disorders and we’ve got to figure out what it is.  When we attribute the increase in ASD to misdiagnosis or changing diagnostic criteria, we ignore the real problem. i would just like to thank all of the many people who are working hard and fighting to find the cure for autism. my brother was diagnosed at the age of 2. all i can say is there has been a major differnece in the last 10 years. thank you to all! I am a parent of an Asperger boy, age 6, and I have to address this idea that we all have our quirks and that people who Think their kid has asperger’s are really just wanting a perfect kid.  I adore my kid, just exactly as he is, who he is — even when that means three years of potty training, obsessive interest in the various outdoor lighting structures in our area, and a tendancy to fall to peices when he can’t understand someone’s motivations or restrictions.  That’s just life.  He can be extremely inflexible, and extrordinarily focused on odd details.  These are some of his quirks.  He’s also got a great sense of quirky humor, a brilliant take on math and numbers, and he’s a totally cuddly, loving little boy.  Like lots of little aspberger kids, he was a happy baby.  I know him as a happy boy.  But:  His quirks are also getting in the way of his own development, and his own happiness.   He doesn’t like falling apart when he can’t understand other peoples motivations.  He doesn’t enjoy his own inflexibility stopping him from having a good time.  He doesn’t enjoy being afraid of hubbub, or of falling — like a lot aspies, he’s clumsy and has a poor sense of space and gravity.  He doens’t enjoy being lonely, and almost ever bad dream he’s ever had has been about being alone and lonely.  He’s smart enough to know that he’s missing something, like friendship.  He may have asperger’s, but he also has emotional needs, and though he can’t quite wrap his brain around it, those needs are best and most easily met by having friends.  Though he sometimes tells me, “I don’t like to play with other kids.  I like to play alone,” I know, from observing him, that when he does play with other kids, and works at using those difficult social skills, he is always happier afterwards, more flexible, more relaxed. And someday, he will grow up.  He’ll need to be able to hold a job — so many jobs, even computer tech jobs, really rely on understanding the unspoken social contract.  He’ll also need to find friends and loved ones outside the house he grew up in — because someday, his parents will be elderly, and then gone. I adore him, just the way he is today, but if I could wave a magic wand and take away his asperber’s I would, not because I wish he was “perfect,” but because I would want to spare him the pain that asperger’s is bringing him.  Life is painful enough already. And I have to add, Asperger’s is not a mental illness.  Depression is a mental illness, and scizophrenia.  Asperger’s is a learning issue, like dyslexia.  It’s about the way the brain is wired, and the various parts of it connected.  Though a person missing a hand might be said to be impaired, they are not necessarily ill, and neither is a person with asperger’s.  The person without a hand has to learn to compensate in order to live in this world, and so does the person with asperger’s. To this end, diagnosis is very important, and the earlier the better, because a very yound mind is still developming and changing, and so is more about to learn not only coping skills, but real social skills, real social understanding.  I don’t care if he ever learns to hit a ball or shoot a basket, but I really care if he has real living friends. One unfortunate aspect of the media’s current focus on autistics who aren’t very autistic is that those who are severely autistic get short shrift. I understand that clever little geniuses who can talk and go to college and get married and have kids are much more interesting, but a lot of money and resources get channeled away from people who really need it to people who don’t. My local university, for example, sponsors a summer camp for autistics which my non-verbal severely autistic son and others like him cannot attend because he is too autistic. It ends up being filled with talented, verbal aspies. It is not an “Autism Summer Camp” as advertized, and funded, but actually a Not-Very-Autistic Summer Camp. It gets really tiring when one well-meaning person after another comes to me with the wonderful news about a summer camp supposedly for my kid. Probably the best thing to happen for the severely autistic will be when medical science admits that Aspergers is not a form of autism, but something else entirely. The autistics will get what is set aside for autistics. Bitter? Naw, just very very tired. The decoupling of labels could not come soon enough. FROM TPP — All very well stated. Thanks for making a thought-provoking contribution to the discussion. Having a child with autism, I couldn’t help but respond to Science Editor. Sadly, many parents are running quickly to the physician for why their child does not fit into their “standard of normal”. With the sudden epidemic of autism, I must wonder what is in the water. Culture plays no role in autism as it does not discriminate. Though I appreciate you candor, please know autism is a complex disorder involving difficulty with communication, behaviour concepts and expressing emotion. Oftentimes, with varied customized therapies, children “recover” well, with occasional outbursts or meltdowns. My son is 3 1/2 years old, and has high functioning autism.  One the one hand, I welcome the surge of public awareness of autism spectrum disorders.   When my son flaps his arms in public, or hums persistently, or starts counting objects  (past 100), or any of the many odd behaviors typical of an autistic child, I am grateful that many more people are aware of what they are seeing.  I still get odd stares, but as yet, no one has felt the need to approach me and make an inappropriate comment. The downside seems to be that, since so many people have read about Asperger’s and the apparent increase in ASDs  (increase in incidence?  or just the diagnosis of ASDs?), I get well meaning comments that since I am an older mom with the means and the education to demand a diagnosis, I am doing so to cope with a less-than-ideal child.  That somehow, the ASD diagnosis is something I sought to explain away my less than perfect child.  That line of reasoning is  offensive to me.  It is false on its face…I love – adore –  and accept my son as he is, but he quite obviously has behavioral differences from his neurotypical peers that place him at risk of being unemployable in the future.   Any responsible parent would deal directly with the issue – get an evaluation, make a plan of treatment, and help the child attain the necessary skills to live as independent a life as possible in adulthood. I hold these supposedly well-meaning comments with the same contempt I hold for the ignorant comments made last summer by Michael Savage.  Savage, a radio commentator, stated he thought autistic kids were putting on an act and simply needed their fathers to tell them to stop.  So, my son cannot connect with peers or hold a real conversation because I was inadequately firm with him as a parent?   Or he has these issues because I seek a label to explain away my role in his differences.  (I not only accept him, I admire him.  He may have cognitive difficulties, but he also has an extraordinarily high IQ. So the “just-can’t accept your slow child” line of reasoning just does not hold.) ) It sounds to me like these are all manifestations of the same idiotic child development theory that called mothers of autistics “refrigerator mothers,” and blamed the kid’s behaviors on the moms in the 1970s and 80s.   This is a neurological disorder, and the basic biology need to be understood, and real biological treatments need to arise out of that understanding.   Anything less is a clear violation of the human rights of an entire group of citizens. Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
