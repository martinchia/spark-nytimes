 Many dog owners regard their furry friends as their children, and talk to them accordingly. Now, a new study reports that dogs, like infants, are able to study minor details in human communication and correctly interpret intent. Researchers from Hungary published the study in the journal Current Biology. They presented dogs with two videos. In the first, a woman says, “Hi, dog,” while looking straight at the camera. The woman then turns her head toward a container. The dog follows her gaze. However, when the woman is looking down, rather than at the camera, as she says, “Hi, dog,” the dog does not follow her subsequent gaze. Dogs pick up on the subtle difference in the woman’s behavior in the two situations, said Adam Miklosi, a behavioral biologist at Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest and one of the study’s authors.

Other studies have shown that infants have the same ability to interpret an adult’s intent. “Dogs are functionally similar to a 6-month-old, to a 1-year-old,” Dr. Miklosi said, “though how the dog mind is dealing with the problem, we don’t really know, and it’s probably different from an infant.” Advertisement Dogs presumably gained this ability over generations of domestication. “Being in a human family gives the dogs the ability to interact in a human way,” Dr. Miklosi said. “You can really treat your dog as a sort of infant, which you wouldn’t really do with a goat or another domesticated animal.” A version of this article appears in print on January 10, 2012, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: Reading Body Language, Dogs Are Like Infants.
