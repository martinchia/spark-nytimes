 Can where you live play a role in how much you weigh? A new study finds that it can, and reports that people who live in older neighborhoods appear less likely to be overweight. The key, the researchers say, is walkability. Older communities are more likely to encourage people to drive less and walk more, which can help keep weight down. The study, which is to appear in the September issue of The American Journal of Preventive Medicine, looked at the fitness and address information of more than 450,000 residents of Salt Lake County in Utah. With each extra decade of a neighborhood’s age, the researchers said, the risk of obesity was 13 percent lower for men and 8 percent lower for women.

Smith of the University of Utah:  better sidewalks, trees to provide shade and intersections at shorter intervals.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

But older neighborhoods have something even more basic when it comes to luring someone into heading out on foot. “You always want to have something to walk to,” Dr. Smith said. And unlike many modern residential areas, older communities may have stores and other businesses near houses.

That  does not necessarily affect their weight directly, but it does mean  the neighborhood is a good one for walking.
