 To the Editor: Re “Golfing Through the Stratosphere” (June 16): Miniature golf has a long and honorable history as a tool to present ideas and concepts. The last such exhibition I remember was at the Academy of Sciences in Philadelphia, some years ago. The tragedy of exhibition as an educational tool is that it has no formal, recorded history, so new techniques are repeatedly tried, found successful, then forgotten, only to be reinvented years later and presented as “original.” They surely are original to their recreators and designers, who have never been taught the history of their discipline.
