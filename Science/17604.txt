 Prolonged breast-feeding is widely believed to protect infants against developing eczema and other allergic diseases. But a new study has found no evidence for the belief. Researchers in Britain gathered data on more than 50,000 children ages 8 to 12 in 21 countries, assessing the prevalence and severity of eczema with skin examinations of the children, family medical histories and questionnaires about past symptoms. The children also received skin-prick tests for common allergens. Even among children who had been breast-fed for six months or longer, there was no evidence that breast-feeding prevented eczema or limited its severity. The results were the same for children whose mothers had a history of allergy and for those who had a positive reaction to the allergens used in the skin-prick test. In more affluent countries, breast-feeding actually was associated with a slight increase in the risk for eczema. The researchers suspect that this is because mothers who see an allergic reaction in an infant may try to breast-feed longer, not because breast-feeding causes the allergy. “We’re not questioning the benefits of breast-feeding,” said Carsten Flohr, the lead author and a senior lecturer in pediatrics at Kings College London. “But when it comes to prevention of eczema, neither breast-feeding itself nor prolonged breast-feeding seems to be protective.” The study appears online in The British Journal of Dermatology. A version of this article appears in print on August 30, 2011, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Nutrition: Breast-Feeding Does Not Prevent Eczema.
