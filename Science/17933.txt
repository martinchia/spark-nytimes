 To the Editor: In your spotlight on game design as the future of learning (Voices, Nov. 9), Jane McGonigal conflates authentic, unadulterated play with the isolation and addictive byproducts of game play. Kids may be able to use their minds and move deftly playing a virtual game, but in nature the survival of a species that cannot move or defend itself is seriously at risk. Regardless of how wonderfully designed the game, endless hours of computer play is a road young minds and their parents can ill afford. Jeffrey L. Peyton Richmond, Va.
