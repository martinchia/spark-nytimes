 Premature babies are often given hydrocortisone as a substitute for cortisol, an essential hormone that helps fight inflammation and prevent lung disease. But a new study suggests that the medicine offers little benefit. Researchers writing in the October issue of Pediatrics used data from a study of adrenal insufficiency that randomly assigned 311 babies born, on average, about three months prematurely and weighing 1.6 pounds. They received either hydrocortisone treatment or a placebo in the two weeks after birth. Low cortisol levels before treatment began were not associated with increased mortality, and at five to seven days there was no difference between the two groups in chronic lung disease, infection, brain hemorrhage or vision problems. Mortality was slightly higher in those with increasing levels of cortisol, but the association was not statistically significant. “The good news is that the treatment isn’t harmful,” said the lead author, Dr. Susan W. Aucott, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins. “But we probably don’t need to use it as much as we’re using it. If the baby is doing well, he doesn’t need treatment just because his cortisol level is low.” A report in the Vital Signs column on Tuesday about a new study that suggests the synthetic compound hydrocortisone offers little benefit for premature babies misstated the chemical’s function. Hydrocortisone is intended as a substitute for cortisol, a hormone that is ordinarily produced by the adrenal gland; it does not provoke the gland to produce more cortisol.
