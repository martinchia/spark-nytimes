 For the next few weeks youâll be hearing a lot from me about a conference I attended in March at the Culinary Institute of America in Napa Valley. Called âHealthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives,â this conference, presented by the Culinary Institute of America, the Harvard School of Public Health and the Samueli Institute, brings together medical professionals with chefs and  nutrition researchers  to explore food and its relationship to health. Now in its 10th year, the conference has inspired hospitals  to install teaching kitchens. Surgeons whose knowledge of knives had been limited to the scalpel have learned to wield a chefâs knife as they participate in kitchen workshops run by chefs from the Culinary Institute  and chefs presenting at the conference. Whole grains, legumes, nuts and vegetables were the focus of most of the cooking demonstrations by the likes of Joyce Goldstein, Suvir Saran, John Ash, Iliana de la Vega, Mollie Katzen, Barton Seaver, Patrick Clark, Aaron Brown and the conference co-director, Dr. David Eisenberg of Harvard (along with his very charming 17-year-old daughter, Naomi). This, of course, was right up my alley, and as always I came home with many new ideas. One frequent message in the cooking demonstrations was that fresh herbs, if you use them in quantity, are as much a green vegetable as, say, broccoli. This can be especially reassuring during the seasons when fresh green vegetables are in short supply. I took this to heart with the salads Iâm presenting this week; theyâre packed with herbs. At this time of year I can also include the enticing spring vegetables that are hitting the farmersâ markets, so I roasted asparagus and artichokes and served them alongside the grains in two of this weekâs salads, and served another one on a bed of spinach. All of the salads can be served as main dishes; they are great keepers, so make some over the weekend and use  them for  lunch throughout the week. Rainbow Quinoa Salad With Mixed Nuts, Herbs and Dried Fruit: This salad is inspired by one demonstrated at the âHealthy Kitchen, Healthy Livesâ conference in Napa Valley. Barley and Herb Salad With Roasted Asparagus: This can be a main-dish salad or a side, enlivened with intensely delicious roasted asparagus. Bulgur and Chickpea Salad With Roasted Artichokes: Quartering and roasting the artichokes instead of steaming them whole intensifies flavor and cuts down on preparation time for this salad. Red and Basmati or Jasmine Rice With Peanuts, Asian Dressing and Baked Tofu: With a little advance preparation, this spicy salad can be made in 30 minutes.  Middle Eastern Black Rice and Lentil Salad on a Bed of Spinach: The hues of this crunchy salad indicate that itâs an antioxidant-rich dish.
