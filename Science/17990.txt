 THE FACTS Despite concerns about its effectiveness, the childhood tonsillectomy is common. Each year more than half a million children in the United States have their tonsils removed. But scientists have noticed what appears to be an unexpected side effect: Children who have the surgery are at greater risk of becoming overweight. At first glance it makes little sense. Tonsils are typically removed after they become enlarged from repeated infections. Why would that have any effect on weight? One theory is that enlarged tonsils cause difficulty swallowing, prompting a child to eat less. Once the tonsils are removed, appetite returns. No one knows how to explain it, but studies show a link between the surgery and weight gain. In the most recent and exhaustive report, published this year in the journal Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery, researchers analyzed data from 11 studies, following 1,549 children for up to seven years. Obviously, the children put on weight as they aged, but the analysis showed that the gains were much greater than expected after the surgery and greater than the weight gain in children who had not had their tonsils removed.

THE BOTTOM LINE   Studies show tonsillectomies are associated with weight gain, but it’s not clear there’s a causal relationship.
