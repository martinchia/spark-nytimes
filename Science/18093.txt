 When it comes to carbon balance, some rivers are doing the world a favor. In areas of high erosion, a river carries bits of soil and vegetation to the sea. Those bits contain much organic carbon, converted from atmospheric carbon dioxide by plants, so if they end up at the bottom of the ocean, the river has served as the transport mechanism for a huge carbon sink. The key to the process is high rates of erosion, and the highest erosion rates occur during severe storms. So Robert G. Hilton of the University of Cambridge in England and colleagues looked at the effects of typhoons on a river in Taiwan, the LiWu. Like many other Asian rivers, it runs through forested, mountainous country, areas subject to much erosion. The researchers found that the concentration of particulate organic carbon in the river water increased greatly during flooding caused by two typhoons in 2004. These floods also produced huge quantities of sediment from erosion of rocks, which has the effect of helping to bury the organic matter on the ocean floor. In a report in Nature Geoscience, the researchers calculate that the typhoon effect is so great that over several decades, almost all of the transport of organic carbon by the river occurs during storm-caused floods. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: An Upside to Floods: Rivers Act as Transport For Huge Carbon Sinks.
