In the latest Recipes for Health, Martha Rose Shulman creates smoothies for grown-up tastes. Using ingredients commonly found in salads or on a dinner plate, Ms. Shulman creates unique and refreshing smoothies that can work as a snack or a meal. I never thought about adding vegetables to smoothies until I tasted a lunchtime smoothie my sister made that included spinach, pear and walnuts. These are ingredients I like in a salad, and it turns out they still work well together after taking a trip through the blender â especially with fresh ginger added to the mix. So this week I explored fruit and vegetable smoothies. Iâd picked several pounds of oranges from a friendâs tree, so I used fresh orange juice as the liquid, and for each drink I combined one or two fruits with a vegetable. I didnât use bananas, which so often go into my smoothies, as I donât really like them with orange juice, and I didnât add dairy to many of them. I was thinking the smoothies would make great snacks, but in fact these make satisfying meals. When I was testing and tasting, they were all I needed for breakfast and lunch. Theyâre packed with vitamins, especially C and A, beta carotene, and antioxidant-rich flavonoids. Here are five new ways to make fruit and vegetable smoothies. Pear and Arugula Smoothie With Ginger and Walnuts: Arugula may seem like a strange ingredient for a smoothie, but this combination is a real winner, a great lunchtime smoothie. Arugula PiÃ±a Colada Smoothie: Pineapple and coconut milk are traditional partners in piÃ±a colada, so why not combine them in something thatâs really good for you in this lunchtime smoothie? Pineapple, Orange, Granola and Carrot Smoothie: A small amount of granola contributes great texture to this tangy smoothie. Mixed Berry and Beet Smoothie: The color alone is enough to cause cravings for this smoothie. Red Berry, Cabbage and Almond Smoothie: A high-anthocyanin red smoothie that also delivers the benefits of red cabbage, a cruciferous vegetable high in antioxidant-rich sulfur compounds, and almonds, a very good source of manganese and vitamin E.
