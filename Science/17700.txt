 Modern crocodiles have conical teeth they use to grab at prey. Sometime the crocodiles rip off pieces of flesh from their prey, and sometimes they swallow their victims whole. They do not, however, chew their food, as humans and many other mammals do. But crocodiles that lived 144 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period, had the dental structure to allow for chewing, scientists report in the journal Nature. The researchers say they discovered a virtually complete skull and skeleton of such a crocodile in southwestern Tanzania. “It has a very mammalianlike dental organization,” said Patrick M. O'Connor, a paleontologist at Ohio University and the study’s lead author. “What really blew us away were the molarlike teeth in the back of the jaw, with a series of crests and troughs that actually interlocked to help the crocodile eat food.” Advertisement The crocodile, known as Pakasuchus, was much smaller than today’s version. An adult was about the size of a house cat, with a head less than three inches long. Advertisement Pakasuchus is one of several species of crocodiles from the time period thought to have a mammalian dental structure. The crocodiles lived in Gondwana, a landmass that included present-day Africa, Antarctica, Australia, India and South America. Fossils of other crocodile species have been found in Africa and South America, but the new fossil is the most complete piece to date, Dr. O’Connor said. The crocodiles became extinct probably around 65 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous. A version of this article appears in print on August 10, 2010, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: Crocodile Fossil Reveals Teeth of a Mammal.
