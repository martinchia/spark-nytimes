Some small studies have suggested that oral contraceptive use may be associated with an increased risk of birth defects, possibly by altering vitamin levels in the blood. But a large new study has found that taking oral contraceptives around the time of pregnancy did not increase the risk. The study, in BMJ, used records of 880,694 infants born in Denmark over 14 years, through March 2011. Danish records include dates of prescriptions for oral contraceptives, and researchers divided women into four groups: those who never used the pill, those who stopped more than three months before pregnancy, those who stopped less than three months before, and those who were taking the pill when they became pregnant. The number of birth defects per 1,000 births was consistent: 25.1 for those who never used the pill, 25.0 for use more than three months before pregnancy, 24.9 for use 0 to 3 months before pregnancy, and 24.8 for those who became pregnant while using the pill. âOur results are especially reassuring since we used approaches that previous research did not,â said the lead author, Brittany M. Charlton, an instructor at Harvard Medical School. âMost previous studies have relied on women recalling contraceptive use, but we had the registries. This eliminates any recall bias.â A version of this article appears in print on 01/12/2016, on page D4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Childbirth: u2018The Pillu2019 Cleared in Birth Defects.
