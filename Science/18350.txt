 To the Editor: In John Tierney’s mock letter to Al Gore, “The Aria of Prince Algorino” (Findings, June 17), he writes, “I agree it would ‘round out the résumé’ of Prince Algorino in the opening scene if he were to sing about his creation of a communications network. But the ‘Mio magnifico Internet’ aria you propose seems to me a distraction.” The only way to make sense of this remark is to take it as ridiculing Mr. Gore for claiming to invent the Internet. But he never made any such claim, despite a widespread belief that he did. Mr. Tierney is entitled to his opinions, however misguided they are. But he is not entitled to spread a demonstrable falsehood about Mr. Gore — even if it is a convenient untruth. David N. TostensonGainesville, Fla. Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
