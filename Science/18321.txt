 A veterinarian in Australia has been hospitalized in critical condition after exposure to the rare Hendra virus, according to local reports, which said he fell ill after treating two dying horses on a Queensland stud farm. The virus was found in 1994 and has never been seen outside Australia since its discovery in Hendra, a Brisbane suburb. There have been only a dozen outbreaks, but the virus has proved lethal to horses and to humans caring for them. About 70 percent of the horses infected have died, and so have three of the six people known to have caught it from them — a veterinarian, a farmer and a prominent horse trainer, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Hendra, a paramyxovirus like mumps or measles, is most closely related to Nipah virus, discovered in Malaysia in 1999 after it spread from pigs to pig farmers and caused encephalitis and pneumonia. Both infections resemble the flu at first, but can proceed to breathing problems and seizures, then coma and death. Both Hendra and Nipah are carried by the large fruit-eating bats known as flying foxes, which are thought to spread it when their urine, saliva or droppings get into animal feed. Humans catch the viruses from exposure to the blood and secretions of sick animals. There has been no known instance of a human’s passing Hendra to another human, or to a horse. There is no vaccine against the disease, but health authorities are trying to make one. There is also no cure, though patients are sometimes treated with ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug.
