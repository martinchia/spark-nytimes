 Babies cannot swallow vitamin pills, but in the developing world, there are many who need the nutritional boost that vitamins can provide. So Dr. Stanley Zlotkin, a physician in Toronto, came up with Sprinkles — vitamins for infants and toddlers in a flavorless powdered form that can be sprinkled into any cooked food. For a couple of dollars a year, the powders can prevent disorders caused by vitamin and mineral deficiencies. The powder was first widely distributed in Mongolia in 2001. Today there are also formulations of Sprinkles for older children and adults, and now similar nutritional powders are made by a variety of manufacturers. In 2010, about 350,000 people received micronutrient packets, according to the World Food Program. The organization has distributed micronutrient powders in seven countries, including Ghana, Afghanistan and the Dominican Republic, and it hopes to distribute packets to 1.3 million children next year, said Martin Bloem, the chief of nutrition at the World Food Program.
