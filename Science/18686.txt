 How do you find a great place to eat? Referrals from trusted friends, or by following crowds to new hot spots? Australasian gannets trust the wisdom of crowds, a new study reports. Mark E. Hauber, an animal behaviorist at Hunter College in New York, and his colleagues used video recordings and tiny GPS tags to trace the routes of birds in a large gannet colony in New Zealand. The researchers were trying to discover how the birds share information about sources of fish. Initially, the team believed that the gannets were somehow communicating their foraging tips during an elaborate bill-fencing ceremony performed when reuniting with mates. But the real action, it turned out, was at the colony’s communal bathing site. “They go to these bathing rafts, wash their feathers and clean up,” Dr. Hauber said. “And it looks like they are also using it as some sort of public exchange of information.” The gannets appear to locate food by carefully watching others come and go while cleaning up. Dr. Hauber and his colleagues found that about 70 percent of the birds leaving the bathing site flew in the direction of colleagues returning from foraging or flying out to forage. The research appeared in the current issue of Animal Cognition.   A version of this article appears in print on December 24, 2013, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Birds: Best Places for Seafood? Follow a Gannet.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
