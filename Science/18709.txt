“It’s probably just stress.” How many times have you uttered those words to yourself to dismiss a headache, pain or illness? But stress is not âjustâ some benign complaint. Instead, it’s a powerful risk factor for disease, notes a recent commentary in The Journal of the American Medical Association. The article focuses on evidence showing that stress is linked to an increased risk for heart attacks, depression, cancer and the progression of H.I.V. and AIDS. Notably, an accompanying article in JAMA notes that workplace stress may be as bad for your heart as smoking and high cholesterol. And marital strife also poses a major risk to your heart health, the Archives of Internal Medicine reported this week. One reason stress is such a problem is that it triggers bad habits like overeating, lack of sleep, smoking and drinking. âItâs hard to pull stress apart from other things, because stress triggers many of the standard risk factors like smoking and poor diet,ââ says Sheldon Cohen, psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon University and lead author of the JAMA commentary. âBut it may be really quite an important predictor of health.ââ Stress also has a more insidious effect, releasing stress hormones such as cortisol that can weaken the bodyâs immune defenses. In a series of studies at Carnegie Mellon, researchers asked volunteers about the stress in their lives and then injected them with a cold virus. Most of the people who had reported very little chronic stress didnât get sick â their immune systems rallied against the virus. But volunteers who said they’d experienced chronic stress for a month or longer were at far higher risk of falling ill. Now thereâs a growing body of research that shows the healthiest agers are those who are adept at shedding stress. In one series of German studies, researchers have induced stress in volunteers by having them speak in public while trying to solve difficult math problems. The task is typically tough on everyone the first time they do it, and saliva samples from volunteers show high levels of cortisol. Eventually, most volunteers get used to the task and cortisol levels drop. But some of the subjects are unable to shake off their excess stress, and the studies show their cortisol levels stay elevated.  Exercise is an obvious way to shed stress, but for some people daily stress relief comes in simple steps like making time to play with your kids, watching a favorite television show or taking a hot bath. Since the worst kind of stress is chronic, the key is to focus on stress relief every day, and not just on weekends, say stress researchers. To learn more about stress and the toll it takes on your health, one of my favorite health books is Robert Sapolskyâs “Why Zebras Donât Get Ulcers.” The short answer is that zebras have a lot of stress because they have to flee from lions on a regular basis, but after the crisis they mostly just graze calmly. People, on the other hand, spend too much of their downtime worrying about the lions in their lives. Comments are no longer being accepted. Zebras don’t get bombarded with conflicting reports about health risks.   Now we can all read this and stress about whether or not we have too much stress! Dear Sir,
Anxiety and Pheochromocytomas.
 Pheochromocytomas (pheo) are relatively rare, usually benign tumors that arise from chromaffin cells of the sympathoadrenal system. Most pheos secrete epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Some of them contain other amines, such as vasoactive intestinal peptide, serotonin, ACTH, somatostatin, opioid peptides, alpha-MSH, calcitonin (particularly in MEN II and III), parathyroid-like hormone, and neuropeptide Y (a potent vasoconstrictor). The diverse manifestations produced by release of these substances can confuse the diagnosis and suggest a psychiatric disorder. This is because pheos, with their abundant secretion of cathecolamines, alter mental functions in the same way an exogenous drug can do. In so doing, they produce attacks of panic, anguish, anxiety, rage, and sometimes, erectile dysfunction in males. This organic cause of anxiety is rarely mentionned and extremely dangerous as pheos can be highly lethal.
Pierre Jacomet Stress is not a good term for this problem because it implies it is only the âbad stuffâ that is causing harm. I prefer the term âconstant adrenergic arousalâ which means the adrenal glands and the sympathetic (emergency) nervous system are turned on far more often and for longer periods of time than is healthy for modern humans.
The common term, âflight or fight responseâ is appropriate if a burglar has invaded your home or there is a fire at your place of work and you have to evacuate the office. True emergencies like this are rare among the middle and upper middle classes. They are over and done within a few minutes or a few hours.
Much more common are the situations we get ourselves into by choice. For many of us these are daily. Studying for final exams, screaming at the Friday night football game when your sonâs team is behind, the daily commute to the office in New York City, watching â24â Monday nights on TV, multi-tasking mothers (almost a clichÃ© these days) with 3 kids in school, a demanding husband and a challenging full time job. And active in the PTA. And dealing with a difficult mother-in-law. Most of us are âadrenalin junkiesâ. We choose to watch Nascar and Mission Impossible. Many people find it difficult to wind down at the end of a demanding day without alcohol or illicit drugs.
Our societyâs response to this has been more and more ads on TV for prescription medicines to treat restless legs, insomnia, heartburn, high blood pressure, constipation, anxiety and depression, erectile dysfunction, various eating disorders, skin and even heart problems. Adrenergic arousal contributes to all of these medical problems.
We share common genes, our physiology and dietary needs are similar to those of our primitive ancestors, the Paleolithic humans from 10,000 years ago. Yet we live and eat far, far differently. Primitive man had no light after the sun went down so he looked up at the stars and wondered what they meant. If he got excited, that meant he was getting ready to chase, run away or stand and fight. Primitive humans had a lot of âdown timeâ. Modern humans need much more of it.
I recommend on my fabulous new website, nomoremedicines.com, the best most relaxing type of exercise is walking your dog. If you donât have a dog, go to the pound and rescue one. God smiles on those who rescue dogs. I walk my two rescue dogs for Â½ hour twice a day, 7 days a week. That is one of the reasons that at an age (73 years old and counting) when most men are dead or sick, I am neither. In fact, I am at the top of my game. If I can do it, so can you. As someone who also believes that normal neuroendocrine responses driven to extremes by modern living/modern stresses are the root cause of many common health problems of today. These are health problems that society likes to treat symptomatically with drugs while almost deliberately ignoring the root causes. I would like to say bravo to Dr Bennett for expressing his viewpoint.  I hope I can stay as healthy and active well into my 70’s and beyond. great article What I am wondering is this: based upon everything said here, is it possible to reverse the long term effects of chronic stress? For the last twelve years I have been through repeated Job loss–while being the only real breadwinner–divorce, the loss of a parent, and most recently the final end of a very painful but long end to a relationship. It feels like I have had no respite from it all. I am not so much worried about the past as the future. Can I reduce the effects of the past on my future health based upon what we know?
Jeff Brown Chicago Non-stress or what I call “constructive stress” is when you CREATe your own experiences.  Stress or what I call “destructive stress” is when you take on the same knee-jerk REACTions that we’re enculturated with since birth (example: if someone cuts you off in traffic, you scream and honk and your blood pressure goes up). The former requires stepping outside of your comfort zone — and it creates awareness about your human experience as well as the human experience as a whole. It’s what I think is the true definition of the power of LOVE. The latter requires robotic, victim-centered thinking and it separates you from others as well as your own ability to fulfill whatever true inner desires you’d like to experience in life. When these desires are surpressed, your body will manifest disease and physical illness. Awareness/consciousness is the destination where diet, exercise, meditation, journaling, therapy, self-care roads lead to. And robust, turn-the-clock-back health is just a by-product of awareness/consciousness.  Good habits such as diet, exercise, etc, will take you far, but if you lose awareness, they can become monsters in of themselves. This is much like exercise becoming bulimia, diet becoming anorexia, and belief becoming behaviorism. Often egoism masquarades as morality and reactions are merely Pavlovian. My own experience is that I once took a daily pill for hypothyroidism, needed to wear glasses/contact lenses for myopia, had a multitude of allergies, not to mention, I had developed cysts the size of oranges on a yearly basis. For whatever it’s worth (and I know in the science world it’s  considered anecdotal), I am free of all of the above, can’t remember the last time I’ve been sick, and am not affected by jet-lag to boot. I approach my 40s looking like I’m in my 20s. Regardless my personal health history, you’ll start reading more and more articles like this one. You have your own life, I suggest you start experimenting in your own “laboratory” and see where it takes you… Your article is a wonderful inspiration to me as a meditation teacher.  Every day I have the opportunity to help people relax.  I explain to them that stress simply wears us down.  It erodes our immune systems and can make us feel like we are on a treadmill instead of a wonderful journey.  We are stressed all the time and stress presents itself in so many ways.  Sometimes obviously like financial worries and health concerns, but other times more quietly like time going by and losing track of our lives.  When things get hectic it is especially useful to meditate.  Studies show that just ten to twenty minutes a day of quiet reflection can bring relief from chronic stress as well as increase tolerance to stress.  77% of individuals with high levels of stress were able to calm down, lower their blood pressure and cholesterol levels, simply by training themselves to stay calm. Â Whatâs important to point out is how easy it is to meditate–as easy as breathing.Â  People often imagine someone sitting cross-legged on a mountaintop in India. But for most, meditation doesn’t fit this stereotypical image.Â  It is rather a simple daily practice, done at home sitting on the couch, or at the office on lunch break.  It helps us keep our balance,  find our center and stay present even when things are difficult–especially when things are difficult–which is just what we need in todayâs multi-tasking world. Zebras don’t read The New York Times! I have seen many situations where stress clearly led to major illness, and death, in people’s lives.  Chronic stress wears down your immune system and leaves you vulnerable, there is no doubt in my mind.  Consequently, when I have stressful situations in my life, I now know that taking extremely good physical care of myself at such times is vital, especially in terms of eating a nutrient-rich diet (lots of fresh foods) and exercising so that I burn off nervous energy and sleep well.  Of course, I should do this when things are going well, but I know now it’s really important to do it in times of duress.  Also, it can be hard to socialize when we are stressed– but I have learned it’s important to get out with a good friend, when I think I can least afford the time.  It pulls me out of the vortex when I am overwhelmed. The stress busters:
1. Look within
2. Analyze what has caused it
3. Do not sit on it
4. Begin to solve it
5. Seek help
6. Nothing is permanent
7. So why worry- Life is not worth it
8. Divert attention for a while The example of Zebra grazinf quitely after a chase by a lion is very fitting. I loved your article!  For me, a particular kind of exercise is the way I get rid of stress .  The ancients knew this and they refined their “longevity workouts” to short bursts of spinning energy practiced every day.  Now, amazingly, Jennifer Kries’s Waking Energy is a re=invention of those ancient longevity techniques.  Since I started “spinning” with her dvd I feel calm and alive and indomitable!!!   Children, work, traffic, nothing bothers me!!! I am 57 years old, have had tremendous stress for the last ll years, non-stop, along with a bad diet and little exercise (in my younger days, exercised avidly and at well).  I am about 25 lbs. overweight and have recently started walking and practising Yoga (last week).  I have always been healthy, but recently I notice my blood pressure has been a little above normal, and I am suffering from fibromyalgia, though it doesn’t stop me.  Is it too late?

eds note: It’s never too late to take care of yourself. study after study shows that changes like weight loss and exercise make a meaningful difference in your health no matter what your age. good luck to you tpp The Rx for a healthier, happier life is so simple — and critics, I’ve heard the countering gloom a million times before. Too busy, stressed etc. Bah. The Rx is this: Turn off the darn electronics, get into nature or into the “marketplace” of life — the corner coffeeshop, for instance, have a joyful dinner with family or with friends as often as possible I(begin it with grace or just simple words of gratitude), don’t allow your workplace to rule your mind and heart(at least do not bring it home), cut out the smoking, get some exercise suitable to your health status, weight and age, breathe deeply and grin when you feel anxiety coming on, listen to gentle music, smile a lot, say hello to the cashier, walk the dog again. That’s it. Before you knock it, give it a try. If you don’t try it, you’ll never know. I teach meditation and have seen what some healthy, absolutely free changes in lifestyle can bring about. I’ve seen it in my own life. I agree with many of the above comments that diet, exercise, caring for others (including a pet), socializing, etc., is very important to help the body manage stress.  But, I find that the single MOST important thing one can do that directly affects how the brain works (remember, it’s physically and chemically attached to the rest of our body) is to meditate.  I have had to learn this the hard way by nearly dying of stress induced ulcers which perforated major stomach arteries last September— a very scarey experience which put me in the hospital for 8 weeks, 6 of those in intensive care.  I was 48, previously had NO stomach or digestive problems whatsoever, ate nutritiously and am of normal build and weight, took my vitamins, did not smoke or drink, and exercised at the gym regularly.  However, when one’s brain is in overdrive, nothing will really help as much as tackling the root cause of the stress itself, i.e. how your brain manufactures and handles it.  This is how meditation works.  I now meditate once a day for 20 min and am becoming much better at handling stress.  And, if I start obsessing over something I realistically have little control over, I can more easily say to myself, “Let it go.”  I recommend the book “The Relaxation Response” by Herbert Benson, MD. I find that deep prayer is a wonderful way to deal with any kind of stress which may be going on in my life.  When I give all my cares to the One who cares for me, it just allows me to relax.  People usually mention meditation, and that’s wonderful too, but prayer is just as effective and powerful. I find that deep prayer is a wonderful stress reliever – just as effective and powerful as meditation.  Giving thanks at the beginning of each day to God, choosing to receive all His goodness into my life. Having a conversation with the One who cares for me about the day ahead or any concerns, is a stress buster.  In the evening, reviewing my day, expressing gratitude, praying for others and lifting up any new concerns in prayer relaxes me. I have received and given over in prayer.  Now I am positioned for a restful, refreshing sleep, which greatly helps my body to fight off stress as well. #16, 17  Mildred.  The point you bring up is that the imagination is a powerful tool.  FOcusing your thoughts has powerful effects.  Meditation  works as a centering practice without applyng a faith in the existance of a diety, surrogate father, brother, ruler….  When people tell me they have prayed for me I thank them for the positive energy. Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
