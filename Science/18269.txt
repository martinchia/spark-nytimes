 Q. What happened to the golf ball the astronaut hit on the Moon? Why did he hit it?  A. Alan Shepard actually hit two balls on the Apollo 14 mission of 1971, and they are still on the Moon, he said in a 1991 interview on the Academy of Achievement Web site for students. He was looking for a way to demonstrate what the Moon’s lack of atmosphere and much smaller gravitational force would mean for a familiar Earthbound activity, he said. “Being a golfer,” he said, “I thought if I could just get a club up there, and get it going through the ball at the same speed, that it would go six times as far as it would have gone here on Earth.” So with NASA’s permission, he designed a club head to fit on the handle of the device the astronauts used to  scoop up dust samples. (The collapsible club was brought back to Earth and became the property of the United States Golf Association.) Before the flight, he practiced using it in a space suit and made a deal that if the mission went well, “then the last thing I was going to do, before climbing up the ladder to come home, was to whack these two golf balls.” “It was a one-handed 6 iron because it was very clumsy with our suits,” he said in an interview in 1994.  “The first one I shanked. The ball came off the handle and it rolled into a crater 40 yards away. The next one I hit pretty flush. Here it would have gone 30 yards, but because there’s no atmosphere there, it went about 200 yards.” An answer in the Q&A column on Oct. 14 about what became of the golf balls the astronaut Alan Shepard hit on the Moon, drawing on an interview Shepard gave in 1991, misstated the timing and details of another demonstration that showed an almost complete absence of air resistance on the Moon. It was the astronaut David Scott, not “other astronauts,” who did the demonstration, and he dropped a feather and a hammer that fell at the same speed, not a feather and a lead ball. That demonstration took place during the Apollo 15 mission in July 1971, which was after  not before  Shepard’s Apollo 14 mission, in February 1971.
