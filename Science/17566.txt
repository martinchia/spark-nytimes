 Women are more likely than men to die after heart surgery, and one reason may be the use of a common medical procedure: blood transfusions. Researchers, writing in the December issue of The Journal of Women’s Health, reported on 150 women and 230 men who had heart surgery in 1997 and 1998. A low hematocrit, or concentration of red blood cells, is an indication for transfusion, and women generally have lower hematocrits than men. Even after controlling for pre-operation hematocrit, age, body mass index and general health, the odds that a woman would receive blood were more than 21 times that of men. Women were also more likely to be infected, have breathing problems, spend more time in intensive care and die in the hospital. The risk of a poor outcome was greatest in those receiving the most blood.

The authors suggest that the path to increased mortality for women begins here. Dr. Neil Blumberg, a co-author of the study and a professor of laboratory medicine at the University of Rochester, said patients should insist on leukoreduced blood if they needed transfusions.
