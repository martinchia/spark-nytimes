 To the Editor: Re “No Surprise for Bisexual Men: Report Indicates They Exist” (Aug. 23): This piece shows that researchers seem to hold the common belief that same-sex and opposite-sex emotional and erotic attractions are based essentially on the same kinds of feelings for members of both sexes. However, from my experience attending conferences on bisexuality, it is clear that many bisexuals feel entirely different attractions for men from those that they feel for women. This, of course, allows for the possibility that bisexuals might find themselves attracted to and in love with a man and a woman at the same time — not something that proponents of the marriage tradition want to reckon with right now as same-sex marriage is so much in question.
