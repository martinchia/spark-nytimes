 To the Editor: Dr. J. Allan Hobson’s claim that “dreams are tuning the mind for conscious awareness” (“A Dream Interpretation: Tuneups for the Brain,” Mind, Nov. 10) overlooks the fact that for numerous writers, artists and scientists, dreaming has been an integral part of their creative process. The unique symbolic interplay afforded by dreams allows them to resolve certain issues in their work in a way that might not be possible or as effective while they are awake. James W. Hamilton,  M.D. Santa Fe, N.M. The writer, a psychiatrist, is the author of the new book “Life and Art: The Creative Synthesis.” Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
