 To the Editor: “Troves of Personal Data, Forbidden to Researchers” (May 22) brought to mind my service in the late 1980s on the research proposal evaluation committee at my university. The committee examined many aspects of these proposals, but one received intense discussion. That was the effort to ensure that research subjects were provided with information and assurances of fair treatment and privacy so they were able to give researchers their truly “informed consent.” It seems appropriate for anyone demanding access to others’ data to first conduct the informed consent process to earn the trust such access requires. Respect for subjects is vital for getting the data that researchers value so highly. Kenneth S. Davidson Farmington Hills, Mich. Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
