Before the final launching of the space shuttle Endeavor, in front of the Village Inn, where photographs of past space shuttle crews hang in the dining room, drivers will abandon their cars up and down Route 1, the main street of Titusville, Fla. When the countdown begins, all eyes will turn toward the Kennedy Space Center, where, if the weather allows, the shuttle Endeavour will thunder into the sky, carrying six astronauts on a two-week mission to the International Space Station.
