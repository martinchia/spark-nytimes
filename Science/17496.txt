 Ex-smokers are known to have a tendency to gain weight. But a new study suggests that the amount they gain is greater than many experts believed. The study, in the current Health Services Research, found that smokers may gain about 20 pounds when they quit. Earlier research put the gain at 5 to 15 pounds. The researchers — Daniel Eisenberg of the University of Michigan and Brian C. Quinn of the University of California, Berkeley — arrived at their conclusion after coming up with what they described as a better analytical model for comparing the weight gain among smokers and ex-smokers. Among other things, the model tries to take better account of differences in overall health attitudes of those who still smoke and those who have stopped. When the researchers took another look at an earlier study in which the health of more than 5,800 smokers and former smokers was followed for five years, they found that the ex-smokers appeared to have gained more weight than first estimated. This does not mean that people should keep smoking, of course. “The health benefits associated with quitting easily exceed the harms of extra weight,” the authors wrote. They also noted that weight could be kept down with healthy eating and physical activity.
