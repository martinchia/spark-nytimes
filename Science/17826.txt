How well you survive cardiac surgery may depend in part on your income. Previous studies have found an association between low socioeconomic status and higher risk for cardiac disease. Now Swedish researchers have studied the results of cardiac surgery in 100,543 patients followed for an average of seven years after surgery. They found that the higher a personâs income, the lower the risk of death. Compared with the one-fifth of patients with the lowest income, those in the next fifth had a 7 percent reduced risk for death, those in the third one-fifth a 13 percent reduced risk, in the fourth a 22 percent reduced risk. Those in the richest one-fifth were 29 percent less likely to die than those in the poorest group. The study is in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The authors acknowledge that they were unable to control for smoking, diet, physical activity and other factors. And it is possible that severe cardiac illness leads to lower income rather than the other way around. Still, they did control for many variables â sex, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, stroke and others. And the large sample gives the study strength. âWe have found a relationship between income and survival,â said the lead author, Dr. Ulrik Sartipy, a cardiac surgeon at the Karolinska University Hospital. âBut that doesnât mean that that there is a causal effect.â For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.
