 Screening young athletes with electrocardiograms to prevent sudden cardiac death may be ineffective, a new study has found. As it turns out, even pediatric cardiologists often fail to interpret the tests correctly. Researchers at Stanford University selected 18 EKGs, 8 from patients with normal hearts and 10 from patients with any of six different abnormalities that commonly underlie sudden cardiac death. The scientists showed the EKGs to 53 experienced pediatric cardiologists to see if they could make the correct diagnosis, properly restrict or allow athletic activity, and order appropriate follow-up tests. The correct diagnosis and recommendations were based on the report of two electrophysiologists, cardiologists who specialize in interpreting EKGs. The cardiologists correctly identified only 68 percent of truly abnormal cases — 32 percent of teenagers with abnormal EKGs were never detected. And of the cases the doctors did identify as abnormal, 30 percent were actually normal. “One of the most striking findings was the inability of the cardiologists to give correct sports guidance,” said Dr. Anne M. Dubin, an associate professor of pediatrics at Stanford and lead author of the new study. Twenty-six percent of patients who should have been allowed to exercise were not, and 19 percent of patients who should have been restricted were not, she noted. The report appeared online on Thursday in The Journal of Pediatrics. Dr. Dubin has received fellowship support from Medtronic Inc., a manufacturer of medical equipment.
