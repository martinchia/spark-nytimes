Readers asked Well about the preventative drug Truvada following a C.D.C. recommendation that all Americans at risk for H.I.V. take this daily pill that has been shown to prevent infection. New federal guidelines urge gay men and others who have unprotected sex to take a daily dose of the drug Truvada to curb H.I.V. infections and AIDS. Donald G. McNeil Jr. responds to reader questions. Asked by A Goldstein â¢ 1 vote If you could know exactly when you were about to be infected with syphilis or chlamydia, it would be a good idea to take antibiotics to prevent it, the same way that patients are usually given such drugs before surgery to prevent infection.  But we often donât know when someone weâre hot for is infecting us with a sexually transmitted disease. We may realize it only a week or two later, or much later. So for protection we would need to use the drugs all the time. Unfortunately, broad-spectrum antibiotics like penicillin and doxycycline kill all sorts of bacteria, including many good ones in our guts that we need to digest our food and fight off bad bacteria. That's why itâs generally not a good idea to stay on antibiotics for a long time. In fact, it can be quite dangerous because it raises your chances of being colonized by drug-resistant bacteria.  The drugs in Truvada, however, are quite specific to viruses, and to H.I.V. in particular.   Truvada does not protect against syphilis, gonorrhea or other sexually transmitted diseases. Condoms do â not perfectly, because they slip and break, especially during anal sex â but pretty well. Asked by Adam â¢ 1 vote No, you canât stop and start â not if youâre still having unprotected sex. You can miss a Truvada dose occasionally, but the more you miss, the greater your chances of getting infected.  According to a recent study,  men who took their Truvada pills every single day, seven days a week, were 99 percent protected â that is, virtually none got H.I.V. Men who took them four days a week were 96 percent protected. And even men who took them only two days a week were 76 percent protected. So thereâs some leeway if you miss your daily dose. But itâs Russian roulette, just as with birth control pills;  women can get away with missing them sometimes, but miss enough and they become pregnant. Reader Question â¢ 1 vote The price is high because of the way patents work in this country and because the pharmaceutical industry has  Congress in a headlock. As long as a company has the 20-year patent on a drug, it can charge whatever it wants. In this case, thatâs Gilead Sciences, which has the patent on the combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine that it calls Truvada — even though much of the development of those drugs was done with taxpayer and foundation money — until 2021. Yes, much much cheaper generic versions are made â by the Cipla company of India, for example, which supplies millions of doses to Africa. Yes, those drugs are safe. They have been approved by the World Health Organization. But no, you cannot buy them in the United States, because itâs illegal to import them.  Yes, you can probably buy them for less money in Canada or Mexico â as many Americans do with other drugs. But the pharmaceutical industry does not like this, and they do what they can to stop it. Good luck finding it more cheaply.  Right now, most health insurance companies and Medicaid do cover Truvada for the pre-exposure prophylaxis regimen, known as PrEP, though the co-payments can be very high. Gilead makes more than $3 billion a year on Truvada, and it has programs that help people with co-payments or give it free to those who are uninsured. How long they will keep that up is anybodyâs  guess. Reader Question â¢ 2 votes All drugs, including aspirin, have side effects. Truvada is considered a relatively low-side-effect drug, but no one has been on it for 20 years or more because it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration only in 2004. It also has a pretty clean record of not creating drug-resistant strains, especially compared with some other AIDS drugs. Rather than my going through a long laundry list of side effects, itâs best for readers to just use a search engine and type in âside effects of Truvada.â Common ones include headache and nausea, but those are typical of many drugs and usually go away.  Serious side effects include kidney and liver damage. Those are rare, but they are one of the reasons the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that everyone on PrEP should get his or her blood tested every three months. These blood tests can check for enzymes that indicate liver or kidney damage, for any other S.T.D.s that might have been picked up from not using condoms, and for the possibility of a breakthrough infection with H.I.V., which would mean being taken off PrEP and being put on the full three-drug regimen for people with the virus.
