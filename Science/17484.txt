 TEL AVIV — Moshira, a 9-year-old Bedouin girl with a rare genetic disease that left her in a vegetative state for most of her life, died on March 21, the same day she was profiled in an article in The New York Times. Bedouins do not carry more genetic mutations than the general population but they have many children with severe genetic diseases because of marriages between cousins. Moshira's father, Ismail, said his daughter was hospitalized after she experienced a high fever and had trouble breathing.
