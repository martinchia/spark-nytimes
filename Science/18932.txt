Asked by Nancy â¢ 1596 votes While a slightly elevated temperature may be a sign that you are getting sick, chances are a number of other factors are influencing your body temperature on a daily basis. As a result, 99.9 degrees Fahrenheit is not considered a fever. In 1868, the German physician Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich showed that normal human body temperature averages 98.6. But even then he knew that body temperature varied from person to person, at different times of day and for many other reasons besides illness. Body temperature tends to be about one degree higher during the day than in the middle of the night, said Matthew Kluger, a retired professor and expert in body temperature. âA higher temperature makes us run a bit faster, and I contend that it also revs up our immune response as well,â he said. Eating, exercise, ovulation and being on the pill can all drive up body temperature as much as a few degrees, as can emotional stress, according to a 2001 Japanese study. Age tends to drive down temperature, so an older person with a temperature of 99 might be getting sick, while a younger one with the same temperature could be perfectly healthy, said Jack A. Yanovski, chief of the Section on Growth and Obesity at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md. The method of measurement also matters, with a wider range of normal seen in oral thermometers compared with rectal or ear thermometers. Room temperature, whether youâve recently had something cold to drink, even whether youâre breathing mostly through your mouth, can also affect oral thermometer readings. Illness isnât just about having a particular reading on a thermometer, Dr. Yanovski said, but about having a spectrum of ailments, such as muscle or joint aches or diarrhea. A temperature above 100.4, regardless of the normal range for an individual, is considered a universal sign of fever and suggests an illness. If it is over 104, the person should seek medical attention. âThe higher the temperature, the greater the chance of a serious infection,â Dr. Yanovski said. Do you have a health question?
