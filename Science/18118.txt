 To the Editor: Re “Nurses Speak Out, About Doctors” (Books, Oct. 28): In her review of “Reflections on Doctors,” Dr. Abigail Zuger wonders, in writing on the changing nature of the relationship between nurses and doctors, “...if we are not first condemned to weather a Reconstruction-type era of confusion and ongoing mutual abuse, as all parties struggle to regain their footing.” Dr. Zuger’s offhand use of this troubled period deeply distressed both my moral and historical sense. Never could this new relationship between doctors and nurses be similar to that suffered by the South under Reconstruction, even ignoring the fact that the outcome of that era was Jim Crow, lynchings and the Ku Klux Klan.
