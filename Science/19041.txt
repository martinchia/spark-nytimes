Air quality has improved significantly in the past 20 years because of federal and state laws and regulations, and researchers in North Carolina have found an associated decline in rates of death from respiratory disease. A study, published Monday in The International Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, analyzed mortality trends for emphysema, asthma and pneumonia from 1993 to 2010, along with changes in air pollution levels as measured monthly. Sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide all decreased markedly month to month, and so did death rates from the three diseases. Reductions in sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide were associated with decreases in emphysema and pneumonia deaths, and reduced asthma mortality was associated with lower levels of sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and particulate matter. The associations persisted after controlling for smoking and seasonal variations in respiratory death rates, but the authors did not control for socioeconomic status or access to medical care. âWe still have things to work on,â said the lead author, Julia Kravchenko, a research scientist at Duke University Medical Center. âEven mild improvement in air quality will help reduce mortality from respiratory disease.â A version of this article appears in print on 06/24/2014, on page D4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Hazards: Lawsâ Effect on Lung Deaths.
