 The standard treatment for latent tuberculosis infection — that is, infection without symptoms — is nine months of daily doses of isoniazid, an antibiotic. The treatment is effective, but only about 60 percent of patients carry it out completely. Now the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that a regimen of 12 weekly doses of isoniazid along with another antibiotic, rifapentine, is just as effective, provided a health care worker supervises the administration of the medicine. The recommendation, based on results of three randomized clinical trials, appears in the Dec. 9 issue of the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The regimen is for patients 12 and older who are otherwise healthy. Children under 12 can be put on the three-month program in situations where the nine-month regimen is unlikely to be completed or when the danger of tuberculosis is great — for example, a recent infection in a preschooler. There are 11.2 million Americans with latent tuberculosis infection, according to Dr. Kenneth G. Castro, the director of the tuberculosis division of the C.D.C. “Within that 11 million, we target those at highest risk,” he said, including those who come from countries where TB is more common, people with diabetes and those on drugs that suppress the immune system. “If you have any of these underlying conditions,” he added, “you should get tested, and if positive, consider taking treatment under the advice of a physician.” A version of this article appears in print on December 20, 2011, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Regimens: A Much Quicker Way to Treat Latent TB.
