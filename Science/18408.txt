 Babies born prematurely face an increased risk of death in young adulthood, a new study has found, and the more premature the birth, the greater the risk. The study’s authors found that the increase in risk was independent of sex, birth order, maternal age and birth weight. The study, published Sept. 21 in The Journal of the American Medical Association, used Swedish birth records, which are nearly 100 percent complete. There were data for 674,820 births, of which 4.1 percent were preterm, defined as less than 37 weeks’ gestation. Researchers at Stanford followed the subjects from the 1970s until they were 29 to 36 years old. Even babies born late preterm — 34 to 36 weeks — had a 53 percent increased relative risk of death from ages 1 to 5 and a 31 percent increased risk after age 18, compared with full-term babies. But gestational age was not associated with more risk from age 6 to 17, perhaps because some fatal diseases take longer to grow. “Even though we found an increased relative risk, the absolute risks are less than 1 per 1,000 per year,” said the lead author, Dr. Casey Crump, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford. Preterm birth was associated with death before age 36 from congenital anomalies and from respiratory, heart and endocrine disorders, but not from neurological diseases, cancer or injury.
