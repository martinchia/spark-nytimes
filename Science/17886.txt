Every fall, Well celebrates Thanksgiving by focusing on the best part of the meal  — the vegetarian side dishes. But this year, we want to do something a little different. We’re looking for show-stopping vegetarian or vegan dishes that can hold their own at the center of the holiday table. We want dishes that make the meat-eaters take a second look — or better yet, skip the turkey altogether. We know our readers serve a lot of great vegetarian dishes at their Thanksgiving tables, and we want to hear from you. Last year Manhattan resident Diana Jarvis won us over with recipe for “Really Big Beets,” a ginormous roasted beet, cut like a steak, that wowed her crowd of both meat-eaters and vegans. Help us find the next great vegetarian main course. Send us your favorite vegetarian or vegan main dish by filling out the Well Vegetarian Thanksgiving Reader Recipe form below. Feel free to send us photos of the food, your family holiday or any picture that best illustrates your Vegetarian Thanksgiving story and don’t skimp on the details. We want to hear the story behind your fabulous vegetarian dish. We will pick our favorites and share them with everyone as part of our annual Vegetarian Thanksgiving event in November.
