Asked by Gloria â¢ 49 votes Yes, surviving Ebola appears to make you unable to catch it again, though this has never been formally tested, because it is unethical to deliberately try to reinfect someone with a fatal disease. But no one has been known to get Ebola twice, and survivors have high levels of protective antibodies in their blood. The immunity appears to be only against the same Ebola strain â in the case of the current outbreak in West Africa, the one called Ebola Zaire â although there may be some cross-protection against the four others. How long the immunity lasts is unknown. People who have developed immunity can be of great help in the outbreak. Their blood plasma is full of protective antibodies that can be injected into other victims â as long as they are a good donor match â and may save them by neutralizing what virus they have before it can enter more cells. (There is some risk of passing on other diseases like hepatitis or H.I.V., but those are treatable; Ebola is not.) Survivors can also bury bodies and provide care for the ill relatively safely. This could be valuable when personal protective gear hampers doing delicate tasks. For example, putting IV lines in childrenâs small veins is hard with three sets of gloves on. Care by survivors is part of a long medical tradition. In decades past, in smallpox epidemics in poor countries before vaccination was widespread, adults who had survived earlier epidemics isolated victims and cared for them. Scientists have long assumed that some people are naturally resistant to Ebola, because some have tended to and even buried relatives without falling ill. After a traditional healer in Sierra Leone died from Ebola, her body was so teeming with virus that it infected 14 mourners at her funeral. But another 26 did not get sick. Some might simply have been lucky, some may have had some sort of genetic protection. More important, there is evidence that some Africans do have genetic protection because they get infected but never develop symptoms. In 2000, a team of French scientists studied 24 people in Gabon who had tended to Ebola victims â mostly close relatives â without falling ill. Eleven had not just antibodies in their blood but remnants of virus and markers of inflammation, a clear indication that they had had the virus but had defeated it without ever falling ill. A similar 1999 study by American scientists in the Democratic Republic of Congo found similar results in five of 152 household contacts. If scientists knew which genes provided immunity, they could test for them. But they do not. They also have no idea how widespread that natural immunity is. The one large study that tried to establish that, published in 2010, was done by French scientists at the International Center for Medical Research in Franceville, Gabon. (From 1994 to 2002, Gabon had four relatively small, isolated Ebola outbreaks.) A team led by Dr. Eric M. Leroy, a virologist, took 4,349 blood samples in 220 villages selected at random â most of which had never had a case of Ebola. They found that 15 percent of Gabonâs population had at least some antibodies to Ebola. But it varied widely: Near the coast, only 3 percent did; in jungle villages near the Congo border, up to 34 percent did. Also, some of those people had low antibody levels. Exactly what level is protective is unknown. But if they had never met an Ebola victim, how did they develop antibodies? That also is unknown. One possibility is that they ate bushmeat â chimpanzee, monkey, or most probably, large fruit bats, which are a natural reservoir for the virus. They may have each gotten only a tiny dose of virus, small enough for their immune systems to fight off by developing antibodies. In effect, they were âvaccinatedâ by the meal. But Dr. Leroyâs leading theory was that they ate fruit that fruit bats had gnawed on and contaminated with their saliva. âWe imagine that this is the main route,â he said. âBut it is a hypothesis. We do not have the evidence.â Do you have a health question?
