 The most mysterious moment in a bubble’s life is when it pops and instantly loses its glorious form. Now researchers have used a high-speed camera to reveal what exactly happens when a hemispheric bubble, the kind that might sit on a soapy glass, bursts. A bubble may form a plethora of smaller bubbles when it pops, depending on its viscosity, or how thick and glutinous it is, according to a study published in the June 10 issue of the journal Nature. When a bubble bursts, its surface film folds back onto itself and traps a doughnut-shaped pocket of air, the researchers observed. Surface tension causes this ring to break, resulting in a set of small droplets — or daughter bubbles.

Bird, a post doctoral fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the lead author of the study. A soap bubble, which has a low viscosity, generates daughter bubbles. But a bubble made from molasses or chocolate syrup does not.
