 BANGKOK, Sept. 18   — Scientists combing through undersea fauna off Papua province in Indonesia said Monday that they had discovered dozens of new species, including a shark that walks on its fins and a shrimp that looks like a praying mantis. The team from Conservation International also warned that the area, known as Bird’s Head Seascape, is under danger from fishermen who use dynamite and cyanide. The group, based in the United States, called on Indonesia’s government to do more to protect it. “It’s one of the most stunningly beautiful landscapes and seascapes on the planet,” said Mark Erdmann, a senior adviser at the group who led two surveys of the area earlier this year. Mr. Erdmann and his team said they had discovered 52 new species, including 24 fish, 20 coral and 8 shrimp.

Dubbed Asia’s “Coral Triangle,” the area is home to more than 1,200 species of fish and nearly 600 species of reef-building coral, or 75 percent of the world’s known total.

Researchers announced in February that a survey of that area, in the Foja Mountains, discovered 20 frog species, including a microhylid frog less than a half-inch long; 4 butterfly species; and at least 5 new types of palms.
