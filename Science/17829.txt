âThere is no one who has not smiled at least once,â writes Marianne LaFrance, a Yale University psychology professor, in her 2011 book âLip Service: Smiles in Life, Death, Trust, Lies, Work, Memory, Sex and Politics.â Her book explores how smiling unifies us. Like breath, the smile is universal. We smile to connect, to forgive, to love. A smile is beauty, human. But I have never smiled. Not once.  I was born with Moebius syndrome â a rare form of facial paralysis that results from damage in the womb to the sixth and seventh cranial nerves, which control the muscles of the face. I was born in Britain, on the same day in 1982 the country’s first test-tube twins were born. But while science has created medical miracles like test-tube babies, thereâs little that doctors can do for someone with Moebius syndrome.  Decades later, I still cannot smile. Or frown. Or do any of the infinite subtle and not-so-subtle things with my face that I see others in the world around me doing every day. Doctors describe people with Moebius as having a âmask-like expression.â And that is what strangers must see. A frozen face, eyes unblinking. My mouth always open, motionless, the left corner of my lips slightly lower than the right. Walking down the street, I can feel the touch of casual observersâ eyes. A childâs very first âsocial smileâ usually occurs six to eight weeks after birth, eagerly awaited by new parents. Because, as an infant, my face remained so expressionless, when I began laughing it took my mother a while to realize that the sound I was making was laughter. At what point, I wonder, did I begin to compensate for the absence of my smile. I am constantly touching my own face, making it move with my hands. I like the sensation of my fingertips shifting my otherwise motionless lips. Itâs something Iâve done since I was very young. I remember, age 5, kneeling at my grandmotherâs dressing table, while my grandmother, without my noticing her, watched from around the doorjamb. Very quietly, I leaned toward her mirror, my elbows pressing into the cool granite top and, with two fingers, lifted the corners of my mouth into a tiny smile â a smile I only dared to share with my reflection. This was the beginning of my understanding that I was different. Not until I was 16 did Granny tell me that she had been watching me that day, saying, âIt broke my heart.â Through childhood and adolescence, I continued secretly âsmilingâ at myself in the mirror. Seeing the appearance, however awkward, of a smile on my own face helped me feel better about the day-to-day missed connections with others â schoolmates, girls in my ballet class, or adults on queue in the supermarket â who perhaps wanted to see me smile back at them. Not smiling is about much more than surface image, though. It takes real stamina. To swallow a mouthful of food, for example, I use a few delicately placed fingers to press my lips closed. After swallowing, I try to lower the helping hand so that it looks as though I am merely brushing a stray crumb from my mouth, hoping no one notices that I do this many, many times more than a normal person would. Going to sleep is another challenge. Because I canât voluntarily close my eyelids fully, I have to either hold my eyelids closed with my right forefinger and thumb until they stay shut, or lie on my back with a cotton tank top laid over my eyes in such a way that their lids are sealed. Sometimes this gets exhausting. Sometimes I shed tears, and that speeds up the process. I try to act around my disability. To pass. The one missing gesture I can never fully compensate for, though, is smiling. My body feels the smiles my face has never shown. When I explain to new friends why I donât â canât â smile, they say, Wow, that must be really hard. Not really, I lie, by now Iâm used to it. Still, there are moments when I feel the smile my face cannot physically make. It might be while Iâm laughing over a shared joke with a friend, or when a child passing on the street smiles up at me. It translates as instantaneous pleasure throughout my whole body â a kind of minute awakening, both within and without. For a long time I wondered whether it showed. But close friends tell me my smile does come through, that they can see my smile. Yet, recently, an elderly man passing me at a bus stop looked me up and down, caught my eye, and said, âPretty girls are supposed to smile.â I was speechless. I shook my head and laughed uncomfortably, hoping he wouldnât pursue the subject. As he walked away, I remembered a high school photographer cheerily calling âSmile!â just before the blinding white flash. âSmile,â someone says, and again Iâm 5 in the mirror, or 16, cringing, trying to do something I cannot do, and waiting for the uncomfortable moment to pass.
