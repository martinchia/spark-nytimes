 Baseball isn’t alone in having a steroid problem. The European beef industry has one, too — anabolic steroids have been outlawed there for two decades, yet they are still used to promote growth in cattle. (Steroids are not illegal in the United States and are used extensively by beef producers.) In Europe,   mandatory testing for steroid use in cattle is performed on a tiny fraction of animals because  it is costly and complicated, generally involving mass spectrometry and gas chromatogaphy to detect the steroids and their metabolites. But Rodat T. Cunningham of Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland and colleagues have now demonstrated the feasibility of a much simpler and cheaper approach to steroid testing in cattle. As described in the journal Analytical Chemistry, their technique applies statistical analysis to measurements of standard chemical blood markers associated with growth and muscle development, including total protein, cholesterol and bilirubin. In tests of cattle that received testosterone or estradiol versus controls, the researchers found that they could determine with an accuracy of 91 percent or higher which animals were getting the steroids. The researchers suggest that by allowing tests on a much higher number of animals, steroid abuse could be reduced. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page D3 of the National edition with the headline: Simpler, Cheaper Test For Illegal Steroids In European Cattle.
