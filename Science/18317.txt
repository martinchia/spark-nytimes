 Real men don’t ask for directions, and now researchers say the reluctance to ask for help may not just mean they get lost. It may also take a toll on their health. Men who strongly endorsed old-school notions of masculinity — believing the ideal man is the strong, silent type who does not complain about pain — were only half as likely as other men to seek preventive health care, like an annual physical, the study found. Even men with a high level of education, a factor that is strongly associated with better health and usually a predictor of longer life, were less likely to seek  preventive health care if they strongly adhered to the ideal of the macho man, said Kristen W. Springer, the study’s primary investigator and an assistant professor of sociology at Rutgers. “It’s ironic that the belief in the John Wayne, Sylvester Stallone archetype of masculinity — and the idea that real men don’t get sick and don’t need to see the doctor, and that real men aren’t vulnerable — is actually causing men to get sick,” Dr. Springer said. “These stereotypes and ideas are actually a reason why men do get sick.” The study may help explain the gender longevity gap, with women outliving men by about five years, Dr. Springer said. The findings, from a large longitudinal study of about 1,000 middle-age  men who graduated from Wisconsin high schools in 1957, were presented at a meeting of the American Sociological Association in San Francisco.
