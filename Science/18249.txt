 THE FACTS Many people have heard the curious claim that women who live together menstruate together. The idea dates at least to 1971, when Dr. Martha K. McClintock, an experimental psychologist, published a study showing that the menstrual cycles of women living in a college dormitory tended to synchronize over time. Dr. McClintock and other scientists suggested it might have something to do with pheromones,  chemicals that send messages by smell. Over the years, studies have added  weight to the findings, suggesting that it occurs in other animals, and proposed various evolutionary reasons for  it. But there is considerable debate over whether the phenomenon really exists, and many studies have produced findings suggesting it does not. Some scientists argue, for example, that synchrony cannot be possible because women often have cycles of different lengths. Other scientists who looked closer argued that many studies of the phenomenon — including the original one — suffered from statistical and methodological flaws. A study  published last year in the journal Human Nature  looked at 186 women living in dorms for a full year and found no evidence for synchrony. The authors also reviewed the original 1971 study and argued that its findings were due to chance. THE BOTTOM LINE The jury is still out on menstrual synchrony.  scitimes@nytimes.com  A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F5 of the New York edition with the headline: Menstrual cycles can synchronize over time.
