 To the Editor: In “When Battlefield Humor Backfires” (Cases, Aug. 24), Dr. Michael W. Kahn argues that caregivers can be much too quick to apply labels like “volatile, melodramatic, angry, manipulative, unpredictable” to their patients. I agree.

They happen to be wearing white coats and name tags to distinguish themselves from those on the other end of the stethoscope. Carol Jernigan, R.N. Memphis ♦ To the Editor: I remember an excellent teacher of Latin and Greek who was overweight. Behind her back, students called her “Mammoth.” At a parent-teacher meeting, a well-meaning parent greeted her as Ms. Mammoth. What’s said behind the back can come to the forefront!
