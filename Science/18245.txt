 Early humans were hunter-gatherers, but what did they gather? The easy stuff, archeologists say — roots, fruits and nuts. Until relatively late in the Pleistocene, which ended about 12,000 years ago, grains were thought to have been largely ignored by foraging humans, at least in part because they were difficult to process. But Julio Mercader, an archeologist at the University of Calgary, has now found evidence from a cave in Mozambique that humans were eating sorghum grasses at least 105,000 years ago. The evidence was in the form of microscopic starch granules found on stone tools from the cave. The limestone cave, in the highlands of northern Mozambique about 60 miles from Tanzania, has a long entry corridor that leads to chambers that are completely dark. “Humans were bringing in plants,” said Dr. Mercader, whose findings are published in Science. “Being so dark, you can’t argue that the plants were growing there naturally.” Dr. Mercader, who has been excavating the cave site for three years, examined 70 stone tools, including scrapers and grinders. Of more than 2,350 granules found, 89 percent were of sorghum. But he also found starches from nongrasses including the African false banana, which is actually a tuber, and the African wine palm, which has a trunk that is starchy and sweet. The addition of different food resources, Dr. Mercader said, shows that there was “economic complexity” in the behavior of these Middle Stone Age humans. A version of this article appears in print on December 22, 2009, on Page D3 of the National edition with the headline: Foraging Early Humans Did Not Pass Up Grains.
