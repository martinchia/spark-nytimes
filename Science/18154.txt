 To the Editor: “Redefining Disease, Genes and All” (May 6) tells us that Dr. Atull J. Butte of Stanford University needs only to sit at his desk and gather data on gene activity and then apply statistical analyses to map diseases based on similarity in their pattern of gene activity. Finding gene activity in a cell is not sufficient to link a gene to a disease. It is necessary to show how the gene is causally linked to the disease. Otherwise, drugs that affect the activity of the gene will not relieve disease symptoms. Time and precious research dollars will be wasted, and patients will bear the costs. Malcolm D.
