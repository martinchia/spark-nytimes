Reader Question â¢ 574 votes Essential tremor is involuntary shaking â usually of the hands, but sometimes also of the neck, jaw, voice or legs. âAny fine tasks with the hands can be very difficult when the tremor is pronounced,â said Dr. Albert Hung, center director of the Massachusetts General Hospital National Parkinson Foundation Center of Excellence.  Essential tremor can affect balance, walking, hearing and cognition, and can get worse over time, said Dr. Elan Louis, chief of the division of movement disorders at Yale School of Medicine. People with essential tremor run almost twice the risk of developing Alzheimerâs as the general population. Essential tremor appears with movement; if people let their hands sit still, they donât tremble. That is the big difference between an essential tremor and the tremor of Parkinsonâs disease, which can occur while at rest, Dr. Louis said. Essential tremor also tends to strike both hands while Parkinsonâs is more one-sided at first, said Dr. Hung. The cause of essential tremor remains a mystery, though it seems to run in families. People of any age or sex can have the condition, though it is more common as people grow older. Roughly 4 percent of 40-year-olds have essential tremor, compared with about 20 percent of 90-year-olds, Dr. Louis said. Available treatments âarenât great,â Dr. Louis said. Two medications â the beta blocker propranolol and the epilepsy drug primidone, sold under the brand name Mysoline â can reduce tremors by 10 to 30 percent, he said, but they work only in about half of patients. Deep brain stimulation â implanting electrodes into the brain to override faulty electrical signals â has been shown to markedly reduce hand tremor severity, he said. But the treatment can worsen cognitive and balance problems and âdoesnât cure the underlying disease. It merely and temporarily lessens a single symptom, which is the tremor.â  Do you have a health question?
