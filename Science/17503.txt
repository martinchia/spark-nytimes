 Researchers have found that different kinds of strokes are more likely to occur at different times of day, perhaps because of the body’s natural clock. Writing in The Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry, the researchers reported that three types of stroke all had two peak periods during the day: in the morning and in the evening. But the researchers, led by Dr. Shinichi Omama of Iwate Medical University in Japan, found that the peaks were not uniform. Occurrence of the most common type of stroke, for example, in which blood flow to the brain is cut off, peaked in the morning. Occurrence of the two other kinds, which involve bleeding in the brain or, more rarely, at its surface, peaked in the afternoon. The researchers reviewed first-time strokes among about 13,000 people from 1991 to 1996. Bleeding and clotting strokes have similar triggers, the researchers said, leading to questions about why the occurrence would vary with the hour of the day. Some research has shown that the blood is more prone to clotting in the morning, which may promote the second type of stroke and inhibit the first. The study also found that, over all, strokes are least likely to occur during sleep because blood pressure, a trigger, is lower then. Still, low blood pressure is also a trigger for clotting strokes.
