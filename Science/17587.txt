 To the Editor: Re “The Placebo Effect Finds an Unlikely Champion” (June 22): It is encouraging to read that Tor D. Wagner (and others) are working to establish the scientific bases for placebo effects routinely observed by clinicians. Among the many causes cited for this well-known effect, a significant factor is omitted: the relationship to the one offering the placebo. Since placebo is Latin for “I will please,” shouldn’t scientists also be investigating the role of the implied “whom” — the one who will be pleased? Bonnie E.
