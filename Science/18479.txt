 To the Editor: Re “Giving Women the Access Code” (April 3): The American Association of University Women’s 2010 research report “Why So Few? Women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics” details strategies to help attract and retain more women in these disciplines. They include actively recruiting students, broadening the scope of early coursework to include the wider applications of computer science and exposing students to successful female role models. Strategies like these worked at Harvey Mudd College and can work at other institutions that want to replicate its success. Dr. Maria Klawe should be applauded. Linda D. Hallman Washington The writer is executive director, American Association of University Women. ♦ To the Editor: Harvey Mudd has seen a commendable increase in the number of female computer scie nce majors. Yet students there already intend to major in science or engineering. Having more CS majors is important, but increasingly every field is using computing. We must continue to improve outreach to students across disciplines, exposing them to computing at a level appropriate for work they will do in jobs and graduate studies.
