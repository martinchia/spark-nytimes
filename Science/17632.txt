 The incidence of colorectal cancer is declining in the United States, but blacks are developing the disease and dying of it at higher rates than whites, and the racial gap is widening, the American Cancer Society has reported. In 1985, there were 66.3 cases of colon cancer per 100,000 people in the United States, according to the cancer society. By 1995, the figure was 54 per 100,000, and by 2005, the figure had dropped to 46.4 per 100,000. Until the 1980s, white men were more likely than black men to develop colorectal cancer, though rates for black women and white women were similar. But now the incidence of colon cancer is 22 percent higher among blacks.  And blacks are 43 percent more likely to die of the disease than whites, with a rate of 26.1 deaths per 100,000 blacks in the population, compared with 18.3 deaths per 100,000 whites. The colorectal cancer death rate for black men is particularly high, with 31.8 deaths per 100,000, compared to a death rate of 22.1 per 100,000 for white men, while the death rate for black women is 22.4 per 100,000, compared to 15.3 for white women.

Precancerous polyps can be detected through screening and removed before they become cancerous. Screening may also pick up existing cancers at an early stage, when treatment is most effective, she said.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Barely half of all people ages 50 and older are screened for colorectal cancer as recommended. But while some 45.8 percent of whites are screened, only 36.9 percent of blacks are screened, Dr. Ward said. Health insurance also plays a role: 45 percent of the insured get recommended screenings, compared with 13 percent of the uninsured, according to the cancer society. Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, affecting some 148,810 Americans this year and causing an estimated 49,960 deaths. Risk factors include obesity, a lack of physical activity and diets high in red meat and processed meats, Dr. Ward said. There is an association between diabetes and colorectal cancer, she added, but it is not well understood. People with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, a personal history of colorectal polyps or a family history of colorectal cancer are also at increased risk and should be diligent about being screened, Dr. Ward added.
