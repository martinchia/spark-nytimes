Gout, a form of arthritis, is extremely painful and associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular problems. But there is a bright side: It may be linked to a reduced risk for Alzheimerâs disease. Researchers compared 59,204 British men and women with gout to 238,805 without the ailment, with an average age of 65. Patients were matched for sex, B.M.I., smoking, alcohol consumption and other characteristics. The study, in The Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, followed the patients for five years. They found 309 cases of Alzheimerâs among those with gout and 1,942 among those without. Those with gout, whether they were being treated for the condition or not, had a 24 percent lower risk of Alzheimerâs disease. The reason for the connection is unclear. But gout is caused by excessive levels of uric acid in the blood, and previous studies have suggested that uric acid protects against oxidative stress. This may play a role in limiting neuron degeneration. âThis is a dilemma, because uric acid is thought to be bad, associated with heart disease and stroke,â said the senior author, Dr. Hyon K. Choi, a professor of medicine at Harvard. âThis is the first piece of data suggesting that uric acid isnât all bad. Maybe there is some benefit. It has to be confirmed in randomized trials, but thatâs the interesting twist in this story.â Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
