The benefits of breast milk are well known, and national health programs encourage mothers to nurse infants rather than feed them formula from bottles. But hospitals actually undermine efforts to encourage breast-feeding by including free formula in the care packages they give mothers and babies as they leave the hospital, according to a study last month in The American Journal of Public Health. Researchers surveyed about 3,900 Oregon women who had babies in 2000 and 2001. Among those who were breastf-eeding when they left the hospital, more than two-thirds said they had received hospital care packages containing formula.  But the care packages had a dramatic impact on patterns of breast-feeding. Women who received the packs were 39 percent more likely to stop exclusive breast-feeding at 10 weeks or sooner than those who didn’t receive free formula, according to the report.  “The distribution of these packs to new mothers at hospitals is part of a longstanding marketing campaign by infant formula manufacturers and implies hospital and staff endorsement of infant formula,” wrote the study authors. “Commercial hospital discharge pack distribution should be reconsidered in light of its negative impact on exclusive breast-feeding.” According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although about 74 percent of American women try breast-feeding, only 11 percent end up breast-feeding exclusively for at least six months.  Comments are no longer being accepted. Sounds like there ought to be a call for a “breast is best” speech to accompany these formula freebies. It’s true!  I was trying to breast feed and one day it got frustrating and sure enought I had a sample of formula from the hopsital.  That started the lessening of my supply and ultimatly the break down of my breast feeding plan.  It’s my fault for not sticking to 100% breast….but when I got frustrated I just used that free sample and that was that.  It was the beginning of the end. As a woman who received free samples after the birth of both of my children, I have to say that I doubt they had anything to do with when I stopped breast feeding.  The biggest reason I stopped was that I was back at work full time and, even though I have my own office with a door I can close and lock, pumping is a pain!  I lasted 8 months with each child and I am pretty sure I wouldn’t have gone longer had I not received any samples.  I haven’t read the study (though I might now), but I wonder if they did correlations with employment or, even better (and less likely), travel.  Having to take a business trip pushed me over the edge with my second child! Breast feeding as a first choice is best.  However, the Food & Drug Administration is on record as saying that Mother’s should breast feed OR use formula, but NOT cow’s milk. Unfortunately, this is another example of health authorities recommending that a nursing mother NOT use cow’s milk in the first six months WITHOUT telling the true reason. The “official” rationale is that breast-fed babies are healthier, have fewer hospital visits, fewer ear infections, etc.  That is all true.  However, the REAL reason that COW’s milk is NOT RECOMMENDED during the first six month’s of a baby’s life is that it significantly increases the risk of Type 1 diabetes.  The cause is thought to be due to the SIZE of the PROTEIN in cow’s milk, i.e., being larger than the protein in “mother’s milk”, it is more difficult for the baby to digest. Unfortunately, many people will “debate” this FACT, which is well SUPPORTED by significant amounts of research.  The first research, of which I am aware, was in 1989, when researchers in Finland determined this relationship.  They had a sincere interest because Finland has the highest rate of Type 1 diabetes (Juvenile Diabetes) in the world.  Instead of making consumers worry about the safety of milk, U.S. health authorities began to stress the benefits of breast feeding, with no comment regarding the risk of COW’s milk. This information is not presented for debate.  If a person prefers to ignore many years of research and give a newborn COW’s milk in the first six months and accept the risk of Type 1 diabetes, it is that person’s decision.  It should be noted that the researchers are not saying that milk creates a health risk for children and adults.  It states specifically that the risk is in the first six months of life.  Neither breast feeding or formula creates this risk. Have you ever looked at the label on baby formula and noticed that it always stresses words to the effect that “the protein in our formula is easy for baby to digest”. Although the official word regarding Type 1 diabetes is that “we know it’s an autoimmune disease, but we don’t know what causes it”.  For persons who are risk averse when it comes to their child, there is NO downside risk to the following hiearchy:  breast milk first, formula second, COW’s milk NEVER in the first SIX MONTHS. These facts should be known by new Mother’s because many women can’t take much time off from work and/or can’t breast feed at work.  Without the knowledge of the real risk of COW’s milk in the FIRST SIX months, a new mother may decide that cow’s milk is acceptable while she is at work. What is wrong with formula?  People act as though it is the devil’s brew.  Come on.  Not everyone can breast feed.  Moms are made to feel so guilty if they do not breast feed.  Most working women stop breast feeding because work makes it impossible to have any time to do it. My own daughter did not breast feed, she just wouldn’t latch on and cried all the time, so I  begrudgingly went to formula after several meetings with the “lactation coach.” My daughter is now 9, no behavior problems, has never been on an antibiotic in her life so far and is a happy, well adjusted child who excels in school.  I know many moms who breast fed their babies, only to feed them crappy processed food when they were old enough to eat.  Now those kids have many problems. Nutritional needs go way beyond breast feeding.   By the way, I never used the free samples. I’m not so sure about the conclusions of this study. The hospital offers the formula to all new mothers, but only the ones who don’t plan on breastfeeding exclusively decide to take it home with them. So that would explain why the woman who “received” the formula were more likely to stop at 10 weeks or sooner. I feel lucky to live in an Oregon town in which the norm is to breast feed if it is possible for the mom (it isn’t always possible), and it is common to see women breast feeding in the park, in restaurants and cafes, and at social gatherings.  I also feel lucky to have given birth in a hospital that had a full time lactation consultant on staff who worked with every single mom who chose to try breast feeding. I had a very difficult time nursing at first with my son. He just wouldn’t latch on. It was hard physically and emotionally and some nights he and I would both be in tears. I used a nipple shield for several months to give him something easier to latch to, and then we gradually were able to stop using that too. I had decided to breast feed unless it was impossible for some reason, and so I had the motivation to work hard. If I had been on the fence before this difficulty, I would have relied on the advice and council of the professionals at the hospital, and I would like to think that any woman in that position would be getting balanced and true
information, unbiased by formula corporation influence. I don’t judge women who make the decision to use formula. I know that many reasons, professional and biological, make it necessary for some women to make that choice.  If however, a woman is either for breast feeding or  neutral about it, the information and support to help her should be easy to access and the science behind Breast is Best should be readily shared. I breast fed my son for 2 years and 17 days. I know in some parts of the country that must seem like and incredibly long time. Some of my friends breast fed even longer, and some stopped much earlier. Each of us found the right time for our children, our selves and our family. Finally, breast feeding is like all other aspects of child raising – we must find the balance and do our best. I understand the temptation to use the formula given as part of a gift pack when you leave the hospital.  Up until my daughter was 12 weeks old, nursing was really hard.  Soreness, sleep deprivation, “mommy tendonitis” in the wrists, anxiety, etc.  Also, the lactation consultant said I might not be making enough milk for her when she was having a growth spurt.  But knowing that a can of formula was sitting in the pantry reassured me that she would not starve.  Encouragement & support from my husband was the biggest help (besides being convinced that I could do this and that I just needed to get over the hump).  The formula was my safety net.  I successfully nursed my daughter until she was 15 months old.  And we used the formula once to supplement.  And with my son, the formula was a huge help.  He was 5 days old and the pediatrician called at 9:00 p.m. to say his bilirubin level was high enough that we needed to take him to hospital ASAP.  She also told me that I had to stop nursing him because some form of jaundice could be exacerbated by breastmilk.  We were told to bring formula because it might take awhile to get checked in.  What to do at 9:00 at night?  We just packed up the formula we brought home and took him to the hospital.  Very convenient and it was one less thing to worry about that night.  We had to supplement with formula for him more, just because I couldn’t keep up the pumping with him.  My son is 21 months old and he’s still nursing, morning & night.  For me, the formula was a nice back up.  But support and education was what led me to successfully nurse my two.  And I agree with  poster No. 5, women should not be made to feel bad for formula feeding.  It’s such a sensitive issue. Well as an Adoptive Mom who left the hospital with her newborn son, I was quite happy for the free samples, and the extra ‘nursette’ bottles the staff loaded us up with.  Unlike biomoms, adoptive mom’s breastfeeding does not convey all the same immunity and other health benefits to the newborn/infant because they’re not our biological offspring.  :) …”If thereâs one consistent message on ensuring your childâs health from day one, itâs breastfeeding. Nurse your baby exclusively for at least 6 months. Donât be tricked by those freebie formula bags at the OB/GYNâs office. Theyâre there for marketing. Theyâre there to convince you itâs normal to feed your baby processed, powdered formula. Theyâre there to make you second-guess your decision to nurse. The most reputable doctors have stopped allowing sales reps to push formula onto their unsuspecting expecting mothers. Nursing isnât easy (What IS a football hold??). Nursing can be a nightmare. Nursing isnât for wimps. Of course all of the above can be said about âparentingâ in general. Doing whatâs best for your baby is what parenting is about…”  From the Forthcoming Book: “Obesity Action Hero” //www.actionagainstobesity.com
//www.MeMeRoth.net Formula freebies aren’t the only mixed messages new mothers get in the hospital. I was trying diligently to nurse my newborn daughter, only to find out that the nurses had given her formula in the middle of the night so that I could “get more sleep.” The next morning, the lactation consultant chastised ME for allowing it.  There is a lot more that could be done in hospitals to encourage new mothers to breastfeed. It needs to start with the baby nurses and lactation consultants respecting each others’ jobs and respecting the mothers’ wishes. Hospitals that are committed to encouraging breastfeeding ought not to offer formula samples unless mothers have expressed a need or desire to formula feed. (A less invasive way for formula companies to reach out to new moms would be through coupons — at least then the new moms would have to make the conscious decision to buy it.) But finally, for those new moms who can’t breastfeed, or can’t cope with breastfeeding, as much as possible should be done to make them comfortable with their decision.  After all, plenty of formula fed babies go to Harvard, too! How about 3 free visits from a lacation consultant to even the playing field? Breastfeeding is hard – a whole lot harder to stick with than feeding your baby formula. You will hit speed bumps and new moms need all the help they can get. As for the reader who said “what’s wrong with formula?” I guess you have a whole lot more confidence in the food scientists who create formula to mimic human milk than I do. Despite what I expect is a whole lot of research, I don’t think they know exactly what’s in it, nor do they put everything in formula exactly as it is in human milk. Of course, if you can’t breastfeed for some reason, it’s a fantastic option. But that is a long way from saying the two are interchangeable. I have happily breastfed three children for longer than twelve months.  The hospital did not offer freebies and – interestingly – has been criticized locally for being too gung-ho on breastfeeding what with midwives and lactation consultants running the halls… When boxes from Enfamil and Similac arrived in the mail at my house I took them directly to the nearest food pantry – PLEASE remember that food pantries love formula donations.  Anyway, at this point my youngest is a little too attached to breastfeeding… I am ready for her to be ready to be done… Anyone have tips on how to wean a 23-month-old girl who’s stubborn as a mule and strong as an ox? Oh well, hospitals and nursing. Horror stories from a midwife in training: Like the nurses giving formula to babies in the middle of the night even though the moms explicitly asked to be woken up. Sure thing the next day these babies were puking for hours. Or the lactation consultant that doesn’t allow any midwives in training to her sessions and nobody knows why so many moms decide to pump when they could still nurse in the hospital. I’ll stick to her advice and rather find a nice birthing house! I was given a sealed bag when I left the hospital, literally as I was leaving. Got home to find those ready to go formula bottles and cans of the powder. So I can’t say all women knew they were taking home formula so in some way planned to use it. Along with a 60 some page book from the formula company about how great breastfeeding is and how to supplement breastfeeding with formula or wean to formula. How a bottle of formula is a great time for Dad or Grandma to bond with the baby. I’m sorry but that’s far from harmless. I think formula, even today is presented by doctors and nurses as ‘the easy way out’ which is bad for both moms who want to keep nursing no matter what and those moms who formula feed. It diminishes the effort of the mothers who tough out all the problems of nursing, those who exclusively pump or pump for work and makes those moms who formula feed or even those who feed both formula and human milk seem lazy. When we in the US can give moms a reasonable amt of maternity leave, we can get rid of the formula samples, because moms will be able to continue breastfeeding at length. However, while we have a situation in which moms need to get back to work within a week or 2 weeks or 6 weeks after giving birth, we definitely need to help w/ formula samples. Sorry all you breastfeeding mavens–that’s just how it is. Formula samples in the closet don’t dictate the end of breastfeeding. Having to return to work does (for many people). The study’s findings correspond with my experience, particularly with my first child, now two years old, whom I breastfed for 15 months, exclusively for the first seven months. Breastfeeding is difficult to master and requires far more energy on the mother’s part than formula feeding, esp. during the baby’s first three months. Combine that with nurses who feed newborns formula, causing nipple confusion; milk that is slow to come in; and the common ailments of jaundice and yeast infections of the nipples — and women have a high likelihood of scrapping the breast for the bottle. When you’re desperately trying nipple shields, these small catheter-like tubes, and pumping day and night when you’re already exhausted to not only trick your crying baby out of nipple confusion, but also develop your milk supply, the numerous free formula samples, the free diaper bag, loads of marketing materials, and even free “DHA supplements” from Enfamil, legitimized by their reciept from my pediatrician’s office, were very tempting given this uphill battle. But once you introduce formula, it’s a quick downward spiral to the end of breastfeeding. Lactation consultants saved me. They openly contradicted the pediatrician’s recommendation to “just formula feed.” (I found a new pediatrician shortly thereafter.) There are 400 nutrients in breast milk that formula cannot replicate. Without consistent support from lactation consultants and your spouse, it’s no wonder only 11 percent of mothers continue to six months, even when the recommendation is to breastfeed for 12. (Note to previous respondent re: pumping: Yes, I agree, it is time consuming and highly disruptive to the work day. I began supplementing w/ formula at 7 months because pumping, even with the advanced Medlea pump, became too arduous for my work schedule and I yielded too little milk.) We have an infant and we also have a 5 year old.  While we basically “exclusively” breastfeed, we are grateful for the samples.  The wife works part time as an RN, about 3 days a week, and pumps.  Sometimes, however, when I am feeding our daughter the pumped milk, I run out before the baby is finished and I do not want to open another whole bag of pumped milk as she really only wants another 1/2 oz or so, so I make a small amount of formula for her. The freebie formula saves us money as we never end up buying formula since the freebies we got at the hospital and in the mail are enough for this small amount of “supplementation.” We did this with the 5 year old when he was a baby as well.  He nursed up to about 11.5 months when he gave up himself and just stopped doing it. I agree that breastfeeding is not necessary, but it is a nice thing to do for your child in terms of providing good nutrition, antibodies, etc. In my case my milk was late coming in and my child was jaundiced and the free samples did help immensely…BUT it was an effort to try to keep at breastfeeding because of it.  The nurses warned me that my daughter would become accustomed to not having to work very hard for her milk and that in turn would limit the stimulation I received from her so that my milk supply would never be enough.  So I got her off of the formula soon after she was better and breastfed her as often as she wanted.  I did persevere and my kid was just weaned at 3.5 years.  I wanted to stop at 12 months, but she wouldn’t let me. What is being missed here is that the Swiss company, Nestle, has its origin with formula.  Henri Nestle was a pharmacist who was very concerned about a newborn who was not properly breast feeding.  He created the first baby formula.  See the following for more information:
//www.teachspace.org/personal/research/nestle/history.html Formula was used for babies who would not nurse. I agree with the above posters that say that formula is not the devil that everyone says it is.  In my case, it was necessary for a preemie who would not latch and didn’t have the strength to keep trying.  For a stay-at-home mom with a full-term infant, of course breastfeeding is not only possible, but in many cases, necessary.  But for me, pumping was exhausting and debilitating.  I will always be proud that I was able to feed my son exclusively with my breastmilk for the first three months of his life.  But after that, I have been incredibly grateful for the modern technology that has allowed my to continue to feed my son (with formula) while bringing in over half of my family’s income, carrying the health insurance, and raising my child in the best way possible.   Were it not for formula, my husband and I would be mourning the loss of our son.  So don’t knock formula.  If you don’t have to use it, how wonderful, and more power to you.  But for those of us that need it, I’ll take every free sample (and coupon) that I can get.  And ultimately, it was MY choice to use the free hospital samples. I think that there should be two packs given by formula companies… one for breastfeeding moms, one for formula feeding moms.  The breastfeeding moms pack can include breast pads, lanisol, a booklet, and maybe a coupon for a breast pump or nursing bra.  The formula feeding mom kit can include all of the usual free formula stuff. The formula companies should be required to pay for the lactation consultant’s salary at the hospital if they want to give out their packs.  But no Mom should receive the formula pack prior to meeting with a lactation consultant.   Breastfeeding is easier. It’s cheaper. It’s better for babies.  Moms really need to know their options. Men, support your wives. Numerous studies have shown that breast *is* best. I thought I would lose my mind watching my wife struggle to nurse our tiny 5 lb. girl for the first week of her life. I thought our little one would never make it. Thanks to a wonderful lactation consultant, and my continued support, and the grace of God, the latch finally kicked in and our little one grew strong. Still smaller than the most others her age, but happy and brilliant, and *bonded* to her mom (and me). And don’t let your little ones drink fluoridated water. We can talk research till we’re blue in the face, but know this: even in mom’s who drink fluroidated water, breast milk has not a trace of it! Trust me, there’s a reason… nature always has a reason. Pharmaceutical marketers have their reasons too. Ignore the hype, take responsibility for your family! If you’re reading this you have internet access, so use it! I am a strong proponent of breastfeeding and nursed both my children.  My first was easy, or should I say as easy as it probably gets, as breastfeeding takes a huge commitment to get started, and an even bigger commitment to keep going if the mother and baby are to be seperated for any length of time.   Breastfeeding my second child was a nightmare.  She could not latch on properly.  The distress was significant for her, and the pain for myself made natural childbirth look like a cakewalk.  This lasted for months.  We were incredibly stubborn, and had great support, and made it through to the otherside.  Nursing eventually became an incredibly strong bond and nurturing experience between myself and this little person. Time, however, has not given me rose colored glasses about our early nursing experience.  I understand now why mothers are deluged in such a strong flood of bonding hormones.  It is so that they can still love those little wailing bundles of joy who are screaming for mom to eke out yet another dose of life’s sweet elixir through the raw bleeding nipples atop swollen throbbing breasts. At the depths of our nursing crisis, I could easily see how, given just a smidgen less help and support than I had, or a slightly lower tide of bonding hormones, or just a few more bad days piled into the same week, a woman might just break down entirely and leave her bundle of joy on the nearest church doorstep. I personally think that a handy sample can of formula might just be a better alternative.  What do you think??? Amen, fledermaus. I breastfed my firstborn, it was fantastic, I loved doing it. My second-born was not so easy; it turns out now that he had an anatomical issue in his mouth that prevented him from latching on. I also had mild postpartem depression, and I quit breastfeeding him after about a week. There are times I wish I had stuck with it, for his health and because I just enjoyed it so much with my daughter (and it also would have helped us discover his mouth problem earlier). But I also look back and think, I don’t think I could have done it any other way. For my needs at the time, to just get through those first weeks of sleeplessness and adjustment, I did what I had to do, which was to just pass on breastfeeding, since it was the most complicated factor in my life right then, and the only thing I could actually change.
