 Q. WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO TAKE ALL  THE ANTIBIOTICS THAT THE DOCTOR  PRESCRIBES, RATHER THAN STOP WHEN THE SYMPTOMS ARE GONE?  A. There are several reasons, said Dr. Carla Boutin-Foster, an associate professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, but a big one is to prevent antibiotic resistance. When bacteria become resistant to an antibiotic, they are able to survive and multiply. The altered bacteria may cause serious infections that can spread rapidly to others, Dr. Boutin-Foster said, so new, potent antibiotics must be sought. Failure may mean severe illness and even death. With some resistant bacteria, the illness can be so severe that it can be treated only at a hospital. An infection once treatable with oral antibiotics may require stronger drugs given intravenously. Stopping too soon or skipping doses is risky, Dr. Boutin-Foster said. The antibiotic may wipe out some of the bacteria but not all, and the remaining ones may cause reinfection or spread to other parts of the body. They may also affect the immune system, leading to conditions like rheumatic fever. Another concern is that if a patient who started to feel better suddenly begins to feel sick again, doctors may not know whether this is because antibiotics were halted or because a new infection was developing.
