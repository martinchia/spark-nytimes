 To the Editor: “Basking in a Workout’s Long, Mysterious Afterglow” (Personal Best, Dec. 21) describes a syndrome known as exertional hyperthermia, in which body temperature remains elevated for several hours after intense exercise. The condition is not necessarily benign. People who have experienced it may be susceptible to malignant hyperthermia, a similar, potentially fatal syndrome that can be touched off by certain anesthetic agents. The test for susceptibility, called CHC for caffeine-halothane contracture, is considered the gold standard. When patients with a history of exertional hyperthermia are facing surgery, they should be sure to inform the anesthesiologist. Hoshang J. Khambatta, M.D. Englewood, N.J.
