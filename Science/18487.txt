 To the Editor: Re “Dessert at Breakfast May Help Dieters” (Vital Signs, Feb. 21): The news about cake at breakfast and weight loss comes as no surprise to any mother who denies her child a cookie before dinner because it will spoil his appetite. Our M.I.T. research showed decades ago that carbohydrate intake increases serotonin and thus satiety, making dieter and nondieter alike less hungry for the subsequent meal. But surely more nutritious carbohydrates than cake could be chosen as an appetite suppressant. Judith J.
