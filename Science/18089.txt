 To the Editor: Re “10 Things to Scratch From Your Worry List” (Findings, July 29): I found John Tierney’s list of things not to worry about to be a real bummer. Playing the lesser-of-two-evils card, he blithely suggests vacationers not agonize about using plastic shopping bags because they cause less ecological damage than paper. I have a better suggestion for Americans seeking a guilt-free August. Do what hundreds of millions of shoppers around the world already do — bring your own reusable bag. No waste. No worries. Matthew KingSanta Monica, Calif.  To the Editor: John Tierney’s “10 Things to Scratch From Your Worry List” (Findings, July 29) is irresponsible in its incompleteness. He speaks of evidence that plastic bags have less of an environmental impact than paper bags. In doing so, he is telling your readership not to worry about using plastic bags. Why not talk about choosing products with less packaging — paper or plastic — and filling your own reusable containers in the bulk food section? Reusable bags made from natural fibers or recycled/recyclable materials can be used for many years. Advertisement Before scratching something from our worry list, we should be well informed. I’m more worried now than before reading Mr. Tierney’s article.  Jim O’Neil Advertisement Portland, Ore.  To the Editor: I was shocked to read the nominally cute article by John Tierney. In an effort to be more entertaining than scientifically responsible, he has obfuscated an ongoing important effort to educate citizens of the impending dangers of permanently soiling our planet and warming it dangerously and irreversibly. A casual reader could likely take away some lessons that are very wrong.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

To wit: routine overuse of air conditioning is not a problem; continuing to use plastic bags and throwing them in landfills is just fine; and melting artic ice is not a problem. Following these guidelines would certainly make our lives a little easier, but perpetuate dangerous current practices. I reject the thought that Tierney has made a Faustian pact with some elements of the industrial complex leading to this article.  Joseph Casanova Long Beach, Calif.  To the Editor: Is John Tierney actually giving a thumbs up to low-carbohydrate diets by touting one recent “rigorous” study showing “better” weight loss results? Having an occasional high fat frank while on vacation or otherwise is nothing to worry about; however, “low-carbohydrate, unrestricted-calorie diets” are a source of worry — no matter what the lipid profile indicates — because when the diet is over (and a plethora of research shows that four months of compliance is about the limit), the weight loss and lipid profile results are temporary. If I were John Tierny, I’d worry about not facing the same demise as Dr. Adkins, and if I were you, consider having that occasional high fat frank on a whole wheat bun. Marcy S.
