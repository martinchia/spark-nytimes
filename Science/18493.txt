 A giant crocodile with a bulging shield of thickened skin on its forehead lived among dinosaurs, a new study reports. The reptile, which researchers are calling Shieldcroc, lived about 95 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period. A partial specimen suggests its skull was five feet long, said Casey M. Holliday, a paleontologist at the University of Missouri who led the study. “An animal with a head that big,” he said, “is looking at a body 25 to 35 feet.” Today’s crocodiles are much smaller, seldom exceeding 20 feet.

The findings, by Dr. Holliday and Nick Gardner, an undergraduate at Marshall University, in Huntington, W. Va., are reported in the journal PLoS One.

Shieldcroc is the earliest African ancestor of the modern crocodile, Dr. Holliday said. During the Cretaceous, many more species of crocodiles existed than do today, he said, adding that discovering ancient species may help explain why some went extinct while others survived. “We’re finding that not only were crocodiles living in the water, but they were living on land and not only chasing animals, but also eating plants,” Dr. Holliday said. “Crocodiles were operating a whole suite of niches that they don’t know today.” A version of this article appears in print on February 7, 2012, on Page D3 of the New York edition with the headline: A Giant Crocodile Roamed With Dinosaurs.
