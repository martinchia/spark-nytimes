 In an 1853 letter, the glass sculptor Leopold Blaschka described the first time he was mesmerized by what is known today as bioluminescence. The letter was translated from Old German by Henri Reiling, a scholar at Utrecht University in the Netherlands: “We are on a sailing ship in the Atlantic Ocean, immobilized because of the calm; it is a beautiful night in May. Hopefully we look over the darkness of the sea, which is as smooth as a mirror: In various places there emerges all around a flashlike bundle of light beams, like thousands of sparks, that form true bundles of fire and of other bright lighting spots, as if they are surrounded by mirrored stars. Diving into today’s oceans, one scientist looks for modern day mirrors to sea creatures frozen in glass in the late 1800s. “There emerges close before us a small spot in a sharp-greenish light, which becomes ever larger and larger and finally forms a bright, shining sunlike figure. Its fine second one develops, a third; ten, a hundred of these suns light up at a certain distance from the peculiarly sparkling intervals, bright lighting circles form strangely formed figures, with in-between places in a glowing light. An indescribably beautiful scene originates... it is as if they wanted to lure the enchanted observer into a realm of fairies.” A version of this brief appears in print on May 7, 2013, on Page D7 of the New York edition with the headline: Glimpses of ‘a Realm of Fairies’.
