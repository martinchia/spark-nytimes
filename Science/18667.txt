When we talk about compassion in medicine, most of the focus is on doctors. But what about nurses? I asked Theresa Brown, a nurse and writer, to share her experiences caring for — and caring about — her patients. In medical oncology our patients stay in the hospital often for weeks or even months. They leave and come back, again and again, with this or that complication, or because they need more chemo, or because theyâve relapsed. We get to know them, their families, even their friends. And because we know them so well, in such an intense and intimate setting, we end up caring about them.  Recently I was assigned to a patient I had gotten to know well, a guy in his fifties whoâd lived and worked in the same small town in rural Pennsylvania for years. I had been his nurse off and on since his initial diagnosis the previous spring, and had cared for him more recently after an allogeneic stem cell transplant. But now he was deteriorating. His abdomen was bloated, due to a problem with his liver, and he also had a huge blood clot in the vein where his permanent IV line was placed. For two days he had been saying, âI feel terrible,â a non-specific complaint that is scary and ominous.  âIf he dies I donât know what Iâm going to do,â I confided to the dayshift nurse. She looked at me, then looked down at her papers and nodded. This is what it means to be a nurse in oncology, a no-win situation where compassion routinely gets hijacked by grief. On TV or in the movies, dying patients are usually tended to by physicians. But if you die in a hospital, the person caring for you in your last days, hours, and minutes will be a nurse. The doctors care, too, of course, and check in and write orders, but weâre the ones who are always there. We watch over the patients as they struggle against their disease, and weâre there, too, if they decline, beginning their slow embrace with death. When I did my initial assessment of the patient that afternoon, something just seemed off. I asked him to follow my finger with his eyes and to push up and down against my hands while I pushed back. These are basic tests of neurological function and his grip was good, but his ability to push down was almost nonexistent. I asked him again to follow my finger.  âHeâs not doing it, is he?â asked his wife.  âNo, heâs not,â I said.  She had remained calm and kind throughout his many hospitalizations, but I could hear the worry in her voice. I called the doctor. She was leaving the hospital for the day when she got my page, but she came back and examined the patient. His ammonia levels were rising due to his failing liver, something that can cause âmental status changes.â  He was getting large doses of heparin, a blood thinner, because of his clot. Could the heparin have caused a bleed inside his head? The doctor’s exam, like mine, showed some deterioration in neurological function. She ordered a CT of the patientâs head and she prescribed a treatment to bring down his ammonia levels. The next time I went into his room, I bent over him to give him a shot. When I finished he grabbed my hands. His grip was strong, and for those few seconds at least, he was completely lucid.  âSo am I gonna live or am I gonna die?â he asked me. âI donât know,â I told him, turning away to put the used syringe in the sharps container. My voice seemed small and tinny. âI wish I could look in a crystal ball and find out, but I canât,â I said, forcing myself to turn back around and look at him. Why did this patient matter so much to me? This was the patient who thought I looked like a âPhyllisâ more than a Theresa, so âPhyllisâ became a joke between him, his wife, and me. One of the first days he was in my care, when he still looked healthy and felt pretty robust, he told me a hilarious story, supposedly true, but unprintable in a family newspaper, about infidelity, obesity, and why itâs good to have a cellphone handy if youâre trysting in the backseat of a car. The first time he spiked a temperature I called the intern in a panic. âHeâs got a fever!â I said, as if it was the first fever in the history of the world. Later I apologized to her, but she understood. Now, though, he was struggling. I had several days off following that shift and I called work on my third day at home to ask about him. âC.M.O.,â our secretary told me, and I swore into the phone. C.M.O. means âcomfort measures onlyâ: they were withdrawing care. He had a cerebral bleed; heâd âseizedâ the night before and was now in the Neuro I.C.U. Without even thinking about it I decided to go to the hospital where I knew his family would be gathered. The lounge to the N.I.C.U. was filled with his family members, all sad, some crying. I saw his wife, who hugged me. She asked me if I wanted to see him, but I said no, since he wouldnât have known me. Instead, we talked about the two of them, about trying to pick up her life, about making sure that he wasnât suffering. When I left she said the same thing she had said to me the last night her husband was my patient: âI love you.â  He died later that day. It hurts even now. A nurse on my floor said, âYou girls get too attached,â and sheâs right, of course.  Comments are no longer being accepted. I am very grateful there are nurses like you around.  Not everyone can be cured, but everyone can be cared for and  comforted, and nurses who not only have professional competence but also can squeeze a hand and offer kindness make a big difference to suffering patients and their families.  Thank you, a million times over. God bless you, Theresa. Should I ever become similarly ill I’d want you to be my nurse. While the question might be rhetorical, the answer is no. I’m sure there is some example of a nurse caring too much and being too attached, but this isn’t it.  Theresa, I believe your behavior was pitch-perfect for you and for that family. Compassion is positive, I think–I certainly enjoyed more of it from nurses than doctors when hospitalized–but did you have other patients? I guess the secret is to pace yourself–hard, I know. I’m touched by this mostly because you describe compassion very concretely ; as an individual and as a family member, I hope that when I’m affected by serious disease that my institutional caregivers show compassion.  As a nurse, too, I totally relate and it does raise the question, “how long can professional caregivers feel and show compassion before it starts to burn you out?”  and, “is that level of demonstrated compassion essential to good care?”  I don’t know the answers.  Thanks. I think what you do requires such deftness– walking that high wire of professional care and emotional attachment. It seems to me that you are a wonderful nurse, Theresa, as you display yourself fully as a human being.
I see attachment as another skill set and I commend you for it. This piece was touching and poignant. Thank you Ms. Brown for sharing. I’m going for my nursing degree and I’ve been thinking if I’ll be a good nurse and just reading your article reafirm my friends’s comments that I will be a great nurse.
I love to help people specially when they are sick or just need someone to show that someone cares.
Thanks for the article, I enjoyed it. It isn’t possible to describe the gratitude my husband and I had, and continue to have 16 years later, for the compassionate nurses who cared for our 8 year old daughter as she was dying.  The lovely nurse who silently wept as she extubated our daughter gave us more comfort than she ever knew, because in that intimate moment, she was courageous enough to join us in our grief.  Thank you Theresa, the gift you gave that family will never be forgotten. It’s really hard, and really sad to see this year after year, but in the end, I never regret that I cried along side patients and families.  This is why we chose to be nurses. with tears in my eyes — how lucky they were to have you. Geoff- She probably needs someone to take care of her… Theresa, it seems like you are good and very compassionate nurse. I wish all nurses are like you! Can nurses really care too much? But you are also human being, who has feelings, who get emotionally attached to patients. I would love to see more of you on the floor! I don’t think it applies in this case, but it is certainly possible for a nurse to care too much. There is an excellent book, about 30 years old, titled , “The Long Dying of Baby Andrew” by a couple named Stinson. A word of prefatory explanation: The Stinsons’ son was born too premature to save and they chose palliative care. Unfortunately, Andrew fell into the hands of a large teaching hospital where the physicians had never seen such a tiny preemie survive this long before, and became intrigued by the question of how long they could keep him going. By the end of this horror tale, when Andrew mercifully reached the inevitable end, every bone in his body had been broken at least once in the course of his “care,” and the doctors’ notes – which the family had to pry out of the hospital’s grip – indicated that Andrew stopped screaming in pain only when he was too exhausted to cry. The nurses made this bad situation worse. When the parents came to the NICU, they found it decorated with toys, etc., and the nurses told them all kinds of things that “Andy” (the parents hated that nickname) had supposedly done, smiling, reaching for and playing with toys, etc. (which he obviously had not done). Whether their motives were to comfort the parents, or themselves, with these lies, or whether they were sincerely deluded into the belief that Andrew was better than he was, they exacerbated the tragedy with their cluelessness, and doubly exacerbated it by their hostility to the “cold,” “uncaring” parents who didn’t buy into it. Interestingly, the authors are compassionate toward the nurses who were over-invested in the baby. Perhaps this was the only way they could handle the emotions from dealing every day with damaged and dying babies. Anyone who spends as much time, attention, energy, and commitment as a nurse does, as you did with this gentleman, and does not get emotionally involved to a degree shouldn’t be a nurse.
Beverly A Cawley, RN I recently went through lots of chemo, and seven weeks in a hospital getting a stem cell transplant……all I can say, Theresa, is; don’t ever change…… As a student nurse doing a rotation in pediatrics this idea came up in the form of a warning from a fellow student; ” For your sake don’t become  attached to your patients.”  A wise intern overheard that and said, “If you don’t become attached you’re in the wrong profession.”  It is painful to lose someone you care about but it is a gift to the patient and the family for them to know this person is valued and will be missed by you.  That human connection is what it’s all about, isn’t it. RN/PhD As a former (retired now) Oncology nurse and Hospice nurse, I have to say “too attached” is a misnomer.  Each individual with whom we develop a connection becomes a forever part of our lives, and as caring individuals, we learn about life by growing through experiences shared.  All of us (patient, families, staff caregivers) can gain through the incredible insights available to us, as we walk with each other from diagnosis through (and beyond) the inevitable. We learn about human strength, weakness, the gamut of emotional scope, and too, we learn about ourselves (if we allow ourselves to be mindful of what we are feeling each moment). We learn about sensitivity, seeing, listening, feeling, and what empathy is all about.  I’d not trade the years of those attachments for anything in the world. And if the words must be “too attached” I’ll have to have them imprinted on a flag and threaded onto my cane, fly it high, all the way to my own “inevitable” where I have been taught by those who’ve preceded me, “It’s what you are inside your heart that will carry you through. Wave that flag!” If you need care, call a nurse, not a doctor. And this is not meant as an insult to doctors. Several years ago I spent 30 consecutive days on an oncology ward in a hospital in No. Cal. I was there to shoot a documentary about the day-to-day life as a nurse. It was intended for new nursing students. In 30 years of filmmaking I have never worked so hard, never saw so much heartache and raw nerves. as I did that month. The good nurses could not, not care. These people were so dedicated to their patients and families. They tried, but only occasionally succeeded at keeping their emotions in check. And it exhausted them. And to this day I show nothing but respect…and care…for a nurse. I’ve had great doctors these last few years as a cancer patient and most of my doctors have become personal friends, as well…..but I must say, when I’m a patient, its the nurses who are the ones that can explain what’s happening, why it’s important that they do a procedure, and who stick around to give me a hug or hold my hand or comfort me when I’m scared or nervous. I LOVE NURSES….they are the BEST….and don’t get enough credit for all the good work they do…..kind of like teachers….. I am a nursing student and appreciate reading about an experienced nurse’s feelings and experiences.  Thank you. I can totally relate.  I worked in neurosurgery for 15 years, and the patients with brain cancers would be readmitted frequently over the course of the remainder of their lives, usually a year or two or three.  Going to work was like going home, to a second family.  We nurses would call on our days off to see how patients nearing the end were faring.  We  wanted to see them again, once more, before the end, and often came in on our days off to say goodbye.  We went to wakes and funerals.    Their families became close to us; we shared so much with them — life stripped bare except for its deep essentials — love, regret, caring, comfort, death.  I was lucky to work with a wonderfully dedicated team of nurses who gave excellent and diligent care.  We didn’t consider ourselves as caring too much, or over-involved with our patients and their families.  Theresa, we are but human, and I think you did exactly right. I agree this is a caring nurse.
At this point  in her story( quoted below), should she have considered a different response, perhaps acknowledging the patient’s realization that his death was near?
“His grip was strong, and for those few seconds at least, he was completely lucid. âSo am I gonna live or am I gonna die?â he asked me.   âI donât know,â I told him, turning away to put the used syringe in the sharps container. My voice seemed small and tinny. âI wish I could look in a crystal ball and find out, but I canât,â I said, forcing myself to turn back around and look at him.
The patient was giving the nurse  the opportunity to divulge the truth, indeed asking the nurse for the truth,and the hopelessness of his situation. It is often difficult to be truthful, but being truthful is the ethical approach.
I think the failure to be truthful with the patient may make  the emotional strain that much harder. Thank you for sharing your point of view. My sister is fighting ALL (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia) and it’s been a difficult 2 years for the family. She’s gone through extensive chemo and a bone marrow transplant. Yet, the cancer has come back most recently. Luckily, she has a wonderful team of nurses and doctors that care for her. And, in this trying time, it’s the little things that are seeing her through–the nurses’ smiles, warm hugs, jokes, and sincere compassion for her and the other patients. Nurses and al healthcare workers need to rise above the emotional forest and understand their work.  That does not mean they need to be cold hearted and incompassionate providers.  It will make them better providers in all ways. In this instance the nurse laments when the patient went into comfort measures only.  That is hospice nursing and it is just as compassionate if not more so than curative measures.  Instead of cursing the move a good nurse recognizes the need, embraces its purpose and even recommends its institution.   Dying is part and parcel to living.  It is quite predominate in all areas of healthcare.  We work to stave it off and we love the work and all of our patients.  I can say goodbye and be happy that we did the best to cure and the best to provide comfort, the best overall approach and comprehensive care.   I save my emotions for industries like tobacco whose sole purpose it is to addict people caring not one whit about their health. Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
