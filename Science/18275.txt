 It’s a familiar scene following a major oil spill: struggling seabirds, doomed from the thick coat of oil on their plumage. They are a very visible indicator of how catastrophic a spill can be. But Cristóbal Pérez of the University of Vigo in Spain and colleagues suggest that seabirds who survive a spill may be useful in another way: they could help track the spread of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from the event. PAHs, as they are known, are toxic contaminants from oil spills, ship discharges and drilling activities that pose health risks to marine creatures (and humans as well). PAHs can be monitored by analyzing the tissues of seabirds or other animals, but the approach is considered unreliable because most animals metabolize PAHs fairly rapidly. And to get tissue for analysis, the animal usually has to be dead. The Spanish researchers report in Environmental Science and Technology that they have successfully measured PAH levels in blood from yellow-legged gulls to monitor the spread of contaminants from an oil spill off Spain in 2002. That spill, from the tanker Prestige, released about 60,000 metric tons of fuel oil, fouling long stretches of the Spanish and French coasts. Blood cells are continuously produced and have a life span of only a couple of weeks. So their PAH levels should be a relatively accurate measure of recent exposure to the hydrocarbons. And taking blood samples from the birds can be relatively quick and easy and causes no harm to the birds.
