 Q. Is there evidence that Kegel exercises really strengthen bladder control? A. Several studies have found that Kegel exercises, in which the muscles that cut off urinary flow are tensed and then relaxed, can help many people control stress-related urinary incontinence, if the exercises are properly done. In some studies, surgery was found to be more effective, but it has risks not associated with exercise. In stress incontinence, pelvic floor muscles that support the bladder are weak and the sphincter muscles around the urethra are not strong enough to prevent leakage during movement. A simple Kegel exercise involves cutting off urine flow for six seconds and resuming urination for six seconds. Urologists recommend doing several cycles several times daily. In a study published in the journal Gerontology, half of a group of incontinent women in a nursing home were treated with both exercises and bladder training, to increase the interval between urinations. “A significant increase in pelvic floor strength was observed in the treatment group compared to the control group,” with improvement in symptoms, the study reported.  Kegel exercises have also been used effectively by men and children. In other studies, Kegel success rates were higher with supervision and biofeedback, and a studyfound that when exercise treatment was initially successful, there was a 66 percent chance that the results would last for 10 years.
