 The California sea lion is a robust species, but in the past decade marine biologists have recognized domoic acid poisoning as a growing threat to its health. In large enough doses, the acid, a neurotoxin, can cause disorientation, seizures, brain lesions and, eventually, death in the animals (and in humans, for that matter). Domoic acid, naturally produced by certain algae, is a problem when algal blooms produce enough of it that it accumulates significantly in the food chain and the sea lions consume contaminated prey. Algal blooms have been increasing in the sea lions’ habitat, coastal waters off California and northward, resulting in more cases of acute poisoning. The blooms also result in more long-term exposure to lower levels of the toxin, and researchers who have studied sickened sea lions say although the levels are not lethal, they cause chronic health problems. Tracey Goldstein of the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, Calif., which rescues and studies sick animals, and colleagues report in The Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences that these long-term effects — essentially, epilepsy — can now be recognized as a second neurological syndrome. They add that the chronic conditions are also being seen in juveniles, suggesting that exposure to the toxin in the womb and through nursing may also be a problem.
