 Women whose  weight gain during pregnancy meets  the  current recommendations  are significantly more likely to have a 3-year-old who is overweight than those who gain less than the recommended amount, researchers report. Guidelines from the Institute of Medicine say that a woman with a normal body-mass index of 19.8 to 26 should gain 25 to 35 pounds. Women with a lower than normal B.M.I. should gain slightly more, and those with a B.M.I. greater than  26 should gain  13  to 25 pounds. Researchers studied 1,044 mother-child pairs. After controlling for prepregnancy  B.M.I. and  other factors, they found that women whose  weight gain was in the  recommended range were almost four times more  likely to have a preschooler who was overweight as those who gained less. The 3-year-old children of mothers who gained more than  recommended   were also more likely to have higher systolic blood pressure. The study is in the April issue of The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. A majority of mothers in the study gained more weight than is recommended, but gaining less than the recommended amount was not associated with  any negative outcome. “The guidelines should probably be re-evaluated,” said Dr. Emily Oken, the lead author of the study. But, she added, “It’s a little too early to recommend gains less than the current guidelines indicate.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F7 of the New York edition with the headline: Findings Challenge Guidelines For Weight Gain in Pregnancy.
