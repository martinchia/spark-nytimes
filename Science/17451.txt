 For decades, experts have debated why children raised on breast milk tend to score higher on I.Q. tests. Was it something in the milk? Now, researchers have found that at least part of the answer may lie in a gene. Breast-fed children with one common variation of the gene scored an average of seven points higher on I.Q. tests than children nourished on formula or cow’s milk; but children with another, less common variation did not benefit from breast-feeding at all, the researchers reported yesterday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “This is not specifically a breast-feeding gene but a gene that influences how we process nutrients,” said Avshalom Caspi of King’s College London and Duke, who led the study. Researchers from Yale and the University of Otago in New Zealand were also involved. The scientists analyzed genetic samples from 3,200 children in New Zealand and England whom they had been tracking since infancy. They focused on a gene involved in the metabolism of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which are abundant in breast milk but not in cow’s milk or most formulas. One variation of the gene, found in some 90 percent of people, helps the body metabolize the fatty acids more efficiently than the other variation does — and accounted for all the advantage associated with breast milk. The relationship held regardless of family income or parents’ I.Q. “The big message from this,” Dr. Caspi said, “is that it’s not nature versus nurture that’s most important, but how nature works through nurture.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F6 of the New York edition with the headline: Gene Found to Play Role In Benefits of Breast Milk.
