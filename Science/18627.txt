There are as many kinds of stews as there are cooks, blending meats, seafood, vegetables and spices into a hearty and flavorful melange. This week, the Recipes for Health columnist, Martha Rose Shulman, turns her attention to chicken stews: I wanted each of these stews to feature a nutritious vegetable along with the chicken and aromatics. In this way they are truly one-dish, nutrient-dense meals. Though I suggest serving them with rice, other grains or pasta, if carbs are an issue, know that these stews are very satisfying on their own. Here are five new recipes for making chicken stew. Greek Chicken Stew With Cauliflower and Olives: Cinnamon adds a subtle sweetness to this stew. If salt is an issue, omit the olives; the stew will still be delicious. Chicken Stew With Sweet Potatoes, Almonds and Apricots: Loosely based on an Algerian recipe from âReal Stewâ by Clifford A. Wright, this sweetly spiced dish, with beta-carotene-rich apricots and sweet potatoes, is also evocative of recipes from the Middle East and Iran. Chicken Cacciatore With Mushrooms, Tomatoes and Wine: This version of the classic Italian dish includes lots of mushrooms, both dried and fresh; you can add kale if you want to work in some leafy greens. Chicken and Pepper Stew: This is an adaptation of a classic French bistro dish, poulet Basquaise. Veracruzana Chicken Stew With Winter Squash: This dish is loosely based on a chicken stew from the Mexican state of Veracruz, where Spanish influences still remain strong.
