PhotoCredit  Got seven minutes? We’ve got the app. Today The New York Times is offering a free mobile app for the popular Scientific 7-Minute Workout and the new Advanced 7-Minute Workout.  The workouts, reported by Gretchen Reynolds, our Phys Ed columnist, can now be installed on your smartphone or tablet, or used on your desktop computer. The app offers a step-by-step guide to both 7-minute workouts, offering animated illustrations of the exercises, as well as a timer and audio cues to help you get the most out of your seven minutes.  In the coming months, we’ll offer additional Well fitness apps to give you a full library of workout options using your smartphone, tablet or computer as a personal fitness guide. If you have suggestions or feedback about the new apps, feel free to post a comment below. iPhone and iPad app users can leave comments here.
