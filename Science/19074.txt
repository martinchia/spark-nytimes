There are so many fall vegetables that make delicious, light purÃ©es, and that you might want to include in your Thanksgiving menu. But the prospect of a first course with the additional bowls and soup spoons to place and clear, when the main course and trimmings and dessert are the real focus of this meal, gives me pause.  But this year I found a solution, and it solves not just the soup conundrum but also the problem of what to serve before the meal, when guests and family are trickling in, maybe some people are watching football, and you need and want to serve something good without filling people up too much. I will be  serving soup shots in demitasse espresso cups. They wonât require spoons, as four of the choices are purÃ©es and one is a consommÃ©. I made creamy, comforting purÃ©ed soups (with no cream) with humble vegetables that you can find in the supermarket (celeriac may be the exception, but my local Iranian supermarket always has it): carrot and parsnip; mushroom; celeriac, potato and apple; and turnip, potato and leek. The other is a delicious mushroom consommÃ©. They are all nourishing and light, leaving plenty of room for the rest of the meal. Once Thanksgiving is past, think of these soups as light meals in themselves; they will come in handy as you look for ways to shrink your calorie intake during the holiday season and after.
