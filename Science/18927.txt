In this week’s Recipes for Health, Martha Rose Shulman explains the art of poaching an egg. She writes: When I was a caterer I learned that you can poach eggs ahead — theyâll keep for several days in a bowl of cold water in the refrigerator. Just carefully drain and warm in a bowl of warm water. Not that theyâre any trouble to poach on the spot. Hereâs the very reliable method I use: Fill a frying pan with water — for one or two eggs I use my 8-inch omelet pan — and bring to a boil. Add a tablespoon of vinegar to the water. One at a time, break the eggs into a teacup, then tip from the teacup into the pan (do this in batches if necessary). Immediately turn off the heat under the pan and cover tightly. Leave large and extra-large eggs for four minutes. Smaller eggs, like the beautiful ones an urban farmer friend brought me from his henhouse the other day, will be done in three. Using a spatula or a slotted spoon, carefully transfer to a bowl of cold water. Before serving, drain on a clean dish towel.  Here are five ways to top off your meals with a poached egg.
