 Episode 22:  Dec. 12, 2017 Astronomers have discovered a passing rock from another star — the first interstellar asteroid. Episode 21:  Oct. 16, 2017 For the first time, astronomers have seen and heard a pair of neutron stars collide in a crucible of cosmic alchemy. Episode 20:  Sept. 8, 2017 NASA’s Cassini spacecraft will plunge into Saturn on September 15, 2017, incinerating itself after 20 years in space. Episode 19:  Aug. 30, 2017 Long after they have stopped communicating with Earth, the twin Voyager spacecraft will forever drift among the stars. Episode 18:  Aug. 14, 2017 On August 21, 2017, the moon will paint a swath of North America in darkness. The Great American Eclipse. Episode 17:  Sept. 5, 2016 NASA’s Osiris-Rex spacecraft will hunt down an asteroid and return a sample to Earth. Episode 16:  June 28, 2016 On July 4, 2016, NASA’s Juno spacecraft will arrive to study Jupiter after a trip of nearly two billion miles. Virtual reality:  May 19, 2016 Set foot on an alien world, three billion miles from the warmth of the sun. Episode 15:  Feb. 11, 2016 About a hundred years ago, Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves, but until now, they were undetectable. Documentary:  Oct. 28, 2015 After 11 years orbiting Saturn, NASA's Cassini spacecraft has changed our understanding of liquid water in the outer solar system. Documentary:  July 7, 2015 On July 14, 2015, the New Horizons spacecraft will zip past Pluto and its five known moons. Nobody really knows what it will find. Episode 12:  June 8, 2015 Astronomers hope the Event Horizon Telescope, a synchronized network of radio antennas as large as the Earth, will take the first ever picture of a black hole, an abyss so deep no light can escape. Episode 11:  April 24, 2015 After 25 years, the Hubble Space Telescope is still surprising us. Hubble has been called the most important advance in astronomy since Galileo, and its greatest discoveries might still be ahead. Episode 10:  April 2, 2015 The International Space Station is as far as humans go in space these days, but it is at just the right distance to capture astonishing images of Earth. Episode 9:  March 5, 2015 A century after Albert Einstein proposed that gravity could bend light, astronomers now rely on galaxies or even clusters of galaxies to magnify distant stars. Episode 8:  Feb. 4, 2015 Though it is sedate in comparison with other stars, our sun is a volatile neighbor, a thermonuclear furnace fueling spectacular storms that send high-energy particles and radiation far out into space. 纽约时报中文网:  Aug. 8, 2017 虽然和其它星球相比，太阳还算安静。但它仍是一颗多变的星球，一个形成惊人风暴并向宇宙发射高能量粒子和射线的热核聚变火炉。 Episode 7:  Dec. 18, 2014 In galactic nurseries like the Orion Nebula, clouds of gas and dust mingle, birthing new stars and planetary systems. The ALMA radio telescope made a recent observation of possible planets being born. Episode 6:  Nov. 5, 2014 Neptune’s moon Triton was the last stop on Voyager 2’s tour of the outer planets. It is one of the coldest objects in the solar system and a big brother of Pluto, which NASA will visit next year. Episode 5:  Oct. 8, 2014 Supercomputer simulations show the moment when a pair of neutron stars collide, collapse into a black hole and tear themselves out of the visible universe. Episode 4:  Sept. 3, 2014 Light from exploding stars can live on in the form of echoes, rippling across space and illuminating clouds of dust and gas that might otherwise be invisible. Episode 3:  Aug. 6, 2014 The sun is slowly rising over Saturn’s North Pole, exposing an immense six-sided hurricane. The storm, big enough to swallow four Earths, was first spotted by the Voyager missions in the early 1980s. Episode 2:  July 15, 2014 Astronomers have used a cosmic web imager to visualize simulations of dark matter, showing how the large scale structure of the universe grows and the nests in which galaxies are hatched. Episode 1:  May 28, 2014 Hubble Space Telescope measurements have confirmed that the Milky Way will collide with a sibling galaxy known as the Andromeda nebula in about two billion years.
