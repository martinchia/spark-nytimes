 To the Editor: Re “Treatment of Trauma to Brain Is Studied” (Oct. 12): After undergoing three brain surgeries, including a shunt implantation, I can empathize with those who have suffered from traumatic brain injuries. Understanding that every traumatic injury is different is a key factor in determining an effective form of treatment. Unfortunately, no one knows how someone’s brain will react to trauma, but during the recovery interim a form of cognitive therapy can be extremely beneficial. I hope that over time a well-developed plan of action will be created so the millions of Americans suffering from brain trauma can get the help they need. Bridget Whelan Fairfield, Conn.
