 One in eight public swimming pools inspected in 2008 were closed immediately because of serious health code violations, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Pools at child care facilities were the most likely to be shut down, with almost one in five closed immediately; the rate at hotels, motels and apartment complexes was one in seven. But it was kiddie wading pools and bathing fountains that had the highest rate of violations, indicating inappropriate disinfectant and pH levels in the water that could lead to transmission of germs that cause gastroenteritis. C.D.C. researchers analyzed data from more than 110,000 routine pool inspections drawn from a sample of 15 counties and states. Of 111,487 inspections, 13,532, or 12.1 percent, identified serious violations that led to immediate shutdowns. Michele Hlavsa, chief of the centers’ Healthy Swimming Program, encouraged swimmers to take their own test strips to swimming pools so they could check the quality of the water before jumping in. “The pool inspector can’t be there every day,” she said. She urged bathers not to swim when they have diarrhea and never to swallow pool water, and she said parents should take their children on frequent bathroom breaks.
