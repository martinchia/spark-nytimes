 Serve tapenade, the Provençal olive paste, with croutons or raw vegetables. You can also make deviled eggs, mashing the tapenade with hard-cooked yolks to make the filling. 1/4 pound imported black olives, pitted 2 garlic cloves, halved, green shoots removed 1 1/2 tablespoons capers, drained and rinsed thoroughly with cold water 2 anchovy fillets (optional) 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary 2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1 can olive-oil packed light (not albacore) tuna Freshly ground pepper 1. Make sure that there are no pits mixed in with your olives. 2. Turn on a food processor fitted with a steel blade, and drop in the garlic. When finely chopped and adhering to the sides of the machine, stop the machine and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the remaining ingredients, except the tuna, and puree to a smooth paste. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the tuna and optional anchovies. Process until you have a smooth paste. Add freshly ground pepper to taste. Transfer to a bowl and refrigerate, covered, until ready to use. Yield: Makes about 1 1/4 cups Advance preparation: This will keep for three or four days in the refrigerator.
