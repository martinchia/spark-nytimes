 Eating whole-milk products instead of skim or low-fat ones may decrease the risk for a certain type of infertility, new research has found. Scientists found that women who consumed one or more servings of whole-milk products a day were 27 percent less likely to experience infertility caused by a failure to ovulate than those who ate less than one serving a week. At the same time, women who ate two or more servings a day of low-fat dairy food were almost twice as likely to fail to ovulate as women who ate less than one serving a week. Scientists followed more than 18,000 premenopausal women without a history of infertility over an eight-year period. In that time, there were 438 diagnosed cases of infertility because of failure to ovulate. The study appeared Feb. 28 online in Human Reproduction. The study found that an extra eight-ounce serving of whole milk daily had the greatest effect, cutting the risk of failure to ovulate by more than 50 percent. The effect of eating an extra half-cup of ice cream a day, however, was not statistically significant. Dr. Jorge E. Chavarro, the lead author and a research fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health, said that at least one previous study contradicted his results. “There is as yet no clear picture of the role of dairy food in fertility,” Dr. Chavarro said, and he was not prepared to recommend whole-milk foods to women trying to become pregnant. The authors acknowledge that some subjects may have already received diagnoses of ovulation problems and were therefore avoiding high-fat dairy products, and that this could have affected the results.
