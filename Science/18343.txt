 To the Editor: Re “Drinking Flat Soda Can Ease an Upset Stomach” (Really, June 3): The issue is not whether flat soda is an adequate means of electrolyte replacement, it’s whether the patient feels better afterward. In these terms, the testimony of thousands is that this “quick and popular” remedy does indeed help to “settle the stomach.” Whether the effect is real or a placebo hardly matters. Flat soda (for me, flat Coke) has been an effective home cure since I was an infant, and my personal experience inclines me to use it again when upset strikes. Would I rely on flat soda for serious dehydration? Would I “prescribe” it for a seriously ill infant? No, to both questions. Andrew BlankThe Hague Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
