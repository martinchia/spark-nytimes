Farmers’ markets have a reputation for being on the pricey side at times. But as Martha Rose Shulman points out in this week’s Recipes for Health, one vegetable that often presents a bargain is the cabbage. Last week I couldnât believe the size and beauty of the cabbages one farmer was selling by the piece. I bought one for $2, took it home and weighed it: five pounds on the dot. It made five terrific meals, all with ingredients I had on hand. Iâve been covering a lot of brassicas lately â those healthy phytochemical-rich cruciferous vegetables like kale, kohlrabi, broccoli and cabbage. Thatâs what we have plenty of at this time of year, and thereâs no reason to be bored with them. I stuffed the tough outside leaves of my big cabbage, quartered the rest and made a pizza, a pie, a stir-fry and the most wonderful baked beans Iâve ever eaten. Here are some ways to take advantage of a cheap and plentiful supply of fresh cabbage from your farmers’ market. Stuffed Cabbage Leaves: The tough outer leaves of a large cabbage are perfect for stuffing. Cabbage and Onion Marmalade: The sweet mixture that comes from slowly cooking these vegetables is perfect on a pizza that conjures the South of France. Cabbage, Onion and Sweet Pepper Tart: Think of this tart as a quiche that has traded in some of its eggs for an extra helping of vegetables. Baked Giant White Beans With Cabbage: The cabbage almost melts into the velvety bean broth in this dish, which gets a flavor boost from Parmesan. Stir-Fried Tofu With Cabbage, Carrots and Red Peppers: A variation of this colorful stir-fry substitutes thinly sliced chicken for the tofu.
