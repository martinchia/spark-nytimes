NASA’s Messenger spacecraft crashed into Mercury on Thursday.
 Mapping a planet Messenger spent four years orbiting, mapping and studying the planet Mercury. The spinnable globe above is a composite of thousands of photographs. Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and about 40 percent wider than the moon.

The spacecraft ran out of fuel on April 24 and crashed into Mercury’s northern hemisphere on April 30, at a speed of 2.4 miles per second. Liftoff Messenger was launched on Aug. 3, 2004. The name Messenger is an acronym for “Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging.” Passing Earth A year after launching, Messenger completed its first planetary flyby and looked back as it passed Earth. Six flybys Messenger performed a record-setting six planetary flybys, using the gravity of three planets to slow its speed and adjust its direction. Messenger flew by Earth once, Venus twice and Mercury three times. Entering Mercury orbit Messenger went into orbit around Mercury on March 29, 2011, and was the first spacecraft to orbit the planet. Polar ice in shadow Messenger confirmed that some craters near Mercury’s poles contain water ice, protected from the sun’s heat in pockets of permanent shadow. Hollows and vents Messenger has found flat depressions, top row, in many of Mercury’s craters. These “hollows” often have pale edges and may have formed where volatile materials were lost to space. Messenger has also discovered and photographed many volcanic vents, bottom row. Past contractions Messenger found evidence that Mercury’s iron core gradually shrank as it cooled over billions of years, cracking and buckling the planet’s surface. Lava flows Much of Mercury’s northern hemisphere is covered with smooth plains that were once flooded with lava. Crater rays and chains Pale rays extend hundreds of miles from many of Mercury’s craters, top row. Rays are caused by subsurface material ejected during impact and tend to fade over time. Material flung out of an impact crater can also make chains of small craters extending in a long line, bottom row. Final maneuvers, and one last image Messenger performed its final course correction on April 24, 2015, using the last of its fuel to delay its crash slightly. The spacecraft continued to send back pictures during its last orbit, but crashed with over 1,000 images in its memory that will never make it back to Earth.Today Messenger gouged a new crater in Mercury’s surface, though it will probably take a future spacecraft to find it.
