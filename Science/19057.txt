Iâve been saving up blueberry recipes. I know that  blueberries wonât show up in farmersâ markets in northern states until mid-June, but there are plenty now available in supermarkets from places like  Georgia, which grows 10 percent of the nationâs crop. In California, where blueberry production is a recent thing, begun successfully only in the 1990s, the harvest started in February. So Iâve been biding my time. I donât put much stock in the concept of âsuper foods,â but if you do, blueberries should be on your list. Their health benefits are well documented in the scientific literature. One study, published last year in BMJ, showed a correlation between the consumption of blueberries, apples and grapes, but especially blueberries, and a significantly lower risk of Type 2 diabetes. Scientists who are looking at foods that contain fibers that nourish probiotics, or beneficial microflora, in our lower intestines are finding that blueberries and other berries have a lot of potential in this area.  Martha Rose Shulman on healthful cooking. I used both blueberries and blackberries in recipes this week. Blackberries have many of the same types of phytochemicals that blueberries have, antioxidant-rich anthocyanins that are present in deep blue and purple fruits and vegetables. Blackberries are also high in tannins â thatâs what gives them their astringent flavor â that are also thought to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. I used the berries mainly in desserts and pastries (one, a blueberry buckle, is just a little bit decadent), but I also threw them into a salad.  One great thing about blueberries and blackberries is that they freeze exceptionally well, especially blueberries. All you have to do is make sure they are dry and seal them airtight in freezer bags or containers. You can throw them, frozen, right into baked goods. Toss them first with a very small amount of flour if you donât want them to bleed when they bake. Cornmeal and Buckwheat Blueberry Muffins: These muffins are the antithesis of the blueberry muffins on the counter in coffee shops, with plenty of fruit. Blueberry or Blackberry Compote With Yogurt or Ricotta: An easy compote can transform plain yogurt or ricotta into a substantial breakfast or even a dessert. Whole-Grain Blueberry Buckle: Topped with oats and quinoa flour, this old-fashioned cake is no longer traditional at all. Beet and Arugula Salad With Berries: The sweet-tart flavor of berries make a lovely contrast to the pungency of arugula and the earthy sweetness of beets. Berry Clafoutis: Not very sweet, this clafoutis works for either breakfast or dessert. Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
