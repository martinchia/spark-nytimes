 To the Editor: In “Love, Sex and the Changing Landscape of Infidelity” (Well, Oct. 28), Tara Parker-Pope reports that new statistics of marital infidelity reflect more women cheating on their spouses — i.e., “catching up with men” — than previously reported, especially in certain age groups. It has always been a mystery to me why people held on to the popular belief that men cheated with so much more frequency than women. Doesn’t it take two people to have an affair? If it really were true that most of the partners of the men were single women, the sociologists and psychologists would have to explain this (self-defeating, but possibly evolutionarily sensible?) thinking. Susan Berenzweig Mamaroneck, N.Y.  To the Editor: Regarding the “Changing Landscape of Infidelity,” it seems to me, anecdotally at least, that one of several things must have been happening: 1. Unless each of thousands of men who have admitted being unfaithful are having an affair with the same one or two women, there must be a fairly equal number of adulteresses, or women who are otherwise knowingly complicit in men’s infidelity. 2. Men have overstated their affairs. 3. Women have understated theirs. Peter R. CohnDenver Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
