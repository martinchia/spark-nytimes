 Commercial fishing is a dangerous occupation, and fishing for Dungeness crab off California, Oregon and Washington may be the most dangerous of all. In the 1990s, safety improvements in the Alaska fisheries led to substantial declines in that state’s commercial fishing fatalities. But the fatality rate from 2000 to 2006 in the Northwestern fishery was more than twice the rate among all fishermen, and almost 60 times the rate for all American workers. The figures were reported in the April 25 issue of The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The Coast Guard monitors the commercial fishing fleet. But the law that covers safety for commercial fishermen focuses on saving lives after the loss of a vessel, not on preventing ships from capsizing, avoiding injuries or keeping people from falling overboard. Twenty-three boats capsized in  that six-year period, resulting in 43 deaths, and none of these people were able to enter a functioning life raft. Just three of the lost boats had valid safety decals from the Coast Guard’s voluntary dockside safety examination. “The next step is to ask fishermen about these numbers,” said Jennifer Lincoln, an injury epidemiologist with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. “In order to come up with practical solutions, the people affected have to be at the table.” NICHOLAS BAKALAR  A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F7 of the New York edition with the headline: Northwest Fishery Posts Highest Fatality Rate.
