 When several preschool teachers in Los Angeles fell sick last April after eating brownies, public health investigators suspected it wasn’t a typical case of food poisoning. The symptoms included giddiness, dizziness, mood changes, dry mouth — and a bad case of the munchies. One of the teachers had bought the homemade goodies a few days earlier from what she thought was a church bake sale; she shared them with colleagues during a work break. But within 90 minutes of eating just one brownie each, five teachers became ill; the adult son of the buyer also reported symptoms. It turned out there had been no church bake sale. And a leftover piece of brownie tested positive for cannabinoids found in marijuana, according to a report of the incident published Sept. 4 in The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Stella Fogleman, the first author of the report, said that none of the teachers had used marijuana before and that they did not like the way it made them feel. “They didn’t know they were eating pot brownies, so it’s not the same symptoms as someone who deliberately ate them at a party and got high,” Ms. Fogleman said. Two teachers sought medical attention for their symptoms, and one patient tested positive for THC, the active ingredient in marijuana metabolite. All have recovered. The sidewalk vendor who sold the treats, for $1.50 each, has not been found.
