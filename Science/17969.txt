 New Caledonian crows, found in the South Pacific, are among nature’s most robust nonhuman tool users. They are well known for using  twigs to dislodge beetle larvae from tree trunks. And there’s a good reason. By foraging for just a few larvae, a crow can satisfy its daily nutritional needs, which explains the evolutionary advantage of learning how to use tools, researchers report in the journal Science. Using an infrared video camera, the researchers studied the crow’s method of capturing larvae. The crow uses twigs to poke at a beetle larva until the larva becomes so agitated that it grabs onto the stick with its mandibles, at which point the crow yanks out the twig, having successfully captured its prey. “We found that these grubs are very nutritious, they have very high fat content and they contribute disproportionately to the diet of these birds,” said Christian Rutz, a zoologist at Oxford University and one of the study’s authors, in a prerecorded interview.

But what remains unknown is why tool use has evolved in only certain animal lineages and not others, and why tool use is generally uncommon among animals.
