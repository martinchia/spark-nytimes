 To the Editor: “Flying Machines, Amazing at Any Angle” (Jan. 4) quotes a biologist’s suggestion that the future of human flight will incorporate birds’ remarkable shape-shifting abilities. There is nothing new about this. Many hours of observing birds in flight provided the Wright brothers with the insight they needed to develop an airplane that could bank and turn. Their observation that turning birds change the shape of their wingtips led to their great innovation of wing warping — the direct ancestor of the ailerons used on modern planes. Lawrence P.
