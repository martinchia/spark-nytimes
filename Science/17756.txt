 The number of malaria deaths in India far outstrips World Health Organization estimates, according to a study released last week. The authors argue that estimates should be revised upward for the whole world, particularly among adults. The study, published in The Lancet, estimated that 205,000 Indians die of malaria each year, which is nearly 14 times the W.H.O. estimate of 15,000. The new survey, part of India’s continuing Million Death Study, was done with a grant from the National Institutes of Health in the United States, among other donors. It relied on “verbal autopsies” of 122,000 deaths from 2001 to 2003. Hundreds of field workers interviewed family members about symptoms their relatives showed before dying, and dozens of doctors reading those interviews ascribed probable causes of death. The survey found that 90 percent of the deaths diagnosed as resulting from malaria were in rural areas, and 86 percent took place away from hospitals or clinics. Since most malaria victims who see doctors in time can be cured, India’s medical system vastly underreports malaria deaths, the authors argued, and W.H.O. estimates rely largely on confirmed cases with adjustments for underreporting. In an editorial accompanying the study, three malaria experts pointed out that several other malarial countries have large rural populations with little access to doctors, including Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Myanmar, so global estimates of malaria deaths may be low. A version of this article appears in print on October 26, 2010, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: EPIDEMIOLOGY: Indian Study Suggests Malaria May Kill Many More Than Feared.
