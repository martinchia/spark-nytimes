 To the Editor: Re “Tossing the Formula” (Oct. 16): Hospitals ending their partnerships with formula companies should be only the beginning of formalizing our nation’s support for breast-feeding. There needs to be some infrastructure in place to support new mothers, especially those in low-income households. While nursing is free, both a high-quality breast pump and a visit from a lactation consultant cost several hundred dollars. Other than the La Leche League, what are the free or low-cost options available to mothers? Amy Horowitz Montclair, N.J. To the Editor: In Oregon, we asked 3,895 women about free formula and breast-feeding. Women who did not receive free formula breast-fed their infants significantly longer than those who received free formula. Hospitals should not be subverting breast-feeding by implying that infant formula is endorsed by doctors, nurses and hospitals. Kenneth D. Rosenberg Portland, Ore. The writer is an epidemiologist with the Oregon Public Health Division. To the Editor: That even women who are probably considerably more informed than the average new mother feel the pull of these marketing materials points to the true power of this industry tactic. The formula industry is well aware of the effectiveness of sample giveaways in hospitals, which is why it fights against efforts to stop the practice. In April, Public Citizen sent letters to 2,600 hospitals calling on them to stop allowing formula marketing in their facilities. More than 15,000 people have signed an online petition calling on formula companies to stop this damaging marketing practice.

A version of this letter appears in print on October 23, 2012, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Push For Breast-Feeding.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
