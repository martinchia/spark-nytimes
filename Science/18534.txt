We have heard from a number of vegans and vegetarians that they often bring their own food to holiday events to be sure something will be served that they can eat. This portable recipe for Sweet Potato Pockets was created by Kathy Patalsky of Los Angeles. Ms. Patalsky came up with the recipe in college to bring to a family feast. “Since I love Thanksgiving, I didn’t want to miss out on any of my favorite dishes,” she said. “So instead of bringing multiple dishes and crowding the already crowded dinner table, I made these little gems. I wanted my entire vegan Thanksgiving meal stuffed inside a puffy pita pocket.” The only thing missing is the vegan stuffing, which Ms. Patalsky makes and serves on the side. “The first time I brought them to a traditional family dinner, everyone at the table raved about them,” she said. “I make this recipe every year no matter what. It always reminds me that anyone can be inspired to try a vegan lifestyle.”
