Team Type 1, a first-year professional cycling team that includes four riders with Type 1 diabetes, has won a berth in the Tour de Georgia, a major United States cycling race. The team is led by world-class cyclist Phil Southerland, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 7 months old. Mr. Southerland has been a trailblazer for people with diabetes and hopes to do for diabetes care and prevention what cyclist Lance Armstrong has done for cancer. The Georgia race is the team’s first step toward winning a berth in the Tour de France in 2012. Type 1 diabetes, which is often diagnosed in children, is a so-called autoimmune disease, in which the body’s immune system mistakenly destroys cells that make the hormone insulin. Everyone with Type 1 disease must monitor their blood sugar and food intake and take insulin injections. Athletes with Type 1 face special challenges because exercise can cause blood-sugar levels to drop precipitously. (Type 2 diabetes, the more common form of the disease, typically develops later in life and often can be controlled by dietary changes alone.) When Mr. Southerland  founded the team, it was made up entirely of riders who have Type 1 diabetes. Remarkably, that team in June  won the 3,053-mile Race Across America relay, beating seven other eight-member teams by cycling from Oceanside, Calif., to Atlantic City, N.J., in five days, 15 hours and 43 minutes. Last year, the team won corporate sponsorship and joined the professional circuit, setting the 2012 Tour de France as a goal. Four of the 15 riders on the Team Type 1 professional squad â Mr. Southerland, co-founder Joe Eldridge, Tim Hargrave and Fabio Calabria â have Type 1 diabetes. The team hasn’t yet announced which of its riders will compete in the Georgia event, but at least some of the riders with Type 1 will be there, team officials said. âFor the first time, weâll have riders with diabetes racing against guys who will be competing in the Tour de France,â Mr. Eldridge said. âThis is our opportunity to show the diabetes community, as well as fans of pro cycling, what we are able to achieve.â The 660-mile race begins Monday, April 21, on Tybee Island, near Savannah, and ends in the streets of Atlanta on Sunday, April 27.  It’s unlikely that the novice team will win the race, but team members say the team hopes to win at least a stage. Team Type 1 finished second at the Tour de Taiwan last week and second in the team classification at the Tour de Langkawi in Malaysia in February. Next week, the team will compete in the San Dimas Stage Race in San Dimas, Calif., east of Los Angeles, March 28 to 30. To read more about Mr Southerland and other athletes with Type 1 diabetes, read this story from The Times called “Diabetic and Determined.” I also wrote this story about Mr. Southerland for The Wall Street Journal last year. Comments are no longer being accepted. Excellent work!  My best wishes to the team.  I personally got into cycling to avoid getting diabetes (family history of type 2) and have benefited so much from it.  Its not just about diabetes anymore though. Just the kind of inspirational story I needed to read to move past “planning” to commute to work on my bike and make it happen starting next week! Thanks Tara! Cheers, Greg Hi Everyone, This story is very inspirational, and I certainly wish the team well, in all aspects of their lives! That said, I would also like to enter an element of caution. For most diabetics, I believe exercise is important, but it should be moderate-paced. I think it is essential to underscore this. Diabetes management is also very individual, so be “inspired” by the team, but don’t automatically think this level of endeavour is anywhere close to being correct for most diabetics. Everyone should start out very slowly, monitor themselves closely, get expert advice and see what happens from there. Take the chance to incorporate moderate exercise; it can really change your health. Start with walking. Best to all — Em

“Everyone knows someone who needs this information!” (TM) These folks are inspirational and strong, and provide a good example of how to adjust to and deal with a difficult disease. As a cyclist with diabetes, I find this story to be inspirational, but also that it addresses a specific problem that we diabetics often face while engaging in endurance activities- because moderate or intense physical activity causes all people to use insulin more efficently, we are faced with the issue of keeping our blood glucose levels from dropping.  The fact, however, that exercise makes our bodies more efficent should encourage everyone to be more active.  I’m curious how these athletes tackle this particular problem. All you type 1’s, be careful with extreme exercise. For all you type 2’s, 80% of you would not have the disease if you were of normal weight and engaged in moderate exercise. As an avid biker and a type 1 for 25 years, I find this story inspiring. Go TT1! As a type 1 who sometime has spikes or drops (where it goes, nobody knows!) with exercise, great job, guys! These are the stories you need to do more often. Go Phil, Joe and Team Type 1!   Prove everyone wrong. I just came back from a week-long camp in Santa Barbara called Diabetes Training Camp.   I am also participating in a project called Triabetes (triabetes.org)–12 athletes with type 1 are competing this September in Ironman Wisconsin.  Although most people will not become involved in sports at this level, what TT1 and other athletes with type 1 are showing is that it is completely possible, and anyone with that desire who has type 1 should go for it.  The Diabetes Training Camp is an excellent (and unique) resource for those trying to learn more.  I am so excited that TT1 has made this important step and it is inspiring to me to keep at my own goals.  YAY! To TPP: Is there anyway to get Jack banned from these boards if he won’t be nice?  Of course we can just skip or try to ignore his postings but he is quite disrespectful. As a type 1 diabetic and athlete, I love hearing these inspirational stories that make others aware that diabetes is not a life sentence and that you can live an active and healthy life. Thank you! As the mom of a Type 1 diabetic teenager who loves soccer, I know that exercise can through another monkey wrench into your insulin requirements. It requires more stringent monitoring. However, as these athletes know, exercise is the best thing for them overall.  Having an insulin pump is particulary beneficial here: you can disconnect the insulin pump during intense activity then later set it to a lower basal rate for hours after, overnight and teh next day after the execise. As a normal weight person with prediabetes (probably a genetic insulin secretory disorder, not insulin resistance), controlled by diet, I think it is important to remember that carbohydrate control is especially important for intense extreme exercise to avoid glucose spikes and swings.  Dr. Richard Bernstein’s (long time Type 1) Diabetes Solution book has a lot of information about “big inputs (of carbohydrates) make for big errors and big corrections, but small inputs (of carbohydrates) make for small error and small corrections).  In other words, it’s really hard to have wide glucose swings if carbohydrate intake is kept low (therefore insulin corrections and potential for dosing errors is low).  Athletes can burn primarily fat for energy, if enough transition time is allowed, instead of carb-loading for energy. I am a road cyclist and have been for about two years.  I have type one diabetes and have had it for 27 years…I’m 43.  Cycling has been and excellent form of exercise for me.  I love to run, I love to play soccer but find that managing blood sugar in those sports is more difficult.  Eating or drinking to raise BS while running is far from ideal as is stepping off the field of play to manage BS.  While I am cycling I can test my BS at a planned stop, and manage it by either intake of carbs or insulin as I ride.  I use a pump (Omnipod) which allows suspension of insulin very easily or a decrease in basal as easily or implementation of a modified (preprogrammed) basal rate for use while cycling.  Drinking some sports fluid or eating something while cycling does not lead to the nausea which frequently occurs while running or playing soccer.  I have also found that there is a very wide range of cycling abilities in the clubs I have been involved with from beginners who ride 20 miles at 16 mph to those who want to do 60-70 at 19-20 mph….you can find a group that will ride the right pace and distance for you if you look.  The men in this article are professional athletes and their level of fitness and training is way beyond what most of us will consider.  They do serve as a great inspiration though!   As is the case with any change in lifestyle, if you have type one, you should discuss it with you diabetes management team.  You need to decide as a team with you as the leader what exercise level is appropriate for you.  My moderate may be your extreme or your walk in the park.  If you are not someone who closely works with professionals in managing you diabetes, be careful! For me, before I became a better manager of my diabetes, the dangerous lows often occurred at night and so I always do a 3:00 AM BS test on the night of a big ride day.
