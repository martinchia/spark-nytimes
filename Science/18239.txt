 Blacks and Hispanics are less likely than whites to develop melanoma, but when they learn they have it, the skin cancer is often at an advanced stage, a new study of cases in Florida has found. The study, in The Archives of Dermatology, used data from the Florida Cancer Data System, a statewide cancer registry, to analyze 41,072 cases of melanoma diagnosed from 1990 to 2004. The cases included 39,670 in non-Hispanic whites, 1,148 in Hispanics and 254 in blacks. While 12 percent of white non-Hispanic patients had advanced cancer by the time they were given a diagnosis, 18 percent of Hispanic patients and 26 percent of black patients were at this later stage, when the cancer had already spread, the study found. “The simple message is that even though blacks and Hispanics are at lower risk, they can still get melanoma, but there seems to be a lack of awareness, so they’re diagnosed at a later stage,” said Dr. Robert S. Kirsner, the paper’s senior author and vice chairman of dermatology at the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Though the analysis was only of Florida cases, the state has a fairly large black population, and its cancer registry has been capturing data on Hispanic cancer rates since 1981. And, Dr. Kirsner noted, the state gets a lot of sun.
