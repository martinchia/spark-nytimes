 Q. What determined which trees and other plants survived after inundation by Hurricane Sandy? A. Whether plants survived or died depended chiefly on salt tolerance in the plant species, said Melanie Sifton, the vice president for horticulture at Brooklyn Botanic Garden. It is an adaptation built into plants that have evolved to thrive on or very close to the coast, she said. Coastal gardeners know that their plantings must be tolerant of salt water on their stems and roots and in the soil, whether from spray or actual inundation, Ms. Sifton said. In winter, road salts and ice melters are also threats. “During Superstorm Sandy, the ocean carried salt spray many miles inland from the coast,” Ms. Sifton said. “Soon after, inland New York City and regional gardens and parks were reporting yellowed leaves on several evergreen species like the native Eastern white pine, Pinus strobus, which showed yellowed needles from salt spray damage. But the white pine and other evergreens are resilient in the face of salty winds, and should make a full comeback after new leaves sprout.” The significant rainfall right after the storm probably helped to flush salt out of some gardens before too much damage occurred. “Some New York City waterside parks and gardens quickly irrigated their trees with fresh water in order to wash the salts out of the soil,” Ms. Sifton said.
