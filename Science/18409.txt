 A review of studies suggests that young and middle-aged people with slightly elevated blood pressure, or prehypertension, are nonetheless at much greater risk for stroke than those in the normal range. The National Institutes of Health define prehypertension as a systolic pressure (the top number) of 120 to 139 millimeters of mercury or a diastolic pressure (the bottom number) of 80 to 89 millimeters of mercury. Readings greater than or equal to 140/90 are considered hypertension. Scientists at the University of California, San Diego, reviewed 12 prospective cohort studies of prehypertension and stroke incidence covering more than 500,000 participants with follow-up periods as long as 32 years. The report appeared last week in the journal Neurology. The researchers found that people under age 65 with prehypertension had a 68 percent increased risk of stroke compared with those with normal readings, independent of other risk factors. There was no increased risk among people over age 65. Dr. Bruce Ovbiagele, lead author of the study and a professor of neurosciences at U.C.S.D., said this does not mean that people with prehypertension should start taking anti-hypertensive drugs. Instead, he said, they should “modify their lifestyle, maintain an ideal weight, lower their sodium intake. You shouldn’t be deceived because nothing seems to be going on.” A version of this article appears in print on October 11, 2011, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Prognosis: Slight Rise in Blood Pressure Carries Risk.
