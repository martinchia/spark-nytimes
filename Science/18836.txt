Susan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer. President Obamaâs initiative to advance personalized medicine depends on the sort of breakthroughs in cell biology that have produced cancer drugs like the one extending my life. Yet very few adults with cancer enroll in clinical trials. Why do many trials fail to enroll sufficient patients, when scientists now test less debilitating therapies than those commonly used?   I entered a Phase I trial in August 2012. Recurrences had proved that standard treatments could not eradicate my ovarian cancer. The pills from my trial, which I take at home, have kept the cancer at bay for more than two years — without destroying my appetite, muddling my mind, or dampening my spirit the way three cycles of chemotherapy did when infused intravenously in the hospital. A reader informs me that for seven months this same drug gave him a âwonderful respiteâ from an aggressive prostate cancer.   Instead of destroying all quick-growing cells as well as tumors, targeted drugs pinpoint cancer cells, enabling them to mature into normal cells or disabling them from reproducing. Researchers are using personalized medicine on virtually every type of malignancy with some success. A significant percentage of patients with leukemia have experienced a remission with the clinical drug AG-221, while the lives of a significant population of women with metastatic breast cancer have been extended by the drugs Kadcyla and Perjeta. Scientists in immunotherapy â which unleashes the immune system to kill cancer cells — have produced medicines that help people survive with metastatic melanoma and lung cancer.   Within trials for these sorts of drugs, therapies are free and participants who are not helped can drop out at any point. Yet according to the physician-author Wendy Harpham, only about 5 percent of adult patients receive treatment in trials and an estimated 30 percent of trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute fail to attract the minimum number of patients needed. The failure in enrollment can be partly attributed to the fact that trials must set scientific inquiry as their goal, not patient improvement. It is estimated that fewer than 6 percent of patients enrolled in a clinical trial will actually experience any kind of response to treatment. Of course patients who benefit from conventional interventions need not morph into guinea pigs.   But what of people who have reason to doubt the efficacy of standard protocols? And how come Phase II and III trials — where benefits are more likely to ensue — also fail to obtain the minimum number of patients needed? Are the astonishing advances that have been made in the treatment of childhood leukemia a result of the fact that more than 60 percent of children with cancer receive treatment through trials?   In any case, the barriers to participation remain legion. First of all, you need a Ph.D. to interpret the listings on the Internet. No, forget that: I have a Ph.D. and couldnât do it.   The data on ClinicalTrials.gov are daunting. Patients coping with enervating symptoms and fears may find it impossible to search through hundreds of trials involving their disease. At many cancer centers, there is no research officer to help patients locate suitable trials. I am grateful for a savvy physician at a university hospital who could dedicate her and her staffâs time to the paperwork of consent forms and to the scheduling all trials require. Oncologists outside research networks may not be able to keep up to date in a quickly changing field. And some make their money by dispensing the usual drugs on hand.   Additionally, trials have limited openings within limited temporal frames at research centers. The calendars of the patients must match those of the researchers, and patients in rural populations confront a disadvantage, as do lower-income patients. Even though I receive some help covering travel and accommodation costs, expenses usually exceed the amount of this compensation.  Strict inclusion criteria can also pose a problem. Only people with a particular mutation or a specific number of recurrences are eligible. Early stage trials involving what patients call sugar pills seem most disconcerting. Why risk being ârandomizedâ to the control arm of a trial in which participants do not receive the experimental drug, although they generally do receive standard care as part of the study? For all these reasons, the premature termination problem of trials appears to be over-determined. Some of these factors need to be addressed by scientists and by regulatory as well as funding agencies, if the number of patients enrolled in trials is to increase.   Even when a trial is identified as appropriate and available, making the decision to enroll may plunge people into anxiety. The upcoming PBS film “Cancer:  he Emperor of All Maladies,” produced by Ken Burns and directed by Barak Goodman, shows how heart-wrenching it can be — especially for parents of children with cancer — to embark upon an experimental protocol, but also how such studies have produced advancements in treatment and in scientific knowledge. President Obamaâs mother, who died of ovarian cancer at 52 in 1995, did not have the benefit of those advances.  Without harboring false hopes for a cure, more patients with recalcitrant cancer might attempt to lengthen their lives while extending research. Too often they find themselves stymied. The fault, to my mind, lies not in the patients but in the systems. Informed of the risks as well as the possible advantages, people should be enabled to choose not only among conventional approaches but also between the old protocols and the new.
