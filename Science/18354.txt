 In transplanting corneas, the current practice is to reject any donor older than 65. But a new study finds that corneas of people up to 75 years old appear to work just as well. The analysis, which appears in the April issue of Ophthalmology, is a randomized prospective study of 1,090 people getting cornea transplants. Surgeons were randomly assigned suitable transplant tissue for their operations and did not know the ages of the donors. Five-year graft survival rates — defined as needing a regraft or having a cloudy cornea that compromised vision — was 86 percent for the group of donors under 65 and exactly the same for the group older than 65. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the reasons for failure. “Older corneas are just as good for transplantation,” said Dr. Edward J. Holland, a co-author of the study and a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Cincinnati, “and the significance of this study is that surgeons now have scientific evidence that they can use older donors. Potentially, this expands the donor pool considerably.” The authors acknowledged that their sample included only patients with corneal disease that was considered a moderate risk for graft failure and that their results might not apply to people with more serious illness.
