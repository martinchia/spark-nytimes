Solve a medical mystery with Dr. Lisa Sanders. On Thursday we challenged Well readers with a difficult real-life case of a middle aged man who developed chest pain that radiated to his neck, followed by a persistent and loud whooshing in his ear. You were asked to figure out what was causing this patientâs pulsatile tinnitus and why he developed it. While several of you got half of the answer, as of this writing, no one put together both halves of the puzzle. The pulsatile tinnitus was caused by… A fistula between his vertebral artery and vein. The fistula and other visible vascular abnormalities were caused by… Fibromuscular dysplasia. Two previous winners of the “Think Like a Doctor” contest were the first to come up with part of the correct answer. Dr. Errol Levine, a retired radiologist from Santa Fe, N.M., correctly identified the disorder as fibromuscular dysplasia, though he did not identify the cause of the tinnitus. Dr. M. Noelle Knight, a veterinarian studying for a Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania, correctly identified the cause of the noise as a fistula.  This is the first “Think Like a Doctor” case that has not had a clear winner. Reviewing the answers, reader JK identified one of the barriers to solving the mystery: the imaging was confusing taken in context of the patientâs story. The patient complained of a noise in his left ear, but the imaging shows abnormalities that are much more striking on the right side than the left side. I donât know why that happened. Theories welcomed. The Diagnosis 
Fibromuscular dysplasia, or F.M.D., is a mysterious and rare disease of the blood vessels. This disease was first described in 1938, when a 5-year-old boy suddenly developed very high blood pressure and was found to have abnormalities in the main artery leading to one of his kidneys. When that kidney was removed, his blood pressure returned to normal. In the nearly 80 years since, these abnormalities have been found in virtually every major artery system in the body, although they are most commonly found in those of the kidney and, as was found in this case, those leading to the brain. Ninety percent of the time, fibromuscular dysplasia affects women, usually in middle age. It is not clear why. In some cases there may be a genetic component, though no pattern of genes that seem likely to cause the condition have been found. In patients with F.M.D., fibrous tissue collects in specific artery beds, sometimes completely blocking blood flow. With nowhere to go, the blood accumulates, causing the vessels to bulge and often rupture. Some patients with F.M.D. never develop symptoms. Their diagnosis is discovered accidentally when the affected region is imaged for some other reason. And most of those who have symptoms can be treated, with a full resolution. The specific symptoms depend on which arteries are affected. If the vessels to the kidney are involved, then patients usually develop high blood pressure. If the carotid or vertebral arteries to the brain are involved, patients can have symptoms ranging from something as serious as a stroke to symptoms such as headaches, vertigo or lightheadedness, depending on which vessels are involved and how significant the blockages are. Fistulas are abnormal connections between adjacent structures. Patients with F.M.D. can develop fistulas when arteries rupture. Usually when an artery bursts, the blood simply pumps into the surrounding space. When this happens, patients often bleed to death within their own body. However, sometimes the rupturing vessel can fuse with the vein that usually accompanies it. Veins are flimsier than arteries because the blood that they carry from the body back to the heart is under much less pressure. And because of this, the high pressure jet of the ruptured artery can knife its way into the vein, forming an abnormal connection, or fistula, between the two vessels. This patient had a fistula between the vertebral artery in his neck and the accompanying vein. The connection may have saved his life, but because veins are not built to withstand such pressure, the danger of life-threatening rupture was ever present.  How the Diagnosis Was Made The patient put up with the constant and loud whooshing in his ear for almost a year. Finally he went to see an ear specialist, Dr. Reid Lachman. Hearing the patientâs story, and the very loud noises that his stethoscope transmitted from the patientâs neck, Dr. Lachman sent the patient for imaging studies. Those studies showed that the blood vessels that brought blood to and from the brain were wildly abnormal. So abnormal that he wasnât sure what to do. Dr. Lachman referred him to a local vascular surgeon. Like Dr. Lachman, he saw the abnormality but wasnât sure what was going on. He referred the patient to a neurosurgeon in New York City, who looked at the same images and pronounced the patient fine. The pulsatile tinnitus couldnât be fixed, the patient was told. But at least he was in no danger. Hearing that, the patient was relieved but not satisfied. The problem he had might not kill him, but the noise would definitely drive him crazy. He had one more doctor’s appointment scheduled that day — this one with a radiologist who specialized in interpreting scans of the blood vessels in and around the brain. A guy at his local pharmacy had seen him for something and said he was great. And at that point he had been willing to see anyone. But did he really want to see two doctors in one day? He considered just skipping the meeting but didnât. He walked to the subway and took the long ride downtown. One More Doctor The patient met Dr. Maksim Shapiro in a shabby conference room deep in the heart of NYU Langone Medical Center. Dr. Shapiro, a young doctor with a trace of an Eastern European accent, sat down at the battered wooden table and listened to the patient describe the terrible episode of chest pain followed by the loud rhythmic whoosh. Like Dr. Lachman, the ear specialist that the patient had seen, Dr. Shapiro put his stethoscope on the patient’s neck. He too was struck by the loud pulsations. Then he turned his attention to the scans the patient brought. They were remarkable. The two sets of vessels that normally flank the spine, carrying blood to and from the back of the brain, now seemed to wander up the neck as if they were lost. And the vessels were no longer the smooth hoses they are normally supposed to be. Instead there were narrow spots followed by tiny ballooned-out bulges, making the blood vessels look in places like a disorderly string of beads. Most concerning were the veins, which are normally mere weak sisters of the more rugged arterial vessels, but in this patient were dangerously fat and full. It was clear where the noise was coming from, Dr. Shapiro told the patient. He pointed to the tangle of vessels. The vertebral artery, a high pressure vessel carrying blood from the heart, had become fused to the much weaker vein in an abnormal connection known as a fistula. It was as if a fire hose (the artery) was now hooked up to a garden hose (the vein) and a devastating rupture was just waiting to happen. He was very lucky that it hadn’t already. Why did this happen, the patient asked? Is this what caused his terrible chest pain? Had he been walking around with this ticking time bomb in his brain ever since? Fistulas like this occur when an artery ruptures and the high-powered jet of blood knifes into a vein rather than pouring out into area around the vessel. (If that had happened, the patient could have bled into his brain and died.) It was a lucky linkage but unsustainable. Fortunately it can be fixed. A rupture is usually quite painful, so maybe that’s what happened back then. It’s hard to know for certain. But what he did know, Dr. Shapiro told the patient, was what they had to do now. They needed to block off the abnormal link between the artery and the vein. And soon. As for why it happened, there was more bad news. The beaded necklace look of his arteries suggested that the patient had a rare and mysterious disorder known as fibromuscular dysplasia. A couple of weeks later the patient had a four-hour procedure to seal off the abnormal vessels. To do this, Dr. Shapiro fed foot after foot of a thin platinum wire into the bloated veins in order to cause the blood to clot, closing the vessels off for good.This prevents the vessels from rupturing and the body creates detours so that the brain is able to get the needed blood.  The patient knew that the procedure was successful as soon as he woke up. The whooshing that had kept him company for the past year was finally gone. Diagnosing the Difficulty Unlike run-of-the-mill tinnitus, the cause of pulsatile tinnitus can usually be identified. Problems in the ear itself can cause it. So can rare tumors in the ear and skull. But nearly half of the time an audible pulsation in the ear can be linked to a vascular cause.  Dr. Lachman understood this and sent the patient to get imaging studies of the vessel in and around the brain. The CT angiogram done at that time was quite abnormal. So much so that Dr. Lachman wasnât sure what to do. He sent the patient to the vascular surgeon who was also uncertain and referred the patient to a neurosurgeon. Each of these doctors reviewed the scans and tried to understand what they meant. Each was unsuccessful. The National Academy of Medicine, formerly known as the Institute of Medicine, released a report last fall on diagnostic errors and how they might be prevented. One of their recommendations was that physicians regularly enlist the help of other medical professional to make difficult diagnoses. The report identified, in particular, the fields of pathology and radiology as essential partners in interpreting studies to help make a correct diagnosis. All of the specialists seen by this patient had access to the images done by Dr. Lachman. The radiologist who first evaluated the images listed fibromuscular dysplasia as a possible diagnosis in his report. It is possible that by reaching out to their own radiologists, these subspecialists may have made this diagnosis on their own. Instead the patient found a radiologist himself who immediately understood the pathology he saw. After the Diagnosis That was four years ago. The patient now sees Dr. Shapiro and an F.M.D. specialist a couple of times a year to try to catch any new problems. And there have been many. There’s no cure for F.M.D., and although many who have it never develop symptoms or have problems that can be treated and never be bothered again, that was not the case with this patient. He has had several ministrokes and lives with the knowledge that what he calls “the big one” — a fatal rupture of one of his affected arteries — can happen at any time. Still, he’s glad Dr. Shapiro made the diagnosis. From the start he felt like his body was trying to tell him something. He simply had to find a doctor who could hear what it was.
