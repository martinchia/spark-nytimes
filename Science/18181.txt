 To the Editor: Re “Anti-Love Drug May Be Ticket to Bliss” (Findings, Jan. 13): I was enjoying John Tierney’s piece on the double-edged sword of brain love chemistry when I was seriously taken aback. Did he say that humans are monogamous? Truly monogamous species don’t cheat on their mates. In my view, humans are serially monogamous by nature. If we could accept and nurture ourselves as such, we wouldn’t need to artificially diddle with brain chemistry. Lane Singer Boulder, Colo. Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
