I felt a little wistful the other day when, riding my road bike, I passed runners gliding by on the upper bridle path in Central Park. That used to be me, before the pain in my knees and hip made other workout plans. So I shifted gears, pedaled faster and contemplated the benefits of cross-training. Liz Robbins explores the people and culture of the marathon. Back in the 1970s, during the first running boom, runners obsessively piled on the mileage in their Nike waffle trainers. Today, with recreational runners training for first marathons and ever-older runners eager to stay active, people are trying to maximize their bodyâs potential without running it into the ground.  Coaching, tips and inspiration to get you race-ready. âIf you want to do a marathon, you really only need to do three runs a week,â said Neil Cook, the multi-sport program manager at Asphalt Green, a city-owned sports complex in Manhattan. The other two days, Mr. Cook said, should be spent on cross-training activities like cycling or swimming. Of course, he warns, those three days of running must be intense and concentrated workouts: speed, hills and a long run. Cycling is the best cross-training sport for runners, Mr. Cook believes, since it builds an aerobic base while maintaining range of motion. âIt forces your leg muscles to contract and increases the blood flow,â he said. âIf you do it properly, youâre not really straining on the bike, the muscles arenât getting that abused.â Cyclists tend to work opposing muscles â like the quadriceps and hamstrings â differently than they do when on foot. Indeed, recreational athletes who only run can end up with muscular imbalances, according to Bill Pierce, the director of the Furman Institute of Running and Scientific Training in Greenville, S.C. He and his colleagues wrote âRunnerâs World Run Less, Run Fasterâ (Rodale, 2007), which promotes a training program of three days of running (track repeats, tempo and long runs), plus two days of cross-training workouts. Clipless pedals that are adjusted to the length of the legs can help cyclists concentrate on a fluid cadence â which Mr. Pierce considers the most important feature of the cycling workout for runners. The average runnerâs cadence is 180 steps per minute. âIf you get on the bike and youâre riding at 90 r.p.m.’s,â you replicate that cadence, Mr. Pierce said. Runners still want to know the secret formula: the exact number of cycling miles (riding outdoors or spinning indoors) that correspond to running miles. There is no formula. âJust folklore,â Mr. Cook said. Time is the essence, coaches agree. Equal the time of how long you would normally run on a recovery day â say 45 minutes â in order to turn these so-called âjunk milesâ into a productive workout. As for other alternatives to running, many trainers and coaches recommend strength training or pilates, either after a run or on a cross-training day. Swimming, as triathletes can attest, provides cardiovascular benefits without impact. Runners could use a kickboard to improve ankle flexibility while swimming laps, Mr. Pierce suggested.  Friends of mine with foot and knee injuries swear by deep-water running to maintain fitness. I call pool running the poor-manâs solution to the underwater treadmill that Olympians like Deena Kastor have used while rehabilitating their own injuries. These professionals are privy to other luxury devices like the Alter-G antigravity treadmill, which the three-time New York City Marathon winner Paule Radcliffe trained on and which U.S. Olympic marathoner Dathan Ritzenhein told me he used last spring in his basement while he rehabilitated from a foot injury. Meanwhile, back on Planet Regular Runner, we each have our own methods for staying in shape while nursing or minimizing injuries. Give me the bike. âNothing will replace running â sport specificity is important for training for a marathon,â said Michael Conlon, a local trainer and coach of the Team in Training triathlon team in Brooklyn. âThere are those of us who canât, however, get away with running five days a week.â Thatâs why the New York Road Runnersâ editorial director Gordon Bakoulis, a former elite runner who coaches the Running Divas New York team, urges people to start cross-training before injury or age forces them into it. âThe goal is not so much to improve your performance,â she said, âthe goal is to stay injury free, which will, eventually, improve your performance.â   Comments are no longer being accepted. As a runner, I fully support this advice.  Last year, I decided I needed to stop cross-training in order to spend more time focused on running farther and faster.  I wound up with a femoral neck stress fracture that took me out for 6 weeks including both half marathons I’d been training for all summer and fall.  I’d managed to stay injury free the first couple years I’d been running and I attribute that to good cross training.  As soon as I stopped, a major injury happened. I’ve since learned my lesson and now incorporate spinning, other cardio and strength cross training as well as yoga every week.   Better safe than sorry!  Cross-training is your friend! Glad to see you’re not letting injury sideline you, Tara. If you have time, I HIGHLY recommend strength training, including work on your core. You will not believe what it adds to your running fitness, especially as your long runs get longer.  FWIW, my schedule includes 5 days of running, 1 day of cycling and one day of rest. To that I add 4 strength training sessions a week and 2 core sessions a week. Happy training! I also fully agree.  Cross-training has helped keep me injury free for years and it helps keeps things varied enough to help prevent burnout.   I also can’t speak highly enough of incorporating strength training into cross training schedules as well.  Just 2 sets of  6-8 moves is all it takes to get all your muscles and help you stay strong.  And for myself, weight training is key to weight maintenance becuase it preserves your lean muscle tissue from being burned during all that cardio you will be doing.  Fitness-oriented magazines usually have strength workouts in every issue, so you can find lots of different total-body moves and keep it switched up. I wanted to throw a question out there to everyone. I am 22 years old and ran my first marathon 2 weeks ago. I finished in 3:36 and felt great. I think I am going to try and make marathoning a way of life and I have always heard about the benefits of swimming. I would like to incorporate this into my running and 4-5 days of strength training.  I cannot, however, for the life of me find a consensus on a good swimming program for beginners. I have never done anything except recereational swimming and I am not great at it. Does anyone out there have any tips i.e. times and lengths for a swimming workout I can do 2 or 3 times a week. I really hate cycling.  Is the elliptical O.K.?  I know it’s a similar motion but it’s less pounding. P.S. I discovered that my watch has a timer that I can set to 1 minute for walk/jogs – which have hence become enjoyable! The cross-training benefits go both ways between cycling and running. Cyclists who put in a lot of miles tend to end up with lower than average bone density and are at risk for developing osteoporosis as they age. Running helps to maintain bone density and strengthen hamstrings, a muscle that tends to be weak among cyclists. And re: the formula for running miles vs cycling miles: I had always heard that the conversion factor was 4 – i.e. running a marathon is the equivalent of a century ride (100 miles), though the former puts a lot more strain on the joints than the latter . Swimfit is a good british web site with many different recommended training plans for a variety of aims and levels. I run 3-4 times in prep for first Marathon in fall – using tempo, hills, and long runs + biking and martial arts. Good luck Eme – the Run Less, Run Faster plan does not advocate elliptical as a good cross-train for running WHILE USING THEIR PLAN.  It’s pretty intense with 3 tough run workouts per week and the logic for no elliptical is that the motion mimics running too much to rest those muscles appropriately between runs.  However, if you’re not doing the 3 run workouts per week (tempo, speed/hills and long run), but instead have more easy running, elliptical would be a good, lower-impact cross-train option. Rowing is too rarely mentioned as valuable cross-training for runners – it can provide great aerobic and anaerobic workouts and helps strengthen a wide range of muscles, from quads to abs, back and shoulder.

//www.concept2.com/us/training/crosstraining/running.asp Re: swimming…It depends on your level…beginner, intermediate, or advanced… Look into a local Y.  They usually have good adult swim programs…they may even have a Master’s program.  I think Asphalt Green has a swimming program ( I saw an article on it somewhere).   I am currently training for my first Triathlon (Sprint) in August.  I don’t run (bad knees) however, I walk 3-5 miles every day.  I alternate swimming and biking 4 days a week too.  It seems to be working for me. I’d like to work with a coach but that isn’t an option for me right now. FYI:  Injuries and cross-training (which you probably already do) I don’t swim as a “quality” workout, I view it more as a fun workout and a way to just stretch out and be nice to my joints for a day but still get a good workout. I generally try to swin anywhere from 25-45 minutes just depending on what time allows.  I start with 10 minutes of freestyle.  And then change it up and do different things every 5 minutes (kick board, brest stroke, or backstroke) until I’m feeling tired. I would either talk to someone experience in swimming or get some pointers online, becuase if you don’t learn the propery stroke it’s really easy to strain your shoulder with the rotation.  good luck and have fun! Where are the data? Anecdotes don’t count. Taking it to the next level — try Master’s Swimming.  You need not be a competitive or elite swimmer, just willing to try your best.  The benefits of coached workouts and training partners are outstanding, and you’ll work harder and better than on your own. The US Masters Swimming Web site also has workouts posted for individuals who cannot or do not wish to find a formal program. The Concept2 Rower. Nothing even comes close for aerobic cross-training. a complete non-weight-bearing total body workout that strengthens your core while maintaining aerobic fitness. After using mine for over 20 years, i can’t figure out why nobody mentions it and why the models i see in gyms across the country seem so totally ignored. Taking it to the next level: I’m right up there with you (same age, although not quite the same marathon time.  Good for you.)  But unfortunately I have no answers.  I’ll be at the pool tonight (for the third time — although I swam as a kid).  I’m just here to second the request for a good beginners swim workout.  Can anyone point me in the right direction? tittnl: i suggest you try to find a masters swimming club that is close to you.  Although you might pay more than you would for rec swim or lap swim at the local public pool, you get the benefit of a coached swim session, a planned workout and the ability to swim with others who are about the same ability.  masters also gets around the problem of having to share a lane with other swimmers of different ability and workout plans.  it goes without saying that swimming is an incredibly difficult skill to improve, at least not without the benefit of coaching and observing the better swimmers, both of which masters provides.  as for workouts, many clubs post workouts on-line so, at the least, a quick web search should get you to a starting place.  very generally speaking, an average workout can take the average swimmer about 1 hour and cover about 3,000 yards.  that’s about 30 times 100 yards freestyle (2 laps/4 lengths in a 25-yard pool) at a 2:00 overall pace per 100 (including rest). I’m curious where you received your data about the average runner running at 180 steps per minute. Most recreational runners are “heel strikers” meaning that they land in front of their general center of mass (GCM) on their heel, roll through the bottom of their foot and then pick their foot out when the leg is almost at full extension or locked out. These people are typically at a much lower turn over than runners who run with a shorter stride, land on the ball of the foot, under their GCM and then pull their foot upwards under the GCM (called POSE, chi-running, evolution running etc)   For POSE the slowest recommended steps per minute is 180.  This is significantly higher than the “average” runner.  Try it out, buy a metronome (sold by seiko for swimmers etc) and set it to 90 bpm.  The tone will sound each time one of your feet (left or right) strike the ground.  I would venture that most of the “average” runners are not at this high of a cadence in their normal runs and likely only go above 180 when sprining short distances. Curious?  check out POSE, if you have running injuries it will make a world of difference.  I am a life time runner with multiple surgeries and a knee reconstruction.  I am now able to run without pain because I’ve changed the way I run. good luck On swimming, I agree with prior posters who said that runners getting started on swimming would be best advised to find a coach.  Because your cardio system is in good shape, you’ll be tempted/able to do fairly long swim workouts…but if your stroke isn’t right, you’ll screw up your rotator cuffs or back.  Start with some coaching to make sure that you’re not going to give yourself some kind of repetitive stress injury, then ramp up the swim distance/time gradually. As far as a century on the bike being equivalent to running a marathon…I don’t think so. I’ve ridden centuries (albeit painfully) on little to no training…try that with a marathon. If nature wanted us to run, there would be a lot more Tigers. Walking is every bit as good, but you dont get to brag about how many miles youve done, and you dont need $200 shoes.. My impression was that swimming (not the simulated running with a flotation belt) was counterproductive to running training, while a concept2 rower (also another great workout) would tend to build upper body strength/bulk that would be detrimental to running–great runners tending to looks somewhat emaciated. Is my understanding correct? Or is that thinking outdated? That anti-gravity treadmill is something else. Unless you are training for Boston or one of the other early spring marathons, XC skiing is a great way to cross train. Keep up a light running schedule and when the snow melts, you transition back to 100% running all fresh and happy.  Obviously not an option in all parts of the country, but here in the north it is a great way to get in long workouts with little joint stress.
If you are like me and can’t face the prospect of running 26 miles in one shot, try an XC ski marathon (generally 30 – 60 kilometers.)  Some of them are very famous and logistically challenging (thousands of racers), but there are many others where you will get to ski for several hours through beautiful trails with people of your ability but not too crowded; and there are good feeding and support stations, too.  In the Northeast they are on the website: //www.nensa.net (New England Nordic Ski Assoc.)
Happy Trails. I’m 51 years old, have been running since high school, and have run about 15 marathons.  I run about 5.5 miles each way to and from work almost every day.  (I.e., I do not give my body proper time to rest in between runs.)  I’ve never stretched before or after runs.  I buy the cheapest running shoes on sale and wear them until the heel is gone.  I’ve never had any problems with my knees or other injuries. I share this not to suggest my way of training is the best–or to brag–but to point out that anecdotes about people who suffer injuries with or without stretching or with or without cross training donât tell us very much.  Several studies recently have brought into question whether stretching helps prevent injuries (vindication!?).  Other than luck and being born with strong joints, itâs not clear to me what really helps prevent injuries. IMHO swimming is not counter productive to running if done properly. It loosens up our muscles and helps builds cardiovascular capacity. Also, it works muscles other than those used for running. It develops muscles ignored by running and therefore helps to balance our overall muscle development and thus prevents injuries — what cross training is all about.  Similarly, the concept2 rower need not bulk you up if you go for more repetitions at lower intensities. The main benefit for concept2 rowing is the development of the core muscles which greatly aids running and yes, prevents injuries. Great runners may look emaciated but they are probably more on the “wiry” side. Good luck to us all! Alter-G and G-Trainer not UL listed.
