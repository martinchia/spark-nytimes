 Syphilis, which was nearly eliminated from China under Maoist rule, is now the most commonly reported communicable disease in the country’s largest city, Shanghai, according to an article in The New England Journal of Medicine last week. The national rate of syphilis in babies of infected mothers, which can be disabling or fatal, is also soaring. “No other country has seen such a precipitous increase in reported syphilis cases in the penicillin era,” wrote the co-authors, who are from American, Chinese and British medical schools. They blamed two factors: First, the new market economy has made many men rich enough to buy sex from poor young women and men. Also, the traditional stigmatization of prostitution, along with authorities who fine sex workers or send them to so-called re-education centers, make both the workers and their clients afraid to go to clinics for testing.

Within a decade, sexually transmitted diseases were almost unknown in China, the authors said (while not mentioning the many other social restrictions imposed in that era that could have contributed). Advertisement To tackle the problem in today’s China, the authors suggest that national and local governments admit the problem and commit money to it. But they also suggest that private advocacy groups be encouraged to do screenings at bars, brothels and other sex venues using new rapid blood tests that need only a half-hour to wait for results. A version of this article appears in print on May 11, 2010, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: CHINA: A New Market Economy and Old Stigmas Lead to an Increase in Cases of Syphilis.
