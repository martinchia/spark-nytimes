 To the Editor: Re “A Young Life Passes, and a Ritual of Birth Begins” (Cases, Jan. 25): Dr. Mark S. Litwin describes “the anxiety associated with an old fashioned bris on a kitchen counter.” A mohel, who is a trained ritual circumciser, is a religious practitioner who uses sterile technique and the most modern methods. He performs the bris with an efficiency, tradition and warmth that elevate the moment and put parents at ease. As a full-time mohel on staff at both Long Island Jewish and North Shore University Hospitals, I can assure you that a traditional bris is done with compassion and dignity. A certified full-time mohel is usually far more experienced than a doctor who does ritual circumcisions as a sideline or hobby. Rabbi Paysach J. Krohn Kew Gardens, N.Y. A version of this letter appears in print on February 1, 2011, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Guardians Of a Ritual.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
