 One way to find out for sure how fit American children are is to put them on the same machine many of their parents use with varying degrees of enthusiasm: the treadmill. When researchers asked more than 3,200 people ages 12 to 19 to hop on to the machines, the results were not good. They found that about a third did not meet accepted standards for physical fitness. The results appear in the new issue of The Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine. The researchers, led by Russell R. Pate of the University of South Carolina, Columbia, drew on data generated by a long-term government study, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Over a period of three years, beginning in 1999, participants were interviewed in their home about their diet and exercise habits. Then they were asked to visit a mobile examination center, where they were put on the treadmills. They were given two minutes to warm up and then asked to exercise for two three-minute periods.

Those who described themselves as less active or who said they watched more television or played more video games did worse. The researchers said the test results represent “a significant public health problem.” Dr. Pate said the findings were troubling. “If you are low fitness as an adolescent, you’ll probably remain that way as an adult,” he said.
