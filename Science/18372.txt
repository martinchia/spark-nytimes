 For the first time, a device can measure the mass of a single molecule. Traditionally in mass spectrometry, tens of millions of particles are weighed to calculate the mass of a single molecule. But researchers from the United States and France have developed a device that can measure just one; they describe it in the journal Nature Nanotechnology as a vibrating, bridgelike structure that is only a couple of millionths of a meter in length. “One way to imagine it is like a violin string,” said Michael Roukes, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology and one of the study’s authors. “If you pluck a violin string it will vibrate at some frequency — so when a particle arrives on the resonator the frequency changes, and we’re measuring that change.” By measuring the change, the researchers are able to calculate a molecule’s mass, Dr. Roukes said. The instrument took the scientists 12 years to develop. A previous iteration of the technology did not account for where on the resonator a molecule landed, which, as with a violin, affects the shifts in frequency. To correctly determine a molecule’s mass, the researchers had to analyze measurements of about 500 identical particles. But the new technique allows them to take multiple measurements simultaneously and back calculate a molecule’s mass based on a single particle.
