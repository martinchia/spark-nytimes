Reader Question â¢ 1746 votes There is a growing body of research supporting the use of fish oil supplements to treat dry eye, an uncomfortable condition that arises when the eye produces fewer tears. But âthe jury is still outâ on whether they work, said Dr. Penny Asbell, a professor of ophthalmology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York who is leading a large trial of the supplement.  Previous studies of dry eye and supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids, the fats found in fish, have been small or inconclusive, she said. The study she is running, called the Dream trial, for Dry Eye Assessment and Management, will include 600 people, and will hopefully provide clear direction for patients and doctors. It is currently recruiting patients at two dozen locations across the United States.  Dr. Asbell noted that fish oil supplements can cost up to several thousand dollars a year. âIt behooves all of us to find out if it really is effective,â she said.  In the meantime, many doctors feel comfortable prescribing fish oil supplements based on current research.  The omega-3s in fish oil are believed to reduce inflammation. So if the dry eye is aggravated by inflammation of the eyelids or surfaces of the eye, it makes sense that a supplement would help, said Dr. Stephanie Marioneaux, an ophthalmologist in private practice in Chesapeake, Va., and a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. "Dry eye is pretty complex, and there is no cure,â she said. âTreating the inflammation, however, can improve some of the symptoms." Do you have a health question?
