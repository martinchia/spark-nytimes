 To the Editor: Re “Ear Doctors Performing Face-Lifts? It Happens” (Jan. 31): Every American Board of Medical Specialties board-certified otolaryngologist has rigorous training in facial reconstructive and cosmetic plastic surgery. It does not include cosmetic surgery below the neck, and we do not condone surgeons operating outside their training area. It must not be implied that otolaryngologists are not board-certified facial cosmetic surgeons. The American Board of Plastic Surgery and the American Board of Otolaryngology are both A.B.M.S. boards and certify their diplomates in cosmetic surgery. David R. Nielsen, M.D. Alexandria, Va. The writer is executive vice president and chief executive of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
