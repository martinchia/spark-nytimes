Oncology nurse Theresa Brown, an occasional contributor to the Well blog, writes about her decision to become a nurse. By Theresa Brown “You left teaching English for this?”  I’ve been asked the question so many times by so many people that it no longer surprises me. After all, who in their right mind would give up being an English teacher, an English professor no less who taught writing at Tufts University, to become a nurse?  I made a mid-life career change that many people, including a lot of nurses, do not understand, and certainly would not have made themselves. People often ask me if Iâm crazy. I’m not, but even I can admit that it’s an unusual choice requiring some explanation.  After having my son, I realized I wanted a job where I was expected to care about people, not grade or judge them. Then I had my twins, and my world turned inside out and upside down with the physical challenges of the pregnancy. The midwives who helped me through the pregnancy left a lasting impression, and when I mentioned my admiration for them, a friend who’s a nurse told me, âYou could do that job.â  Soon after that conversation, I decided to go to nursing school. Six years later, when my twins were 8, I got my R.N. But I don’t think even I fully understood my decision until the last night of the very last shift I would ever do as a nursing student.  That night an 11-year-old leukemia patient who had a fever arrived on my floor at a children’s hospital. He and his dad talked and joked with each other, started watching movies on the TV in their room right away, and passed an enormous bag of potato chips back and forth. I got the impression they were trying to convince us, and themselves, that an impromptu hospital stay could be fun if you just had the right attitude.  Some other nurses had warned me that this family was “difficult,” but they seemed O.K. to me. The dad had a bad back and asked repeatedly for more pillows. (I’m not sure why, but pillows are a rare commodity in hospitals. I searched both wings of the floor until I found some for him.) The patient, testing out some preteen behaviors, could be rude, so I teased him about saying “please” and “thank you” as I handed over cartons of apple juice. I described him to the resident as “cheeky,” but I liked him.  Around 4 a.m., I went to check on him. As I walked into his room he looked up at me in the darkness and said, “It feels like I can’t breathe. My chest hurts.” Alarm bells went off in my head, scaring me and drowning out some of my confidence. “Oh, gee, that sounds bad,” I thought to myself. “What am I going to do about that?”  But then I did all the things nurses do: made sure he could breathe, called the resident about his change in status, and quickly left to retrieve the equipment to take a set of vitals.  When I got back to the room, the boy said he needed to go to the bathroom. I helped him walk, but halfway there his knees buckled. He cried out, “I can’t see! I can’t see!” I held him up, then picked him up and somehow got him into the bathroom and onto the toilet. I took his blood pressure twice. It was 70 over 30, much too low, and probably the cause of his temporary blindness. When I checked to make sure he was safe sitting on the toilet by himself he yelled out, “Can’t a man take a crap in peace?”  The doctors were worried that his low blood pressure meant he was going into septic shock and decided he needed the more intense technical support available in the pediatric intensive care unit.  Around 5:30 in the morning, and before the transfer to intensive care, I went to check on him. The room was still dark as night, and I hoped he had fallen back asleep. Instead, he spoke to me. His earlier cheekiness was gone, and I found myself confronted by a very scared 11-year-old boy.  “Why couldn’t I breathe?” he asked. And âWhy did my chest hurt?â And âHow come I couldnât see?â  Answers and pieces of answers swirled around in my head. Everything I thought of seemed overly technical, but also just inadequate. I offered him answers, mostly having to do with his low blood pressure, but in my concern for him I wasn’t putting together everything I knew. However, right or wrong, convincing or unconvincing, my responses comforted him. He stopped talking and relaxed back into bed.  Our brief conversation could be categorized as “patient education,” but my patient and I exchanged something more substantial than information when we talked. He found a way to ask, “What’s wrong with me?” and “Am I going to die?” And I told him, “I don’t completely know, but whatever happens I am here with you.” There we were, nurse and patient, talking quietly in a dark room, confronting the vagaries of life and death. For me this moment finally put to rest any questions I had about why I quit being a professor and became a nurse instead. My patient and I confronted the human condition during our brief talk. I answered his questions, and I met his fear with compassion.  By 8 that morning he went off to the P.I.C.U., and I never saw him again. I ended up overstaying my final shift and missed out on a celebratory breakfast with my friends. I never again worked at the children’s hospital but took a job in adult medical oncology that began once I finished school. I have no idea how things turned out for that boy, but I hope he’s still watching movies and eating potato chips.  In my job now, as with most hospital nursing, I see it all: the struggles with treatment, the confrontation with death, the successes that gladden all our hearts. It’s messy and stressful and I wouldn’t exchange it for a dream classroom full of well-read, hard-working, intellectually curious college students â not in a million years, not ever. For where else can I go to sample daily the richness of life in all its profound chaos. Comments are no longer being accepted. Yeah, I’d think for most people being a nurse is much more exciting than being an English professor. How many TV shows feature English professors as main characters? I am gratified that your voice is heard by Parker-Pope. Nurses and nursing are not routinely covered in any serious healthcare reportage.  Yet, the almost 3 million nurses in the US provide about 95% of all reimbursed health care services. Patients who are cared for by nurses with a minimum of a baccalaureate nursing education suffer less morbidity and mortality. Only about 1/3 of nurses possess this level of education. Yet, the nursing and nursing faculty shortages are becoming ever more critical, as unmanageable patient case loads and horrid practice conditions, not to mention the salary disparity and disrespect accorded to nursing faculty, drive the best from the profession. Nurses, just as you describe, connect with patients on their level where their most intimate and critical needs are, and they empower them to live their lives with dignity, quality and respect.  I think it may be the intimacy which tips the public into keeping nurses at arm’s length, lest their own vulnerabilities be revealed.  This hurts everyone. The stark reality is that at the root of almost all healthcare failures lies the absence of professional nursing.  It was at the bottom of the Walter Reed Army Med. Center problem, the cause of patients falling into health care coverage gaps, and is at the root of the failure to connect all people with primary and preventive care. Please keep writing and consider speaking to the policy and professional issues facing nurses and nursing.  For this is the only profession which is specifically charged with patients’ health and well-being. //revolutionredux.wordpress.com
//universalhealth.wordpress.com This probably won’t be put on the site. You usually don’ t print my comments because they aren’t glowing approvals. I’m sick of the nurse as hero/noble figure stories. I’ve been in and out of hospitals my whole life (thank you cancer) and the vast majority of nurses I have had to deal with are rude at best, downright sadistic at worst.  Why not publish something from the beleaguered patient’s perspective about the denial of dignity that most nurses practice? I don’t see why Jack has to put down the intellectual life because it can’t be made into an exciting television show.  The life of the mind can be plenty exciting.  To each his/her own. My wife and I have 60 years of shared professional nursing experience. We have seen it all. But nothing has really changed in the past 30 years. We still have a fragmented “system” of health care that does not value nursing care. Nursing still gets dumped on by both physicians and administrators. Faculty salaries are still in the cellar. Professional nursing itself is still run by a plump flock of  painted birds publishing studies read only by eachother.
Why do we do it? We actually care about our patients and want them to do well. We take pride in their strengths, work with their weakness, weep when they die.
And when the economy tanks, we are still be able to feed our families-unlike some of the investment bankers. And we don’t really need a bailout…just a back rub. Lovely article. I think teachers can also “sample daily the richness of life in all its profound chaos” if we remember that we are not just teaching students and dispensing grades but also interacting with other human beings who live complicated lives and really want not to be zombies as they go through school. Finally, a Well article that’s not anti-doctors, anti-medicine, anti-hospitals, anti-surgeries, etc., etc.  Truly inspiring. I’ve been a Registered Nurse for 40 years; considered in high school  becoming an English teacher! How happy I have always been with the decision I made; welcome to you. You seem to be exactly what  a nurse should be. After working as a chemistry teacher in a public high school for 2 decades, I  also wanted to make the career change to nursing.  My classmates and I are scheduled to graduate in May.  The press still reports that there is a severe shortage of RNs, but hospitals have stopped hiring new grads, and are increasing patient loads on the nurses they now have to save money in a tight economy.  I never expected to spend four years becoming a nurse, only to find that no one will hire a new grad.  Last year every new grad at my nursing school was hired.  This year, only a small handful out of over 100 new grads will find jobs. To Jane, you should have had me as a nurse.  If you were cranky or comatose, charming or complex, each of my patients got the same dose of loving care from me.  I utilized every resource and practical experience I could summons to make a stay in the hospital comfortable and short.  Funny thing, all along I got back more than I gave.  It is wonderful when nursing is chosen as a second life chapter.  Hurrah for Ms. Brown! I loved being an engineer. While I started engineering school, I thought that I could not work under pressure. Then I discovered that I could and it got to the point where the only way I could work was when I was under pressure. I was hired off the street while a graduate student at Columbia Engineering by a startup that grew into New York City’s largest environmental planning firm. I was in top notch physical condition then and often worked 36 hours in 36 hours on any of the firm’s upcoming projects. I played a critical role  in helping the firm pass its first milestone, working for 84 hours without sleep so that it could produce a key environment report with less than a week to do it. Our excellent delivery under less than optimal conditions established our credibility with our customers and with the regulatory agencies and propelled us into the big time.  The world has changed and I have not been working as an engineer for many years. I am an IT security specialist, where IT security specialists are probably the technical elite of the IT world and don’t exactly come a dime a dozen. That part hasn’t changed: I am still pushing to be the best of the best. As for wearing a suit or a uniform, screw that. As a tough professional in a different, high pressure field that changes as fast as quicksand, my hat is off to you, nurse Brown. “I got my R.N.” ? I’m no English professor, but that can’t be right.  R.N. means “Registered Nurse”, its not the degree you received.  Nursing degrees are BSN (Bachelor of Science Degree in Nursing) or ADN (Associate Degree in Nursing).  So one should say either “I got my BSN” or “I become an R.N.” But, again, I’m no English professor.  I’d give you the benefit of the doubt, but it was just Tufts. FROM TPP — As I would imagine you are well aware, this is a common phrase — “getting your R.N.” or “getting your M.D. or PhD” — to explain the point at which you fulfilled all the requirements that allow you to place a particular set of letters after your name. It’s good to know you embraced the spirit of the piece, though. :) My screen name says almost all. I too made a career change, from indifferent lawyer to caring, compassionate and successful nurse. Many people have questioned why I made the change I did, and I have met a number of lawyers who started out as nurses.
I have never regretted my decision. I help people every day to return to the lives they left behind when they became ill or injured. I get a lot of respect from people that I suspect would not be coming my way had I remained an attorney. On a very practical basis, I will never be rich but will probably never have to worry about beng unemployed. It allows me time to enjoy my family and my interests. I can’t imagine any better way to make a living.
Yes, there are nurses who are rude, abrupt, uncaring and even downright sadistic. I can promise you that they weren’t that way when they started nursing school. Ask yourself what happened to them to make them that way, and how the health care system can be fixed so that nurses can practice the way they were taught in school.
It breaks my heart, that with the acknowledged shortage of skilled RNs, new grads are having trouble finding that first job. It also worries methat the average staff nurse probably has a better understanding of how the health care system does and doesn’t work than most of the policy wonks (and I was one) in Washington. Listen to the grunts in the trenches. Help us do what we were trained to do, and the Nurse Ratchett’s of the world will become just an urban legend. I have been a nurse for 30 years, started as an LPN, BSN, Masters in Nursing, and a law degree. After law school I did not want to be an attorney, it was not satisfying to me, I remained a nurse.  I have taught nursing at the AD level and the BSN level. I love nursing, it is a wonderful profession, I have never talked down about the profession.  And it is a profession and it is a wonderful career, so many different things can be done with a nursing degree. In the hospital, the community, the government, insurance, not for profit etc. I would encourage anyone to become a nurse, but you have to be in it for the right reasons, you have to care about people, not be in it for the money or salary  You have to want to help people but at the same time learn to disassociate so that you can get them to the next step in their health care regime.  It is physically hard, mentally stimulating, emotionally draining job and then some. I was a lucky person from early on and always knew I wanted to be a nurse, and if I could live my life over,  I would not change professions, I would still choose to become a nurse.
                                                                                          — CJH I’m glad that Theresa Brown was able to act on her realization that she wanted to be a nurse.   I’m a 63-yr-old nurse;  About 10 years ago I realized that I have always wanted to be an actress.  (Why else do I practice scenes in the bathroom mirror, wear “costumes”, and change my persona with my patients?)   Although I haven’t hated nursing, I have that sad, sinking feeling whenever I watch great actresses work.  Ah that I could have switched careers so easily!!

FROM TPP — Hey, you never know! Maybe you should check out your local theater opportunities just for fun. I love the idea that you change your persona with your patients. Tell us more. Like clockwork each year the state teachers union fires up the drubbing for better pay and benefits.  Already starting teachers make more money and enjoy far better benefits than any new RN.  But the teachers whine about their poor pay, the stress of their job, etc…  I have yet to find any teacher who would leave the classroom for healthcare.  It is nice to read that some will actually do that. Jack –
I’m an editor at a successful national magazine – the type of job that is often glamorized on television (Ugly Betty) and in movies (The Devil Wears Prada, 13 going on 30, Confessions of a Shopaholic, just to name a few). I’m making plans to leave this exciting, glamorous job to start over and become a nurse.  Sometimes, these choices have nothing to do with wanting glamour, and everything to do with wanting to feel like you’ve actually done something good with your life. I already work long hours. Once I’m done with school, maybe all that hard work will actually mean something. In response to Jane: With your attitude, I don’t have difficulty seeing how anyone could be put in an off mood.  Not all nurses are hero’s but without them you wouldn’t be here today.  If you had an issue with the nurses that worked with you, I hope you stood up for yourself, we cannot learn if you do not tell us when you are unhappy.  We are people too. Interesting article, mainly in connection with `successful, radical midlife career change’. I can easily see somebody getting `professor burnout’ (you interact almost exclusively with passive, worried, powerless listeners, not colleagues, or even young inquisitive minds). Incidentally, there are commonalities between the relationships professor/student and nurse/patient that are intriguing here. On the other hand, I can also see getting (after say, 20 years) anything-burnout. Teacher, engineer, lawyer, nurse, manager, newspaper columnist… professions are such confining, eventually stultifying environments, any profession. (How many nurses out there dreaming of work as teachers or professors?) Tough luck- after a certain age (say, 45) everyone becomes unemployable. We need to reorganize society so that this is no longer the case. To No. 1:
Weren’t the main characters in 3rd Rock from the Sun college professors? Maybe not English professors. But they worked at a college. Just to answer your somewhat rhetorical question. I loved this article. My mother worked as an R.N. and she always loved the profession. I’ve encountered many wonderful nurses during the various health travails of my now-elderly parents over the past several years. The tiny minority are of the Nurse Ratchet variety. Far more common are the caring, professional, smart, dedicated sort who work very very hard. Maybe it’s a Nebraska thing. Awesome!
A good nurse is worth her weight in gold.
As a doctor I always listen whenever a nurse speaks up. To ignore the most important caregiver of a patient is to endanger patient safety and court malpractice.
And I just don’t understand why the USA does not plan for andgraduate enough nurses and doctors to take care of our population.
Instead, we import 25-50% of new nurses and doctors and contribute to braindrain all around the world.
A society such as ours should be EXPORTING nurses and doctors and their expertise. Why is it that Cuba has to take up the slack of providing doctors around the world. After Katrina, we could have used those 1000 doctors that Cuba pledged, as doctors took their practices elsewhere. Something is really wrong with this equation, and I hope the writer will next shed some light on this situation with her next opportunity. But I salute her choices! I have worked for Members of Congress, in Public Affairs for nonprofit health organizations, and also been a stay at home mom/school volunteer/Girl Scout leader.  Five years ago, I went back to school and will soon take my state licensing exam to be an RN.  I hope to have twenty more years to work and am looking forward to being able to be of service in yet another way.  I see all the problems in our health care system, but it is the patients that make the job worthwhile.  They each have their own special story, and it is a challenge to decide how I can best meet their individual needs.   I consider it an honor to have the chance, and I wish that more people – men and women – would consider nursing when they think about a mid-life career change. This is a lovely article about the rewards of nursing, but I would just like to say that teacher/professors can care and nurture students and not simply grade and judge. I have taught college since 1992, first at St. John’s University in NYC and now at North Seattle Community College. My priority is to encourage my students and open doors they didn’t even know were there. I love this job. Grading is stressful but I always look at it as giving a student a realistic take on where they are and where they are going and point out what they are doing right in addition to areas that need to improve and ultimately succeed.  Those of us who work must “make the grade”. How do we prepare our students for life if we aren’t willing to give them feedback and let them know that they will encounter standards and expectations not just in school but in the world? As the experts in the situation, it is part of our responsibility to do this fairly and well. Only seeing grading as a negative process and not part preparation for life is perhaps one reason why grade inflation is so rampant and why students expect an A for meeting minimum course requirements.  Teach with compassion and high standards, grade fairly, this is our job. As the editor of the Journal of Nursing Jocularity, a publication aimed at therapeutic humor both by and for nurses, I applaud Theresa’s decision — and her ability to explain her reasoning so eloquently.   Nursing, as a profession, is now facing more challenges than ever  before.  The number and needs of patients are rising while resources are dwindling.   Having people like Theresa choosing nursing as a second career is a very positive trend, bringing a fresh energy and perspective to the field. “I was expected to care about people, not grade or judge them.” I don’t see how the two clauses are mutually exclusive. Surely grading and judging students can be a form of caring: investing enough in a student to want to make them aware of where they stand, so that they can get better, makes teaching a vocation as much as nursing, and both have their perks and pitfalls. The logical leap from the premise of personal burnout to concluding that teaching=bad, nursing=good requires a bit too much faith in this case.
