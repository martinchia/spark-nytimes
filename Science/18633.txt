Bean salads are a great choice for summer picnics, and most recipes can easily be adapted to accommodate any vegans in the crowd. This week the Recipes for Health columnist Martha Rose Shulman turns to summer bean salads: As the weather heats up and our hunger for comforting stews gives way to a desire for lighter fare, beans can still be the backbone of a meal, but Iâm more inclined to make them the focus of a main dish salad than a simmering ragout. I love the way they soak up tart salad dressings and the way their velvety textures play against the crunch of other salad ingredients, like fresh green beans, celery or fennel.  Here are five new ways to prepare bean salads. Black-Eyed Pea Salad With Fennel and Dill: A great dish that can be made with or without tomatoes.  Lentil Salad With Fresh Favas: This antioxidant-rich dish gets a kick from a tart cumin-scented dressing. Red Bean, Herb and Walnut Salad: This Georgian-inspired dish can be made a day ahead. Red Bean and Green Bean Salad: Whether you use dried or canned red beans, copious herbs and bright green beans add a fresh note. Fava Bean and Asparagus Salad: Thick asparagus spears are best for this flavorful, intensely green salad. Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
