While waiting out Hurricane Sandy, my daughter and I resorted to mindless snacking. Maybe it was the worry of not knowing what was to come, or the chill in the air as the first rains smacked at our windows, but we sought comfort in food, munching on chips and guacamole, cheese and crackers, grapes and cookies, as we waited for the storm to hit. After posting a note about hurricane snacking on my Facebook page, my friends chimed in that they, too, were enjoying their own hurricane binges. “I’m cooking up a huge chili,” said my friend Roxanne. “Pulled pork here,” said Donna. “So far today I’ve made: pancakes, Chicken Divan, my Nana’s meatball stew, Rice Krispie treats and now I’m bugging (my daughter) to make chocolate chip cookies!” posted Traci. “If the power goes out, we will be forced to eat all the ice cream in the freezer,” said Lynn. This online discussion about food, later followed on my cellphone when the power went out, gave me a feeling of connectedness to others who were weathering the same storm. How about you?
