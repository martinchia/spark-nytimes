 Monkeys can recognize an object they have seen before, but now scientists have shown that they are also capable of a much more sophisticated form of memory: They can hold in mind an object without actually seeing it. Recall is a routine part of human mental activity. It is what allows us, for example, to describe a person who is not present. But without language, animals have not been able to tell a researcher whether they recall something. Now a study published on Thursday in Current Biology suggests that language is not necessary — either for having the ability to recall, or for proving it to an experimenter. Researchers trained five rhesus monkeys. On a 5-by-5-inch grid on a computer screen, the monkeys were shown a shape consisting of three adjacent squares, one blue and two red in various patterns. Advertisement After a moment, the red squares disappear, and the blue square moves to a different box on the grid. After another delay, the monkey has to restore the red squares to their original places in relation to the blue one by pressing on the correct boxes of the grid. When he does so successfully, he gets a food reward. Advertisement All the monkeys performed the task with a success rate significantly above chance. In other words, they could recall the positions of the squares without seeing them. The lead author, Benjamin M. Basile, a graduate student in psychology at Emory University, said that there may be aspects of memory previously testable only with language that are universal to primates. “We just need to find ways to get at them,” he said.
