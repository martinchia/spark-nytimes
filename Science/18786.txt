   Getting parents to take sore throats more seriously and treating them more aggressively with penicillin could save thousands of lives in poor countries relatively cheaply, doctors from India and South Africa say. Strep throat caused by Group A streptococcus bacteria can lead to rheumatic heart disease, in which antibodies produced by the immune system also attack the heart muscle and the joints. The name comes from the joint problem, which resembles rheumatism, but the most dangerous consequence is the deformation of heart valves. The authors of a recent paper in the journal Global Heart estimate that a quarter of all sore throats are caused by strep A bacteria and that such infections lead to as many as 500,000 deaths a year, almost all of them in poor countries. Strep tests available in these countries usually take too much time, requiring days to observe the growth of bacteria. The heart-valve damage is also hard to diagnose; a stethoscope catches only 10 percent of the cases that echocardiograms do. One penicillin shot within nine days of infection usually prevents any heart damage. Cuba, Costa Rica and Martinique have sharply reduced rheumatic fever by public education about sore throat, screening for strep by symptoms, and treating quickly. The authors suggest that other countries consider following their example.  DONALD G.
