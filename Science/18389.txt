 About half a mile below the surface of the Pacific Ocean, small squid and octopuses face a camouflage conundrum. Some of their predators, like hatchet fish, hunt by diving deeper and looking upward for silhouettes of potential food. To sneak past them, it helps to be transparent and avoid casting a shadow. But other predators, like deep-sea dragonfish, patrol using biological searchlights that reflect off of clear flesh, like a flashlight pointed at a window. In the presence of these luminescent adversaries, it’s much safer to be as dark as the surrounding water.   New research shows that at least two species of cephalopod — a Japetella octopus and an Onychoteuthis squid — have avoided this dilemma by evolving the ability to switch rapidly between the two disguises. “In less than a second, it’s on and off,” said Sarah Zylinski, an ecologist at Duke University and an author of the study, which appeared in Current Biology. To alternate camouflage, the two cephalopods rely on distributed sacs of black pigment, which they can twitch like muscles. When it’s dark and the cephalopods want to be transparent, the sacs form compact spheres, allowing the animals’ glassy flesh to show. But when a light appears, the sacs flatten and stretch toward one another, shrouding the creatures in pigment.
