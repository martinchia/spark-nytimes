The ritual of drinking 21 or more alcoholic beverages to celebrate the 21st birthday appears to be far more common than expected, according to new research. It’s estimated that more than four out of every five American 21-year-olds drink alcohol to celebrate the birthday milestone, which is the the legal drinking age in the United States. But a new study from University of Missouri researchers of 2,518 students shows that many young adults aren’t just drinking to celebrate — they are drinking to extremes. Among those students who drank alcohol to celebrate their 21st birthdays, 34 percent of the men and 24 percent of the women reported consuming 21 or more drinks, according to the research to be published in The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology. The report is believed to be the largest study of the “21 at 21″ drinking ritual, which often involves shots of alcohol. The students in the study were followed for four years and asked a variety of questions about their drinking behavior over the course of their college years. Although the findings likely can’t be applied to the general population, the data likely reflect the drinking culture at large, public universities, researchers said. Based on the data, researchers estimated that half of the men and more than a third of the women who drank on their birthdays experienced blood alcohol levels of 0.26 or higher, the level at which a person is severely impaired and at risk for choking on vomit or suffering serious injury. While researchers say its possible some students overstated how much they actually drank, the consistency of the answers suggests students are consuming large quantities of alcohol when they celebrate a 21st birthday. “I think a lot of people view this as a feel-good rite of passage and don’t calibrate what a big risk it is,” said Kenneth Sher, professor of psychological sciences at the University of Missouri-Columbia and the study’s lead author. Alcohol researchers have been searching for ways to curb the extreme drinking common on the 21st birthday. One concern is that interest in the ritual appears to be spreading because drinkers who attempt or succeed at downing 21 drinks post videos and photos of the drinking binges on YouTube or Flickr or social networking sites like MySpace. One of the biggest worries about the ritual is alcohol poisoning. The body’s ability to metabolize alcohol depends on several factors, including gender, weight, the type of alcohol, whether the person vomits during the binge and the time period during which the alcohol is consumed. But in some cases, as few as 10 drinks can push blood alcohol levels to 0.30, the point at which the respiratory system slows enough that death is possible. That appears to be what happened to Jesse Drews, a 21-year-old Fox Lake, Wis., resident who died on March 24, his 21st birthday. Although the death is still under investigation, it’s believed he may have attempted to drink 21 shots to celebrate at a Waupun, Wis., tavern. A friend who brought him home said he had “10 or 12 shots,” although his parents have since been told different stories about how much alcohol was consumed. What is known is that his family found him unresponsive at 4 a.m., and a hospital test showed a blood alcohol level of 0.38, according to his family and the Dodge County Sheriff’s Office. Waupun police chief Dale Heeringa said he couldn’t comment on the details of the investigation until the medical examiner’s report is finished. He said Mr. Drews did not finish 21 shots, although he did consume “a significant amount of alcohol.” Jesse’s mother, Jody Drews, said her son had been reluctant to go out that night but relented after friends persuaded him. He returned home around 1:15 a.m. and went to bed, and Mrs. Drews checked on him throughout the night, including around 3:30 a.m., when she heard him snoring and returned to bed.  “I never in a million years thought we would be in this situation,” Mrs. Drews said. “Kids have to know about this risk. I hope anybody who goes into a bar and sees this happening will say something.” Clayton Neighbors, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington Center for the Study of Health and Risk Behaviors in Seattle, is studying Internet-based interventions he hopes will convince more young people to moderate their drinking on their 21st birthdays. In one study of 316 students, to be presented at the American Psychological Association conference this year, those who were given Web-based information about drinking prior to their 21st birthday drank less than students who didn’t receive the information.  Students in the intervention group were asked how much they planned to drink on their 21st birthday and how common they believed extreme drinking really is. The interactive tool then showed them that only a minority of students drink 21 or more drinks. It also calculated a student’s blood alcohol level based on the amount he or she planned to drink. Giving students extra information about drinking appeared to result in blood alcohol levels that were about 25 percent lower than the group that wasn’t given the information, he said. “One of the problems is a lot of these kids don’t realize that 21 drinks in an hour can kill you,” Dr. Neighbors said. One group, Be Responsible About Drinking (B.R.A.D.), was started by family and friends of Michigan State University student Bradley McCue, who died from extreme drinking on his 21st birthday. The group sends out birthday cards prior to the 21st birthday warning people about the dangers of alcohol poisoning. The site also includes numerous charts showing how various numbers of drinks affect blood alcohol levels. And to see how alcohol affects you, based on standard height and weight charts, use this calculator. For a more detailed look at the 21st birthday drinking binge, see this earlier story by my colleague Kate Zernike at The Times. Comments are no longer being accepted. When I turned 21, I went out to eat with my family and ate a big dinner.  I had a beer with dinner then went to a part.  I had a beer and a half and then was way too full to drink anymore.  So if you can be with your child on their birthday, take them to a big dinner, with appetizers and desserts.  It might help. The New Cook I learned about this story on “The Today Show.”  I’m sorry, but if this young man didn’t have the sense to not get drunk, then his mother shouldn’t be on TV blaming the bartender, the bar patrons, and his friends who took him to the bar!  I hope that parents who read this story will use it as an opportunity to teach their children about being responsibility and accepting the consequences of their behavior. From TPP — I think her point was that there were so many missed opportunities to stop this tragedy, and people along the way who could have made a difference had they been aware of the problem. The reason Jody Drews went on television was alert other parents in hope they would use it as an opportunity to reach out to their kids, and I think she was very brave in doing so.  God, but I just hate alcohol! Binge drinking, including rituals, is the tip or the iceberg.  Considering our “free market”, young (and old) should be aware of certain FACTS, then make their own decision and live with consequences. These FACTS include: (1) Regardless of the amount consumed, the liver will metabolize (break down) only a finite amount per hour, then blood alcohol increases; (2) For the same amount consumed, women are more susceptible to alcoholic liver disease, heart disease, muscle damage, and brain damage; (3) Whether a person considers himself/herself to be a moderate or heavy drinker, the “process of metabolism” will happen and has certain effects.  In women, it increases the level of a certain estrogen (which has been associated with breast cancer).  In men, it impairs the production of testosterone and sperm and can lead to feminization (such as breast growth).  (4) Studies show that, as the number of daily drinks increases, the risk for oral cancers (esophagus, etc.) increases. Young people and older people have choices to make.  They can play the “rational ignorance” card and “buy into” the marketing theme that women should drink a few glasses of wine daily to reduce the risk of heart disease.  They can also “buy into” all of the latest drinking games, rituals, etc. OR they can accept the previously mentioned FACTS (which are easily verifiable) and drink responsibly or not at all.  This is, afterall, a “free market”.  HOWEVER, it should be remembered that there’s no such thing as a “free lunch”. Don’t mean to sound inconsiderate but we must remember these are adults now and should be allowed to make stupid decisions. I would hate to see the government intervene and distort our free choices to protect some delinquents from themselves. Perhaps the “drinking age” should be lowered back to 18, then they’d only try to consume 18 drinks instead of 21! I warned my young cousin before he went off to college about the tradition of drinking 21 drinks on your 21st birthday.  It’ll put you way over the lethal dose of alcohol poisoning. Your calculator said I’d be at twice the lethal dose if I tried drinking 21 shots in an hour. It’s days like today when I just have to stop and be thankful I didn’t get myself killed in college. This is a tragic story and one that happens far too often and comes close to happening enough to make any parent shudder.  I’m 23 now, and I’ve learned to have a glass of wine with dinner and be content. Two short years ago, I tried to do 21-on-21 with the full support of all my friends. I still have the picture of my arm signed 21 times by all the people who bought me drinks. Lucky for me, the bar we chose was stingy with alcohol and most of my drinks contained less than a half a shot. Still I managed to throw up halfway through the night and “rally” by going right back out to keep drinking.  This night was not an anomaly in my college drinking experience. I made some bad choices, but I think it’s important for parents to be aware that many colleges today have a culture of binge drinking that goes beyond being young and stupid.  I was a serious student — graduating with a 3.9 GPA from a prestigious liberal arts college before going on to medical school. But looking back on how I spent those four years and how many times I encouraged a friend to have “just one more drink” I can’t help but feel like I was part of all that is wrong with college culture these days. In response to Vikki: I don’t know what sort of laws exist in Wisconsin, but i know in many states it’s illegal for a bartender to serve drinks to a visibly intoxicated person.  Odd, I know, but true–so the mother may have a legal right to be blaming the bar and the bartender. I work as a substance abuse prevention specialist, and I’ve been surprised at the number of young people I encounter who don’t know that you can die from excessive alcohol consumption.  It’s scary. Stop calling 21 year olds “kids.”
seriously.
They are working men and women, they are working for college degrees, they are living independently of their parents, they are dying in Iraq for this country..
The biggest problem is not “that these kids don’t know 21 drinks in an hour might kill them.”
The problem lies much, much deeper. The drinking laws in America are ridiculous and lure young teenagers to the product. Because alcohol is illegal until way after “kids” begin experimenting with it, they are forced to go underground, where the habits of binge drinking develop.
Protect THESE kids, take them out for appetizers and a beer. Take away the allure of an “illegal” yet socially acceptable substance. Mrs. Drews wasn’t blaming anyone – she was simply informing people watching (whether it be a bartender, future bar patron, friend of a person celebrating his or her 21st, etc.) that one shouldn’t be afraid to step in and say “Ok, that’s enough”.  It would be nice to say that no one goes out and gets drunk on their 21st birthday – but as we all know, that isn’t the case. Instead of criticizing, we should be educating.  It took a lot of courage for Mrs. Drews to get on television and talk about her son’s death – and we can only pray that lives will be saved in the future because of her bravery in speaking out about the loss of Jesse. Rest in Peace Jesse “Weiner” Drews. Vikki-
I think itâs pretty rude that you are saying that Jody is blaming someone for her son dying.  That is definitely not the case.  In Wisconsin all of us kids drink with our parents until we are 21.  That is just how it goes in Wisconsin and anyone who lives in this state can tell you that.  Drinking was never and issue for Jesse.  So in a sense, doing a couple more shots than usual was probably not a big deal to him.  I think that your opinion of what happened would be quite different if you were at the funeral and actually knew Jesse.  I went to high school with Jesse.  All of the kids in our class would always get together and party.  If you think that we not educated about drinking, you are very mistaken.  This is just an extremely tragic accident and you blaming his parents for not educating him about drinking is WRONG.  On my 21st birthday I didnât think twice about doing shots.  You just donât think that something like this could happen to youâ¦ tragically it did hit home for all of us in Waupun.  Think about what you say before you blame parents for not educating their children.  Jody is just trying to warn other parents about this so it wonât happen to someone else. This kind of birthday binging tends to happen more often in countries with a strict minimum age to purchase alcohol. Many European countries with more flexible laws, notably Spain and France, don’t have this problem to the same extent. Also, I find it a little silly that on the blood-alcohol content calculator, you can select several specific cocktails, but there is no option for wine.

From TPP — Do a google search on blood alcohol content calculators and you will find others that list wine. However, it’s tough to find a calculator that will go as high as 21 drinks. Most will only go to 9 or 10 and if you put more than that in, it will give you a message saying “that is not a reasonable amount.” This is why the country needs to lower the drinking age.
If you learn HOW to drink at a younger age, then you won’t binge at 21.
You need to learn your limit and be done with it.
This is why college is so dangerous. Jesse was my best friend…Nobody ever thought drinking would be a problem for him…he was a normal 21 year old that went out for his 21st birthday…i know he didnt want to go out that night but Jesse was the kind of guy who just always wanted to have fun I know he didnt see any harm in going out…So he said yes to going out with a couple of friends…Jesse was always the life of the party…he made everyone laugh and he made sure everyone was having a good time!  Jesse lived his life to the fullest he did what he loved and he loved what he did! JESSE M DREWS YOU WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN!  You and your family are in my thoughts and prayers!!! I like the point that a 21-year-old is not a kid. “Childhood” as we know it was invented about 100 years ago. Since then, people have been trying to stay in that category longer and longer — living off their parents, acting like babies. After you pass puberty you are an adult. The “college experience” has contributed to the prolonging of the childhood mentality. People need to suck it up and act like a productive member of society. Also, it is a myth that alcohol-related deaths/injuries don’t happen in European countries. It lived in Italy — drunk driving is a HUGE issue. I think Americans of a certain persuasion just like to make these ideas up — that in Europe all these issues just don’t exist. I do think that the 21 age threshold is part of the problem. Infantilising adults is a sure way to get them to behave like idiots. Yes there will always be people who do stupid things when they hit the legal drinking age but the younger it is the more likely there is to be parental influence and control.  Trying to control a 21 year olds drinking is like trying to stop 25 year olds from having sex – pointless and counterproductive. Make a big deal out of banning alcohol for adults (ie over 18s) and you create a culture where they have to prove themselves when they reach the magic age of 21. I’m not saying countries with 18 as the legal age have no problems with binge drinking – but I do think it is easier to control 18 year olds. For a start they are still probationary drivers so you can impose a zero blood alcohol limit and take their license at the first DUI offence. That’s a big disincentive and losing their licence prevents them from killing people. Of course you also need random breath testing to be done often and strategically placed. I am surprised at the lack of general knowledge amongst young Americans about blood alcohol content and the basic calculations. Gadgets are fine but the general rule is 1 standard drink per hour for men, 1 standard drink in the first 2 hours for women, 1 per hour after that. The occasional maximum of 6 standard drinks for men and 4 for women should also be a guide. I’ve specified that I want only a standard drink and people have asked “what’s that?”.  1 shot of spirits
2 shots of fortified wine
100ml wine
1 can of midstrength beer
middy of full strength beer In Australia most pubs, restaurants and nightclubs will serve their drinks in standard-drink form (if you order a cocktail you need to count the shots). Also there is a lot of ignorance about the effect of alcohol – perhaps because random breath testing isn’t done in a lot of states. People still think that if you feel ok you’re not affected by the alcohol – how you feel is nearly irrelevant. If you have a blood alcohol reading of .05% you are impaired whether you’re slurring and stumbling or not (and most of us won’t be at that point). To prove you’re not impaired try responding to an emergency stopping situation in a car – its been measured, you will have a longer reaction time even if you feel fine. I came of age back in the 70’s when 18 was the “legal” age for drinking.  But I didn’t start drinking when I was 18.  My parents had always offered me wine during a Seder or the Jewish New Year when we would normally have some as part of the celebration.  And they never gave me a full glass of it.  It was always watered down until I was about 14 or so.  If I wanted a sip of my father’s beer or scotch I was allowed to try it.  I discovered that I didn’t care for beer but that I did like scotch.  The same went for mixed drinks.  They would make me one mixed drink if I asked and they were having a party.  That one drink had to last me the entire night.  I was not given seconds until I was older.  In fact it was clear to me by their actions that drinking was part of life but life was not drinking.   When I was in college I saw many students drink themselves sick every weekend.  I see this now with high school students.  Many parents don’t allow them to drink at all.  What do they do:  go to parks that have hidden places to drink where, if something happens no one will find them.  If we taught children how to walk the way we teach them how to drink most children would wind up not walking.  Drinking is a social activity and should be taught as such. Actually, I’m turning 21 in just a week.  My friends have huge plans for my birthday, but as I have a French exam the next day, I am only going to have 2 drinks and dinner with my brother, boyfriend and 1 friend.  That weekend, my girlfriends still want to take me out and get me ‘hammered,’ but I dont’ like the sound of that.  Even though it may not be my choice to get extremely drunk, my friends will still try to persuade me to do it.  I’m glad that of all the information I’ve collected through college, one has been to stand up for myself and say ‘no’ even when everyone else is trying to get me to do it their way. From TPP — Maybe you can convince your friends to pool their money and buy a few great bottles of champagne and caviar and share a single quality toast with your friends. Or try some other indulgence or feat — a 21 minute massage, make all your friends do 21 pushups, take one bite out of 21 different pieces of chocolate, eat 21 pieces of sushi or taste 21 desserts, kiss 21 cute boys, do 21 good deeds and take a Polaroid to capture each one…– there are so many fun ideas to mark that day that don’t involve excessive alcohol and the great thing is you will remember every minute of your 21st birthday. Happy Birthday.  I am a parent who DID go out with my kids (twins) to celebrate their 21st birthday, primarliy to be their designated driver. Both of them started out with a dinner and started with just a couple of drinks.  We ended up at a bar with a bunch of their friends who started my daughter on her “21 for 21″ shots.  Funny – my son’s friends didn’t even attempt this with him.  I tried to stop this as the shots were coming one right after another but the bartender (the only one serving that end of the bar) just kept pouring the shots and finally i had to tell him & her “friends” NO MORE!.  I didn’t realize until she went from standing upright to limp noodle that she had 13 marks on her hand which indicated the number of shots she had consumed.  These were served to her in a matter of less than 2 hours.  I did not realize she had had that many and i was there.  Needless to say, i took her home, stayed up with her during the night, making sure she was breathing & not choking on her vomit.  I actually thought about taking directly to the hospital instead of home.  She did recover – albeit with a hang-over. I feel the blame SHOULD be on the bartenders that knowingly serve large quantities of alcohol to ANYONE in a small amount of time (not sure 21 shots in a 24 hours period is even safe).  The bartender has the right to NOT SERVE someone who looks to be impaired.  This is taught in Bartenders school in the state of WIsconsin.  You have to take this class to get a bartender’s license.  I firmly believe that the bartender who had that right could have said NO to Jesse and his friends but decided to set up the 21 shots instead.   If one life is saved from his mother’s interview this morning, it was well worth her going on air. Stupid is as stupid does. I think that part of the problem is that, by the time you get to four or five shots, whatever information you had about what a bad idea 21 shots would be might have gone out the window with your sobriety.   I’d had perhaps 10 drinks total in the 20 years before my 21st birthday, so when I went out on my birthday, I got very drunk, very fast.  I have a vague memory of a bartender dousing my hand with Bacardi 151 and then setting it on fire â the “Statue of Liberty,” I understand.  Obviously, stupid thing for me to do, and I can’t imagine I would have allowed it if I hadn’t already had several drinks.  But â¦ it was my stupid choice, and any unfortunate effects would have been my stupid fault. FROM TPP _- I think you make a really good point. Yes we choose to drink but at some point our judgment is impaired. That’s why it’s important that friends, bartenders and patrons all are aware of the risks. If I ever saw this happening in a bar I would intervene, telling the kids, the friends, the bartender everyone…because unfortunately the drinker, after a few shots, no longer has the capacity to make an informed choice. And if you watch the videos of these celebrations on YouTube and elsewhere, you will see that the drinker is ALWAYS encouraged with shouts and cheers to keep going even when his/her body is saying stop.  I agree with henry. I am a 29-year American, and moved to Europe when I was 18. I ended up spending 4 years there. In the US, legally I still had 3 more years until I was able to drink. But over there, I casually drank with my European friends. There were no  binge drinking, no getting smashed until you are sick. You just went to the Pub, had a couple of beers and then went home when it closed at 11PM! It was what everyone did, young or old. It was too much hassle to  go to the city if you wanted to go clubbing- only a handful did that. Then when I came back to the US to visit my parents during my breaks, my American friends seemed so immature. It seemed like all they wanted to do was go to parties and get drunk-still. Like we were still in high school. There is something to be said about the way Europe’s drinking age is 16-18 instead of 21. Its almost as if they are forced to grow up faster. I tried the BAC calculator.  If I drank 21 shots I’d probably be dead.  Bleah. Like hen3ry, I was drinking with my family before I was ‘drinking age’.  A small glass of wine, a sip of what my parents were drinking, that sort of thing.  I grew up and went off to college, where I was the designated driver more often than not for my friends’ binge drinking. For my 21st, I went out and bought a few bottles of wine and some margarita supplies.  I invited a bunch of my friends over, and we had margaritas and then a nice dinner with the wine.  No one got drunk; it was a convivial evening spent with friends and good food.  It reflected my upbringing and attitudes towards drinking overall. I’m in my mid-30’s now, and can count the number of times I’ve been drunk on one hand.  I have a glass of wine or two with dinner fairly often, and I enjoy scotch and bourbon and the occasional margarita, but there’s no real reason to lose control of my intake to the point of inebriation. Alcohol can and should be enjoyed responsibly.  There is nothing good about binge drinking.  It’s got all sorts of health negatives and severely impairs judgment.
