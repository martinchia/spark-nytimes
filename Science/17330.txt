 A new set of computer simulations, described in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, projects that a major undersea earthquake, considered inevitable in the next few decades off Sumatra, poses a substantial flooding threat to two coastal cities. The destructive potential of the tsunamis will all depend on how the earthquake shifts the sea bed. The simulations shown here were done with a scenario in which the fault beneath the seabed (map) shifts 20 meters over a 500-mile-long stretch -- something of a worst case, but not out of the question given the seismic history of the region. Destructive tsunamis struck after strong offshore earthquakes in 1797 and 1833. Padang, with a population of 800,000, could be somewhat shielded by a chain of islands situated along the fault, the Sunda megathrust, but still might see wave heights of 15 feet. (Click here for the animation as a .mov file.) Bengkulu, with about 350,000 people, has no islands offshore and so is likely to receive the full force of the tsunami, with wave heights possibly greater than 20 feet repeatedly sweeping inland over a two-hour period.
