 To the Editor: In her article “Finally the Spleen Gets Some Respect”(Basics, Aug. 4), Natalie Angier neglects to mention a possible destructive role of the monocytes residing in the spleen. When a person exhibits a condition of having a lower than safe platelet count of no known cause, these monocytes mobilize themselves to destroy the platelets as soon as they are manufactured in the bone marrow. They are like a robotic standing army that is instructed to shoot at any intruder regardless whether the latter is a friend or an enemy. Since splenectomy, or removal of the spleen, has been used to treat this condition for almost a century, it is puzzling why medical researchers are only now discovering the massive number of on-call monocytes camping out in the spleen. Fu-Tin Man Mechanicsburg, Penn.  To the Editor: As a retired pediatrician I was upset to read that if a spleen ruptures, “you have to remove it.” During the latter years of my practice it was found that many ruptured spleens did not have to be removed but could be saved by careful watchful waiting. A healed spleen is thus saved to perform its remarkable functions. Fred Pipkin, M.D. Coxs Creek, Ky. A version of this letter appears in print on , on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: An Organ Gets Its Due.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
