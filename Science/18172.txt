 The avian flu situation in Indonesia is grave, and the risk of mutation into a human pandemic form will worsen if more is not done, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization warned last week. “The human mortality rate from bird flu in Indonesia is the highest in the world,” said Dr. Joseph Domenech, the agency’s chief veterinary officer, “and there will be more human cases if we do not focus more on containing the disease at its source in animals.” Indonesia is failing to contain its poultry epidemic, Dr. Domenech said. He blamed decentralized government, a shortage of veterinarians, indifference by commercial producers, a lack of political commitment and the fact that 30 million Indonesians raise backyard chickens. Indonesia has confirmed 129 cases of H5N1 flu, of which 105 were fatal, according to the World Health Organization. The only other countries reporting human cases thus far this year are China, Egypt and Vietnam. Health authorities are also worried, however, about poultry outbreaks in Bangladesh and India. This month, Bangladesh reported culling at more than 400 farms. Across the border in the West Bengal state of India, the government claimed to have wiped out its outbreak, then found new cases. Since the disease was found in crows, it presumably crosses borders there easily. Dr. Domenech also noted that new H5N1 strains were evolving in Indonesia, possibly rendering current poultry vaccines useless. In Egypt, newly emerging strains found even in vaccinated flocks suggest that bad vaccine matches are speeding mutations.
