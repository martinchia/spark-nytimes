 To the Editor: Re “Uncovering the Mystery of the Worm Charmer” (Observatory, Oct 21): Your article about “worm grunting” struck a responsive chord for me. I was taught this art about 65 years ago by my father-in-law in Reynolds, Ga., before a small audience of relatives who stood around and jeered. We used two planks, but the worms didn’t know the difference, and it was astonishing to see them come hurrying out of the ground when the vibrations began. It is an easy way to get bait for fishing in the local ponds. I don’t think I will ever again indulge in this “sport.” I am 97 years old, and my grunting days are over. A. F.
