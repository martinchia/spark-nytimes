 Thanks in large part to effective vaccines, rates of hepatitis A and hepatitis B infection have declined to their lowest levels in 40 years, according to data published recently  by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Incidence of hepatitis C, for which there is no vaccine, has also declined substantially. Vaccination for hepatitis A has been recommended by the C.D.C. since 1996 for international travelers and men who have sex with men, and since 1999 for children living in communities with the highest rates of the disease. The 2005 rate, the latest for which complete data is available, was 1.5 per 100,000, down from 12 per 100,000 in 1995. The agency now recommends universal hepatitis B vaccination of infants, children and adolescents; screening of pregnant women; and vaccination for adults at increased risk for infection. In 2005, the hepatitis B rate was 1.8 cases per 100,000, the lowest recorded since surveillance began in 1966 and an 80 percent decline since 1991. Hepatitis B can be contracted only through exposure to infected blood or body fluids. “We’re doing a good job at preventing new cases,” said Annemarie Wasley, the lead author of the paper and an epidemiologist at the disease centers, “but we still have a large burden of chronic B and C, and we have to reach out to these people to prevent transmission to others and to help them maintain their own health.” The report appears in The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report for March 16. Incidence of hepatitis C has declined 11 percent since 1992, probably because of risk-reduction practices among injection drug users, but about 3.2 million Americans are chronically infected. Hepatitis C is spread through contaminated blood and, inefficiently, through sexual contact.
