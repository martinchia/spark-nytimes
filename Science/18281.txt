 To the Editor: Re “Explain a Medical Error? Sure. Apologize Too?” (Cases, Jan. 1): As a physician, Dr. Sandeep Jauhar did what is ethically proper in apologizing to his patient. And, as a human, it is understandable that he could not bring himself to do this “in the cath lab, while everyone was watching.” But as a teacher within a residency program, he thereby missed a valuable opportunity to model this important behavior openly before his intern patient, physician peers and medical co-workers. Until such candor becomes possible, can the mystique of physician infallibility ever hope to change? John Whelan, M.D.La Crosse, Wis.  To the Editor: I believe Dr. Sandeep Jauhar incorrectly characterizes his decision making as a mistake. It is only through retrospect that his diagnosis was proven incorrect. Dr. Jauhar could have just as easily written about an experience when a serious complication resulted from a test that demonstrated a negative result, questioning the decision to have proceeded with the test. Individual outcomes are just that. Steven Brenner, M.D.Lake Success, N.Y. Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
