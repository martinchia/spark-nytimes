 The active video games played on the Nintendo Wii console may provide more exercise than its Microsoft rival the Xbox 360, a small British study has found, but they are not a substitute for the real thing. Researchers studied six boys and five girls ages 13 to 15, all competent team athletes who played video games at least two hours a week. Using monitoring devices, they measured the children’s energy expenditure at rest and then as they did 15-minute sessions with Project Gotham Racing 3, a sedentary Xbox game, and the active Wii versions of bowling, tennis and boxing. At rest, the children expended an average of about 72 calories per hour. Playing the Xbox game increased the average to 107. Wii tennis consumed 179 calories per hour, and Wii boxing 174 — both significant increases over the Xbox game. But a game of doubles tennis in the real world used 318 calories per hour, and punching a boxing bag 382. The study, which was financed by Cake Media, then the British public relations consultant for Nintendo, appears in the Dec. 22 issue of BMJ. “Wii gaming actually turns over more energy than sedentary gaming, but not as much as authentic sports,” said Gareth Stratton, a co-author of the study and a reader in pediatric exercise science at Liverpool John Moores University. “While it’s not going to replace the real thing, it’s certainly moving in the right direction.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F6 of the New York edition with the headline: Better Than the Couch, But Not Equal to the Court.
