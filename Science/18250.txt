 You were expecting poetry perhaps? The secret messages hidden in scientist J. Craig Venter’s synthetic bacterial genome have now been revealed. They are — his name, and that of his research institute and co-workers. Dr. Venter and colleagues at the J. Craig Venter Institute published a paper last week about the synthesis of the complete DNA of a bacterium. He revealed that the genome had five “watermarks,” sequences of genetic code that would spell words using the letters for the amino acids that would be produced by the DNA. Wired Science reported Monday that it had deciphered the messages, with help from government scientists. One watermark said “VenterInstitvte,” using the unusual spelling because there is no amino acid represented by the letter “u.” The other messages were CraigVenter, HamSmith, GlassandClyde and CindiandClyde. Hamilton O. Smith, Clyde A. Hutchison III, John I. Glass and Cynthia Andrews-Pfannkoch were authors of the synthetic genome paper published on line last week by the journal Science. A spokeswoman for Dr. Venter confirmed the messages. Dr. Venter is not the first to think of burying messages in DNA, which is, after all, an information code. In a paper in Nature Biotechnology in 2003, scientists from Icon Genetics, a German biotechnology company, proposed putting such information into genetically modified crops to help identify and label them. For their demonstration, they did indeed choose a poem, and one in Latin to boot. They engineered Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant commonly used for laboratory experiments, to contain a line from Virgil’s Georgics with the meaning “Neither can every soil bear every fruit.” We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
