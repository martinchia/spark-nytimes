My patient was in her early 20s and a newlywed when she learned she had acute leukemia four years ago. Despite the tsunami of procedures, conversations, medications and emotions that always accompany such a diagnosis, she was a tranquil island, still and serene. âWhat a remarkable attitude she has,â I remember commenting to one of our leukemia nurses at the time. âSheâs very active in her church,â the nurse responded. âShe has a strong faith.â  Religion and medicine can make for awkward bedfellows. While many religions are based on an almighty force that is unseen, thus requiring a core belief in its existence, from the first day of medical school future doctors are taught that abnormalities, or diseases, are confirmed only when they are felt, visualized or heard. Within oncology the saying goes, âTumor is a rumor; tissue is the issue.â A person only receives a cancer diagnosis when a piece of a growth is removed from the body, examined by a pathologist and confirmed to be malignant. We are trained to be empiricists, and as a result we become dubious of what a sense canât experience. I have palpated cancer, seen the havoc it wreaks under a microscope, and auscultated the damage it inflicts on the bodyâs organs. I know itâs there. I canât say the same about God. My patient went into a remission following her first course of chemotherapy and continued her treatment for another two years. Through the headaches, fevers, blood transfusions, bacterial infections, neurological problems, worries that the leukemia had returned, and just sheer exhaustion from the intensity of her therapy, she retained the same poise, equanimity and grace, even buoying the moods of the family who accompanied her to appointments. I once mentioned to her, during an episode of shingles, that she must feel like Job with what she has endured. âIâm fine,â she replied, smiling. âThere are others who are worse off.â  A few months after she completed her therapy, she arrived at an outpatient appointment with two young children in tow. I looked at her, curious, and joked that I hadnât realized she was expecting. She responded with a laugh. âWeâre fostering. Itâs something Iâve always wanted to do.â âThatâs a lot to take on,â I told her. I was worried that she was committing herself to caring for others when she wasnât quite out of the woods with respect to her own health. The leukemia could still return. I think she intuited my concern. âI want to give something back for all of the people who helped me. Iâve prayed about it and Iâll be O.K.,â she reassured me. Another year passed, during which I saw her regularly, and then she came to clinic one day bursting with the news that she was 12 weeks pregnant. We all hugged and celebrated, and I asked to see her every two months to monitor her blood counts.  At her next visit, though, the news wasnât happy. The day before, an ultrasound detected some abnormalities in the fetus that pointed toward a rare congenital syndrome associated with profound retardation and a low likelihood that her child, a boy, would reach the age of 10 years. I asked how she was holding up. âOh, Iâm fine,â she said, as tears started streaming down her face. She kept talking, ignoring them, as if crying had now become a part of her everyday routine. âI mean, the news wasnât good, and they asked to get a sample of the amniotic fluid to confirm the diagnosis, but we told them not to, because we would go through with the pregnancy no matter what.â I nodded, unsurprised she would make that decision. âAre you wondering if the chemotherapy could have caused this?â I asked. âMy husband asked the O.B. that question. She said it wasnât likely, but you know, even if it did, it doesnât matter,â she said. âI had to get the chemo to treat my leukemia, and whatâs done is done. Itâs in the past.â She had stopped crying. âI canât help but think, regardless of what happens, what a lucky baby to have you as a mother.â  She smiled. âItâs really O.K. Weâll love him no matter what. Itâs all part of a greater plan.â She clasped her hands in her lap and her face was placid, the worries from a few moments ago having transformed to a deep calm. It is at moments like these, when I am with people who are at such peace despite the enormous travails they have withstood, that I feel as though I am actually seeing God. With my own two eyes.
