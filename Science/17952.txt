 Q. I have always believed that leaving a tight belt around my waist when my blood pressure is taken is a bad idea. Right? Or not so right? A. “A tight belt compressing your waist, especially if it makes you uncomfortable, will increase your blood pressure,” said Dr. Holly Anderson, cardiologist at the Perelman Heart Institute at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital, but it is far from the only factor that can skew results. Others are the time of day, with the first waking reading usually the highest, as well as temperature, mood, coffee, tobacco and physical activity. “Blood pressures are often taken incorrectly, even by doctors,” Dr. Anderson said. Readings should be taken after a patient has been sitting quietly in a relaxed atmosphere for at least five minutes, “and how often does that happen?” she asked.

When a patient is lying down, readings are generally higher than when sitting or standing. Having your blood pressure taken in a doctor’s office is often stressful, Dr. Anderson said, and readings at the end of the visit are often lower than at the beginning, but repeated high office readings are not normal and suggest that “pressure is likely being elevated too often by other stresses in your life.” Advertisement C.
