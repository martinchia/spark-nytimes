Every time we read or hear about older adults victimized by scams on the phone, scams on the street, thefts in senior residences or attacks via the Internet, we wince. And we think: Is there no way to protect aging parents from such predators, short of taking charge of their finances? Law enforcement has trouble keeping up with these fast-moving thieves, who have often moved onto the next scheme by the time the police and regulators have warned about the current one. And warnings wonât help some potential victims anyway: Poor financial decisions often constitute an early warning sign of cognitive loss, researchers have warned. Yet after decades of adequately handling their own money, older people understandably resist ceding control. Canât we leave them some autonomy — the ability to support a favorite charity or carry some walking-around money or buy a new purse — without the risk that they may impoverish themselves? A thought: The use of prepaid debit cards as a substitute for credit cards and checking accounts has grown enormously in the past few years. A Pew Charitable Trusts survey earlier this month reported that 5 percent of American adults use them at least monthly and that the amount of money loaded onto them — $65 billion in 2012 — has more than doubled over three years. Few card users were over age 65, Pew found — just 5 percent. But maybe more of them could or should be.  Lots of banks, stores and online sources offer prepaid cards, which function much like debit or credit cards but are not linked to bank accounts. You can load and reload them with cash, via direct deposit, or in some cases with transfers or checks deposited at ATMs. People then use them, with either PINs or signatures, to get cash and to shop in person or online. Relying on these cards makes it a lot harder to wipe out an I.R.A. or hand a grifter $10,000. âPrepaid cards can be a useful tool for monitoring and controlling the spending of others,â Christina Tetreault, a staff attorney at Consumers Union, told me. âYou canât spend more money than has been loaded on the card, and that can be very attractive.â In fact, one fledgling company considers older adults such a promising market that it is about to offer a prepaid Visa card, called True Link, specifically intended for seniors. Highly customizable, it will permit the administrator (a trusted family member) to set per-purchase or per-day spending limits or cap A.T.M. withdrawals. It can block charges to individual merchants or charities or whole categories, like magazine subscriptions. You could block only your motherâs phone purchases, for instance. âShe can go to the movies, grocery shopping or out to dinner, and the card works like any debit card,â said James Tinsley, director of marketing and communications at True Link. âBut if sheâs watching late-night television and decides to order four crock pots, the card gets declined.â You could authorize card use at the corner Rite Aid but not the one across town, where she never goes. And you can receive text alerts if someone uses the card to make A.T.M. withdrawals at 2 a.m. Prepaid cards can entail some risks, for seniors or for anyone. Consumer advocates caution that they lack the federally mandated protections that apply to credit and debit cards. The funds loaded on prepaid cards need not be  insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, for instance, though many issuers provide F.D.I.C. insurance voluntarily. Some offer the same loss and theft safeguards as debit or credit cards; others donât. A few allow overdrafts, defeating the whole idea of controlling spending. âI encourage consumers to really read the fine print on these,â said Maggie Flowers, senior program manager at the National Council on Aging. âAll of them have different rules and fees.â The fees can mount, too. The best cards — Consumer Reports gives high marks to Bluebird (an American Express/Walmart product) and Green Dot — set low monthly charges that often can be waived, with few other costs. But other cards require fees when you set them up, when you reload or use an A.T.M., even when you donât use them frequently. âSome are very transparent, and others you have to hunt for the information — and even then itâs not clear,â Ms. Tetreault said.Â  Consumer Union has published tips for users; so has the National Council on Aging. Clearly, a prepaid card wonât work for every older person confused about money. Perhaps the cardholder canât remember his PIN or loses the card so regularly it serves little purpose. But large numbers of seniors can use, and misuse, checking accounts and debit and credit cards, which sometimes leads them into trouble. At least a prepaid card could limit their losses — not only from scamsters, but from pushy marketers, overzealous investment counselors orÂ because of their own ill-advised spending. Theoretically, anyway. If you have used a prepaid card to help an older relative maintain independence and solvency, we would like to hear how it has gone in the comments.
