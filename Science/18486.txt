 Flu shots for mothers appear to increase the birth weights of their babies, making it more likely they will survive, according to a new study done in Bangladesh. Because the study was small but promising, the researchers received a $10 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to begin a larger one in Nepal. The Bangladesh study, published last week in The Canadian Medical Association Journal, involved 340 urban women. The Nepali one will enroll 3,600. When it was not flu season, there was no weight difference between babies of women who did or did not get flu shots. But during flu season, mothers who got shots in their last trimester gave birth to babies almost seven ounces heavier on average.

Steinhoff, director of children’s global health at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and the leader of the two Southeast Asian studies. The flu season in tropical Asia is less well defined than in wintry climes, Dr. Steinhoff said. But the season can last longer, and which influenza strains are circulating can shift radically when the monsoon rains change direction, meaning the vaccines may also have to be changed.
