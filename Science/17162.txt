 To the Editor: “Driving With Diabetes” (Jan. 29) provides excellent reminders for insulin-dependent diabetic drivers who may experience the symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); however, these symptoms are not always present even when blood sugar levels are dangerously low. Many long-term insulin users develop hypoglycemia unawareness, a condition in which the body becomes acclimated to low blood sugar and the usual warning signs are not given. In my 53 years of insulin use and 25 years of hypoglycemia unawareness, I know the best warning of an oncoming hypoglycemic event is a finger-stick reading on the glucometer that I always carry.
