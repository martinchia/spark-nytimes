 Q. How can plant seeds — tomatoes, for example — survive the digestive processes of birds and other animals and thus be spread in their droppings? A. “Many seeds, including tomatoes, have an impermeable outer layer that protects the seed and allows the delicate embryo to survive the trip through an animal’s digestive system,” said Kerry Barringer, curator of the herbarium at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. “After eating a fruit, the animal carries the seeds away from the parent plant, helping that plant to spread,” Dr. Barringer said. The animal then defecates, leaving the seeds in a rich, moist medium that nourishes the growing seedling. Another factor protecting tomato seeds, he said, is that most will not germinate in the dark, remaining dormant while inside an animal, so “tomato seeds will not grow inside you, but they germinate within a few days once they emerge into the light.” Advertisement Some seeds will not germinate at all unless they pass through an animal, said Dr. Barringer, an expert on local plant species. “The hard seeds of our native raspberries and blackberries need to be abraded in a bird’s gizzard or eroded by digestive acids before water and air can enter the seed and germination can begin,” he said. To grow these plants from seed, gardeners may soak the seeds in sulfuric acid or scrape them with a file or sandpaper. Advertisement C.
