 To the Editor: Re “Race to Space, Through the Lens of Time” (May 24): John Noble Wilford’s essay helps us understand the rationale and political value of human space flight. But I disagree with the conclusion that Apollo was bad for NASA and space exploration — even though its follow-up has been so disappointing. While human spaceflight has been stuck in Earth orbit since Apollo, robotic space exploration has taken us throughout the solar system with both adventure and discovery at many worlds. Exploration of the planets is just as much a legacy of Apollo as is human spaceflight — perhaps even more so, since exploration is what the Moon venture symbolizes to the world. Human spaceflight remains uplifting and creates hope for the future, but we must focus it beyond the Moon for a new generation and new era of explorers. Louis Friedman Pasadena, Calif.
