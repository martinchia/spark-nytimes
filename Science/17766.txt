 To the Editor: In “From Birth, Engage Your Child With Talk” (Personal Health, Sept. 29), Jane E. Brody makes the unsurprising point that speaking to young children helps develop their communication skills. Far more surprising is Ms. Brody’s condemnation of “mothers and nannies” for being too distracted too talk to their babies. Ms. Brody’s deliberate singling out of “mothers” rather than “parents” is unexplained and infuriating. Perhaps she is simply acknowledging the truth that mothers continue to spend more time on child care than fathers, but this is all the more reason to make the point that fathers, too, have tremendous capacity to influence their children’s development simply by communicating. Katherine Agonis Chicago  To the Editor: I could not agree more with Ms. Brody’s exhortation to talk and read to young children all the time. It reminded me of the game that my husband, a chemistry professor, and I would play with our daughter when she was 2. We would each hold one of her hands, and on every step we would lift her up and say one of the elements of the periodic table. By the time she was 4, she could recite the first 45 elements of the period table (up to Rhodium), on demand. Susan Poser Lincoln, Neb. A version of this letter appears in print on October 6, 2009, on Page D4 of the National edition with the headline: Talking To Children.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
