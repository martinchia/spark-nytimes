 Re “BPA Levels Tied to Obesity in Youths” (Vital Signs, Sept. 25): The information in this article is framed in a manner implying Bisphenol A (BPA) may be a cause of childhood obesity. It is reasonable to assume that obese youths more often eat foods packaged in materials coated with BPA. Therefore, increased levels of BPA do not cause obesity, but result from it. The article mentions that the study controlled for the diet of the children with the highest levels of BPA in their urine, but they did not monitor such levels in the majority of participants in the study.
