 Q. The optical Large Synoptic Survey Telescope is supposed to measure dark matter. Since dark matter is invisible, how can an optical telescope see it? A. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, a proposed public-private project for which money is  being raised by the LSST Corporation (www.lsst.org), plans to study time-lapse images of stars distorted by gravitational lensing, with the gravity coming from invisible dark matter. “According to Einstein, gravity warps both space and time,” explained Alan J. Friedman, consulting senior scientist for the New York Hall of Science. Small objects like  Earth “produce only a modest warping of space and time.” “But massive galaxies of stars,” Dr. Friedman said, “or large amounts of dark matter warp space and time around them so much that any light rays that happen to pass through these warped spaces are visibly bent, smeared around, even split up, so it might seem they came from multiple directions.” The result, he said, is that light from a distant galaxy may appear in telescopes to be coming from several  galaxies, but all with exactly the same characteristics. When scientists see this, they know the light from the distant galaxy must have passed through warped space before getting to them, he said.  They can measure the distortion to calculate what matter is causing it, even if that warping matter is completely dark.
