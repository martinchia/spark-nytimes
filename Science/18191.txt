 Studying Snow From the Inside To the Editor: Re “Studying Snow From the Inside” (Jan. 20): I am grateful to the researchers who study avalanches to mitigate the terrible toll they take on property and human life. But avalanches are a natural phenomenon, like tornadoes and hurricanes, and their impact is directly related to the decisions that individuals make. Even a neurotically cautious climber can get into trouble. A third of the way up the final slope on Mount Goode in California, I balked. I informed my climbing partner that the avalanche risk was just too great and I descended — backward! He had second thoughts too and followed me down. We should not have been on the slope in the first place. Robert Hauptman South Burlington, Vt. Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
