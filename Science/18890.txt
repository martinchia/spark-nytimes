Solve a medical mystery with Dr. Lisa Sanders. The Challenge: Can you solve a medical mystery involving a 25-year-old man who gets sweaty and nauseated and starts vomiting uncontrollably every few weeks? Every month the Diagnosis column of The New York Times Magazine asks Well readers to sift through a difficult medical case and solve a diagnostic riddle. In this case, the emergency room physician gives the patient a diagnosis but the doctor caring for him doesn’t think it’s the right one.  Iâll give you all the information that was available when the patient first appeared in the emergency room. Iâll also give you the patient history and physical exam and test results obtained by the emergency room physician. After that, itâs up to you to use this information to make the correct diagnosis.  As usual, the first person to crack the case gets a copy of my book, âEvery Patient Tells a Story,â and that warm feeling you get when you figure out a tough puzzle. The Patient’s Story: 
“Dad, I need to go to the hospital,” the young man croaked in a near whisper barely audible over the hum of the traffic around them. “I’m sick again.”  His father glanced over at his 25-year-old son and knew he was in trouble. The young man’s face was drained of color and shiny with sweat despite the frigid winter day. The father took the next exit and headed back toward Waterbury Hospital, in Connecticut.  A Tough Way to Start the Day: 
The young man had woken early that morning with the familiar weight in his stomach that always preceded these terrible attacks. He forced himself out of bed and did a few push-ups. The pressure in his stomach worsened ominously. His mouth was flooded with the taste of bile, a hint of what was to come. If he could just manage to take his anti-nausea medication and crawl into a hot shower, he might still be able to fight it off.  The hot shower had seemed to work, leaving him feeling remarkably good, with no nausea, and none of the dread that seemed to come with it. He made a cup of coffee and buttered a muffin. Maybe it was going to be a good day after all.  His father drove him to the methadone center, where he got the daily dose that kept him from relapsing into his heroin habit. But standing in line, waiting for the little cup of red liquid that would allow him to go to work, the heaviness again settled in his stomach. He gulped the cherry-flavored liquid and hurried back to the car.  He sat quietly with his eyes closed as his father drove them toward the house where theyâd both be working that day. The car had barely made it to the Interstate when the young man felt the full force of nausea hit him. Suddenly he was icy-cold inside his winter coat. Sweat streamed from every pore. Acid burned deep in his throat.  And he knew that he wasn’t going to make it to work. Maybe he could get to the hospital before he started vomiting, because once he started, there was no stopping. Not for hours.  Another Emergency Room Visit:  When his father pulled into the emergency room parking lot, the young man eased himself out of the car. He hadn’t taken more than a half-dozen steps before he fell to his knees and began vomiting.  By the time he made it to the E.R., his shirt, his sweater and even the lining of his coat were drenched in sweat and covered in vomit. He pulled on the hospital gown and lay down next to a large pink basin, bracing himself for the next round of vomiting.  The nurse gave him a dose of anti-nausea medicine through the IV she had placed. It had just started to kick in when the E.R. doctor came into the cubicle where the young man lay. He told the doctor that he had these episodes of nausea regularly, perhaps a couple of times a month.  Sometimes he could tough it out. But far too often he ended up either here or at the hospital across town. At first he blamed his heroin habit â withdrawal produced the same kind of dread he felt before the nausea hit. But he’d given up all those drugs: heroin, marijuana, cocaine. He’d been clean for months. Heâd even quit smoking. Why was he still getting sick? Making a Diagnosis: The young man was no longer sweaty but still looked tired and uncomfortable. His blood pressure was high and his belly was tender. The doctor wasn’t surprised.  The labs drawn earlier suggested that he had pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas, which makes the chemicals that break down food in the small intestine. Certain medications, alcohol or some diseases can cause the same caustic chemicals to be released inside the pancreas itself, where they start breaking down its delicate tissues as if they were food.  When that happens, the patient will have nausea and vomiting and terrible pain in the belly just below the ribs and often radiating to the back. All doctors can do then is to ease the pain and keep the patient from becoming dehydrated from all the vomiting as the injured tissues recover.  The doctor finished up the paperwork â the young man definitely wasn’t going home.  You can see the emergency room triage notes here.

The Wrong Diagnosis? Dr. Virginia Brady, the resident on call that day, hurried down to the E.R. after hearing about the young man with pancreatitis. She was accompanied by DamÃ© Idossa, a third-year medical student learning the ins and outs of caring for patients in the hospital.  The patient was asleep when the young doctor and the student entered the room. A slender tattooed arm was slung across his face. A large basin at his side crowded the narrow stretcher.  The medical student stepped closer and called the young man’s name. He awakened quickly and sat up. After wiping the sweat from his shiny face, he told of the day’s on-again, off-again nausea and devastating vomiting.  A dozen similar episodes filled his electronic medical chart.  It was frustrating, he told Dr. Brady. He used to think these attacks were caused by his excesses, but he had given up alcohol years ago, and then drugs as well, a few months ago. And the methadone program made sure he stayed clean with regular urine tests. But he was still getting sick as a dog. Why? Are you sure you’ve taken no drugs at all?, the doctor asked. The patient replied that the only drugs he took were an antidepressant; an antihistamine, to help him when he had trouble sleeping; and a nausea pill when he needed it.  And, he added with a trace of reluctance, there was this stuff called Spice, synthetic marijuana, which he bought off the shelf at a little neighborhood store. He smoked that regularly. But it was really just a bunch of dried weeds —  legal, and definitely not marijuana, he told them. Otherwise it would show up in the urine tests he had to take practically every week.  Solving the Mystery: On examination, the patient’s blood pressure had come down and his belly was soft and without tenderness. His bowel sounds were a quieter than normal but the rest of his exam was unremarkable.  So, Dr. Brady wondered, what had made this young man so sick? The nausea and vomiting and elevated pancreatic enzymes revealed by the blood test certainly suggested pancreatitis. But the ultrasound showed a totally normal pancreas. Moreover, patients with pancreatitis usually have a lot of abdominal pain. It’s an excruciating condition. And yet the patient had no tenderness at all in his belly.  Can you figure out what this young man has? Dr. Brady did.  Make your guesses in the comments box. I’ll post the answer on Friday.  Updated, Friday March 7, 3:28 p.m. | Thanks for all your responses.
