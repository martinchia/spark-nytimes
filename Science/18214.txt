 To the Editor: Re “Benefits of Mammogram Under Debate in Britain” (March 31): One year ago, as a 54-year-old with lifelong good habits and no family history of cancer, a mammogram showed several nodules that were malignant. It was 13 months since my previous mammogram, and in the interim I had had two breast exams by medical professionals. Possibly due to “dense breasts,”  only the mammogram detected my aggressive cancer. A mastectomy and a course of chemotherapy and radiation followed. A year later, I am “clear.” This morning, I packed lunch for my  daughter and saw her off on the school bus. Then I went to play tennis on this beautiful spring morning. I could not have done that without the lifesaving information of a mammogram. Valery EinhornRhinebeck, N.Y.  To the Editor: As a breast cancer survivor, I have been amazed and upset by articles citing “experts” who claim that mammography is overused and creates too much anxiety. My cancer was discovered by a mammogram. So was my mother’s, my aunt’s and several cousins’. I’d rather have the anxiety than be dead. Can diagnosis be improved? Of course. But in the meantime, sensible women will continue to get regular screenings.
