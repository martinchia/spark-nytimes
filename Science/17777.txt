 To the Editor: Re “When an Ear Witness Decides the Case” (Basics, June 23): Natalie Angier writes that emerging evidence suggests that mammals don’t share the human love for music. Yet my two cats refute this theory, and even display a preference for certain kinds of music. My male tabby prefers opera and is a Pavarotti fanatic, while my older, female tabby only likes symphonic pieces, with a special passion for Mahler led by Bernstein. The only music they both loathe (besides rock and pop) is that produced by my violin — particularly in the upper register, when they let out meows of protest and head for the litter box, which I interpret as a feline way of expressing themselves as true music critics.
