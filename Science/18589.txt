For years, pregnant and nursing women have been warned to limit the amount of fish they eat, because many marine species may contain high levels of mercury, which endangers newborns and fetuses. Yesterday, however, a children’s health group challenged the conventional wisdom, advising pregnant women and nursing mothers to eat more fish so as to ensure optimal brain development in their babies. What’s going on here? Currently, the Food and Drug Administration advises pregnant women to limit their weekly seafood consumption to no more than 12 ounces, or about two servings, per week. The newest recommendation comes from the National Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition, a nonprofit group that focuses on childhood health issues. That group’s scientific advisors say that pregnant women and nursing mothers should eat at least 12 ounces of fish per week.  Although both recommendations acknowledge that pregnant women can safely eat about two servings a week, fears of mercury contamination in seafood have prompted many pregnant women to forgo fish entirely. And here’s the conundrum: an increasing number of studies indicate that omega-3 fatty acids, found mostly in fish, are essential to brain development in fetuses and newborns.  Earlier this year, a report in The Lancet, a medical journal, concluded that women who had eaten more than 12 ounces of fish per week during pregnancy produced better developed, more intelligent children. âAdvice that limits seafood consumption might reduce the intake of nutrients necessary for optimum neurological development,â wrote scientists from the National Institutes of Health and the University of Illinois at Chicago. “The real problem here are the women who are just eliminating fish from their diet,” said Judy Meehan, executive director of the National Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition. “Eating 12 ounces is a very safe, smart move, and nobody is disputing that.” While none of the research cited yesterday in the coalition’s recommendations has been funded by the fish industry, the coalition is using a grant from the National Fisheries Institute, a seafood industry group, to fund its educational campaign, according to Ms. Meehan.  For women who want the health benefits but worry about mercury and other toxins, the wisest course is to choose fish with the lowest levels of mercury. A recent report in The Journal of the American Medical Association concluded that the health benefits are likely greatest from such oily fish as salmon, herring and sardines â which are all generally low in mercury anyway. Among the fish to avoid are shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish, all of which may contain high levels of mercury. Comments are no longer being accepted. Wouldn’t the SMARTEST thing for a pregnant woman to do in this case be to take OTC omega-3 supplements? Yeah let’s take advice from the people selling the products. Who was this study sponsored by some interest who has a interest in seeing seafood consumption go up/
Or by some special interest group in Rx industry?
Buyer beware!! Why not eat fish oil capsules? Pregnant Women: Eat Fish! Donât Eat Fish! Assuming a few of the items on the Oceans Aliveâs âsafe fish listâ are less deadly than the others, how would the average pregnant woman or nursing mother ensure the fish she eats is, say, the Atlantic mackerel (!) and not the king [mercury, PCB, dioxin] mackerel, or farmed striped bass, instead of the wild [PCB, mercury, dioxin] striped bass? Here’s another idea, don’t eat fish to get your omega 3’s, eat *other* foods which contain omega 3’s.  By serving size, walnuts and flaxseed actually contain more omega 3’s than fish and NO mercury.  2 tbs of flaxseed have 140% of your daily value of omega 3, and 95.3 calories.  A quarter cup of walnuts has 90% of your daily value and 163.5 calories.  For comparison, a 4oz salmon has 83% of your daily value and 260 calories.  Salmon has much lower nutrient density than those other two options, and the possibility of containing mercury. Where do you guys think fish oil comes from?  Palm trees? Look a little closer at the facts. Omega- 3’s are available to pregnant mothers through many other non-fish sources. This group of scientists received $60,000 for their recommendation from the fishery industry.  Also the Scientific report in The Lancet does not make any direct correlation between intake of Omega 3’s and intelligent children, additionally the mothers in the study may have also been eating a lot of broccoli with their fish and that is why they had the results they did, there is no direct link to pregnant mothers eating fish (any amount) and having smarter babies.  Finally there are many other reasons to not eat many of the fish mentioned in this story.  Species like swordfish, bluefin tuna and commercially exploited tilefish are all basically endangered species. Having been fished to the brink of extinction by the same industry funding these groups and trying desperately to make pregnant mothers think that they will have dumb children if they donât  eat a certain amount of  fish.  If you want smart children, and oceans that are not devoid of all marinelife mothers should teach their children to eat a BALANCED diet heavy on vegetables and fruits, and not grow up to be COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN! Interesting , in our part of world ( south india ) traditionally ,pregnant women are advised to eat sea foods as they are good! And even some vegetarian moms start eating fish during that time Fish is healthy, whether preggys or not. Notice most of the comments are from men who suggest taking a pill. Eating what is natural is far better than some pill. Pills shouldn’t be consumed to replace what should come naturally. I am pregnant w/my second & I eat fish when I crave it and just because. Pills are not the answer for everyone & some of us simply can’t stomach it…So, when you can have babies, men, then you can tell us what to eat & what not to. As for the article, it is an article…don’t take it to heart. barnetto,  Flax oil only has the Omega 3 Fatty Acid ALA, which is hard for the body to absorb.  Fish oil, by comparison, have EPA and DHA fatty acids which are more bio-available to the human body.  You spent plenty of research looking us USRDA and calorie amounts, yet totally missied the bio-chemistry point of your argument. Many may not understand that the reason to avoid fish consumption is due to the HIGH levels of Mercury in seafood.
As a person who has been dealing with this problem of mercury toxicity, I would recommend AVOIDING fish. HOWEVER, Pregnant and nursing Mom’s SHOULD supplement with High Quality Fish oils and Flax oils. There are even some fish oils that guarantee low Heavy Metal (Mercury) content.
What’s the big deal with Heavy Metal content some may say… BRAIN Damage and Overal Central Nervous System dysfuntion.
Who wants that for their Child?  Autism anyone? Farmed salmon have demonstrably lower levels of Omega-3 compared to wild salmon, due to being fed on corn rather than krill.  The study isn’t complete if it doesn’t consider the differences between farmed and wild seafood when it’s for a specific nutrient.  Like a previous poster said, if it’s for the Omega-3 specifically, wouldn’t a supplement be a “sure thing”? When my mother was pregnant, in the early 60s, she ate lots of fish because accepted wisdom was that it was ‘brain food’.  When I excelled academically she was happy to take the credit and I scoffed at this ‘old wives tale’…..now it seems she may have been right all along! Fish is a great source of protein but if you just want O3s take the molecularly distilled form or a great brand like Nordic Naturals. I worry about blanket precautions, considering our fish come from vastly different parts of the world.  As I live in Dubai, much of the local fresh fish comes from the Indian Ocean.  And packaged fish comes from you name it.  I would love to know where I can find out about PCB Mercury levels by gloabl harvest region, rather than by type of fish. Just what the unborn baby needs, . . . mercury poisoning. Stick with supplements. If you eat plenty of GARLIC there should not be a problem. Japanese women, who have the longest lifespan, have much higher mercury levels than American women, yet their children have consistently scored higher on intellectual tests than American children.  Scientists who warn against the dangers of mercury disregard data that questions their position.  Japan consumes 30% of the world’s tuna catch. Omega 3/Fish Capsules do not work! Look it up on pubmed How does mercury find its way into certain fish in the first place?  I assume it’s basically polution, but I would like to see a more detailed answer.  Who put the mercury in the fish, and how did they do it?  AND ARE THEY STILL DOING IT? I’m writing this comment as a holistic nutritionist who has studied this topic. If you look to the research of dentist, Dr. Weston Price, the pioneering nutrition researcher from the 1930s, it is well documented in his book ” Nutrition and Physical Degeneration,â that traditional cultures from all over the world have provided women in childbearing years with plenty of seafood.  Women would change their diets leading up to marriage to prepare for strongest fertility outcomes by increasing their intake of sea foods.  During pregnancy and postpartum as well, these women ate plenty of seafood for healthy pregnancy and healthy babies. Not only for the omega 3s but for other fat-soluble vitamins that are best consumed directly from the food source. Today, while we do not have the pristine oceans, rivers and streams of days past, seafood is still a crucial part of the diet for women in their childbearing years and throughout pregnancy.  Unfortunately we do need to take extra time to educate ourselves on the best sources for untainted fish.  Please note, the article did not say to eat tuna or sword fish, instead recommending salmon, herring and sardines which have less of a mercury problem and more of the nutrients we are seeking. I agree with the comments that we should not trust research paid for by the industry that will benefit from the outcome.  However, once again, research dating back to Dr. Price already proved that women and babies benefit from fish. It is always best to get nutrients from the food source first.  Supplements vary in quality across brands and can also prove toxic if not properly absorbed by the body.  Our body can usually handle higher levels of a vitamin or mineral from a food source when the same amount of that vitamin/mineral in a supplement can be harmful. What most folks don’t understand is that fish do not make omega 3 fatty acids in their bodies. They get it from what they eat. The base source of omega 3 in fish is algae. The fish either eat algae, or they eat other things that eat algae, and the omega 3s get concentrated up the food chain. It’s true that ALA omega 3 isn’t as easily used by the body as DHA and EPA. But there are perfectly lovely vegetarian sources of DHA and EPA omega 3 fatty acid supplements that come straight from the source – algae – and have NO mercury or other harmful contaminants. I would advise everyone who is concerned about getting mercury from fish but who still wants their omega 3s to google “vegetarian omega 3 EPA DHA”.   For the previous poster who asked where the mercury comes from, mercury contamination in fish comes from natural sources and pollution. One source of mercury in fish here in California is mercury that was left over from the gold rush mining day when gold was extracted from rocks using mercury and much of that mercury remained in river sediments – this 200-year-old mercury gets into fish when it gets stirred up and mixed with oxygen (becoming methylmercury, which is easily absorbed by living things).  Another source of mercury pollution is from air pollution from power plants, especially coal-fired plants. This form of pollution can be from local plants, or it can drift thousands of miles. Here in CA, we get significant mercury air pollution (which can water pollution and gets into fish) blowing over from China. Are the polluters still polluting today? Yes. In the US we have regulations about how much mercury can be emitted by our power plants, but many folks argue that they are not strict enough and that they have recently been weakened by the EPA under the current administration. Google “EPA weaken mercury regulations”. Read several articles – don’t just rely on one source. What about the Omega-3 eggs? Does anyone have any idea what those are all about? How do you explain that, although because of severe allergy, I cannot eat any fish or seafood, my babies were all unusually healthy with HIGH IQs?
