 To the Editor: Re “Parents, Relax. Don’t Keep Them From School. It’s Just Lice.” (Personal Health, Sept. 21): I believe that the opinion of the American Academy of Pediatrics is misguided. When my daughter attended elementary school in a New York City public school, she had recurrent lice infestations throughout the school year for six years. Her school did not have a “no nit” policy and children were not sent home.  I worked in a private school that also experienced lice infestations each year. That school did have a no-nit policy. And as a result, all these children may have contracted it once or twice their entire elementary school experience. Lorri Paulucci Brooklyn Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
