 This dish is great for Thanksgiving and always goes over well. Once you’ve tried it you’ll never want those candied yams again. 2 pounds sweet potatoes, scrubbed 2 tart apples, such as Granny Smith or Braeburn Juice of 1 lime 1/4 cup plain low-fat yogurt 1 to 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted (to taste) 1 tablespoon mild flavored honey, such as clover Pinch of salt 1. Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Scrub sweet potatoes and pierce in several places with a sharp knife. Pierce the apples in a few places. Line a baking sheet with foil and place the potatoes and apples on top. Bake for 40 minutes and remove the apples. Continue to bake the sweet potatoes until thoroughly soft and beginning to ooze, 5 to 15 minutes, depending on the size. Remove from the heat and allow to cool until cool enough to handle. 2. Turn the oven down to 350ºF. Remove the skins from the potatoes. Peel and core the apples, scraping all the flesh from just inside the skins. Chop the potatoes and apples coarsely and place in a food processor fitted with the steel blade. Puree until smooth. Add the remaining ingredients and blend well. Transfer to a lightly buttered 2- or 3-quart baking dish. 3. Heat the puree in the 350ºF oven for 20 to 30 minutes, until steaming. Serve hot. Yield: Serves 6  Advance preparation: This can be made through Step 2 a day ahead and kept covered in the refrigerator. Reheating will take 30 to 40 minutes.
