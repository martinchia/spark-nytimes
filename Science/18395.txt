 To the Editor: “Learning to Cope With Underwater Din” (July 17) reports that a single captive whale has been trained to “turn down the gain” on its hearing to avoid loud experimental sounds. The lead researcher speculates that this mechanism might explain why the impacts of noise are not even more devastating and may someday lead to improved mitigation. But nothing in this study or in the quotes from scientists suggests that wild animals are currently coping with our noise. Readers who didn’t make it past the headline would have been left with the impression that reducing ocean noise is unnecessary. Gail L. Patricelli Davis, Calif.
