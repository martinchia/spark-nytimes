I got the e-mail late last Wednesday night. Weâd watched President Obamaâs speech on health care at a friend’s house, and I was getting ready for bed since I had to be at the hospital at 7 the next morning for work. Then I read the message. It was from a White House staff member asking me if I “might be available” to attend a nurses’ event in Washington “with the President, in support of health care reform.â  Um, well, yeah, sure! The staffer who had contacted me told me that my recent Well post on health care reform, (âA Nurseâs View of Health Reform,â) was an example of why they were fighting so hard to improve health care in America. I live in Pennsylvania but found a 6:15 a.m. flight that would get me to Washington on time. But I felt hesitant about calling off from my shift, even for a meeting at the White House. My husband took me firmly in hand. âCall work,â he said, âCall them right now.â   When I explained to Wendy, the charge nurse, about my last minute invite, she didn’t hesitate to change the schedule. I was so excited I couldnât sleep but now had to wake up at 4 a.m. to get my flight. With just one hour of sleep under my belt I made it to D.C., found a Starbucks near Pennsylvania Avenue so that I could get my fix, and set out for the White House. When I arrived in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, I found an auditorium filled with nurses. Eventually, a White House staff member led me to a reserved seat in the front row. Another thanked me for writing about health reform from a nurse’s perspective. âWe all read it,â she said, âHe read it.” Every White House staff member I met talked very fast, and every conversation I had with one of them seemed to start in the middle. (More than anything I attributed this manic behavior to sleep deprivation, a state of mind and body I recognize easily.) Before the President’s talk, I was directed to a holding room, where Becky Patton, the president of the American Nurses Association, along with three other nurses and I were to meet the President. âIs that O.K.?â the staffer asked me. I wondered if anyone ever says no. The other nurses and I were talking in the holding room when Secret Service agents appeared, and someone said quietly, âHere comes the President.â And then President Obama was there. He said hi to Becky Patton and joked with her. He shook the other nurseâs hands and then he shook mine, âHi Theresa Brown.â   Already he was turning away when someone called out, âGreat speech last night.â  Then President Obama told the five of us gathered there, in a low voice, as if he was also telling himself, âWeâre going to do it this time.â  I went back to my seat in the auditorium and watched Becky Patton introduce the President. He gave a great “I-love-nurses, rally-the-troops” speech. And then I heard him repeat part of the story I had written a few weeks ago. Sometimes it can be easy to lose sight of what the debate over reform is all about. It’s about stories like the one told by an oncology nurse named Theresa Brown. A few weeks ago, Theresa wrote a blog post about a patient of hers. He was in his 60s, a recent grandfather, a Steelers fan — spent the last three months of his life worrying about mounting medical bills. And she wrote: “My patient thought he had planned well for his health care needs. He just never thought he would wake up one day with a diagnosis of leukemia. But which of us does?” she asked. And then she wrote: “That’s why we need health care reform.”
  It was a proud moment not just for me, but for all nurses. The President quoted a nurse — a floor nurse. I flew home that afternoon and got to work the next day for a 7 a.m. shift that ended up being 14 hours long and involved more than its usual share of absurdities. People wanted to hear my White House story, and I told it as best I could in between questions about dopamine drips, trying out different anti-nausea meds, and comforting the family members of a patient on hospice. Every day nurses see just how inhumane disease and illness can be, and we all hope for a more humane system of health insurance coverage. The President was smart to come to nurses for support. Making life better for patients in this country — what could be more natural for a nurse? Comments are no longer being accepted. Theresa, thanks for writing on behalf of all of us who live in fear of medically induced bankruptcy. Keep writing Theresa! The world needs to hear what ordinary people are going through, and now you know for sure that someone who can make a difference is reading and listening. I do wish that President Obama, among others, would consult a good dictionary for the distinction between the words “insurance” and “charity”. I worked in an ER 17 blocks from the Capitol when the Clintons tried in 1994.  I always used to say, “Hillary needs to come here and see what it’s like!” Now, I’m more inclined to say, “I want opponents of reform to spend some time in the shoes of a floor nurse,” or in my old shoes, as a hospice nurse.   I think that would put talk of ‘death panels’ to rest… real quick! Congratulations and here’s hoping! My husband just lost his 3rd job in 2 years.  We are living on 20% of what we lived on 4 years ago (when we thought we were struggling.)  Thankfully, my job offers incredible benefits and is (jinx) stable.  Unfortunately, I am putting off some tests simply because I can’t face what the results will be (it’s something recurring) and the probability that I will have to take some time off of work for treatment.  So, here’s hoping the 3 interviews next week go well. Thanks again, Theresa. Someone IS listening! Wow yet another self congratulatory nurse posting…Why don’t you ever write a post praising doctors who after all the ones that you would go to when sick? James, what are you talking about?  Are you saying that health care for those who can’t afford it should depend on charity?  Are we returning to the 19th century?   It is in ALL of our interests for everyone to be healthy and productive, not just those who can afford private insurance.  Medicare for All! Li-hsia Wang, MD I, too, was treated for leukemia last year and spent my share of time with “floor nurses” who took excellent care of me during every one of my 25 chemo treatments. I cannot think of anyone more capable of commenting on how our healthcare system fails us at our most vulnerable moment. I thoroughly enjoy Nurse Brown’s perspective as I am sure President Obama did, and I’m a primary care doctor. Single Payer would do exactly what we need: Give all of us the same healthcare plans of our elected officials. I’m so tired of watching the insurance companies and pharmaceuticals pay those who are too ignorant to know what they’re doing when they protest against a “public option”. The media should be educating us, not just sensationalizing a few ignoramuses.  I commend the NY Times for giving informed personnel such as nurses a forum — and to the Obama administration for doing what no president has done before: Give a public option — hopefully single payer — a chance As a retired ICU doc, I really enjoy reading your essays.  I’ve always believed in the team approach to health care.  The nurse plays the most intimate role and is often the best spokesperson to the patient’s wishes.  I hope and pray that the excellent care available to some (we ration now by ability to pay) can be made available to the millions who now live in fear of a medical crisis.

//www.endoflifeblog.com Wow!  Congratulations, and thank you again for your wonderful article. #10:  you are mistaken about the health plans that elected officials have — it’s definitely NOT single payer.  The same insurance companies that private employers use are in the FEHB:  Blue Cross, Aetna, Anthem, United Health, etc.  These insurers contract with OPM just as they would with a private employer, and federal employees (like me) pay a premium, with our employer paying its share. Wow, how cool for you, Theresa!  I’ve been reading your posts since you started here and just wanted to say a huge thanks for bringing the realities of floor nursing to the public. (I suppose this is also thanks to Tara and NYT for giving you a forum). I am a relatively new second-career RN also. I recognize the absurdities of our stupid healthcare system you see and describe so well, since I am faced with them too. Frontline nursing is so challenging yet rewarding, it’s time more people knew and understood what we do and why.  So thanks for that. Never doubt that in your contribution to the national dialogue, you are making a difference. Re #8: “Are you saying that health care for those who canât afford it should depend on charity?” No, I’m saying that health care for those who can’t afford it IS charity, by definition.   “It is in ALL of our interests for everyone to be healthy and productive…” Sure, but you really need to start from the other end.  Getting people to exercise, lose weight, quit smoking, and so forth would do more for the total national health that any amount of government-provided health insurance.  The problem is that people would have to do this themselves, instead of offloading the responsibility on to someone else. Congratulations Theresa.
The crucial question is that nurses can do to improve the lives of our patients, we must have a health system more humane. Through the life stories of our patients we understand our actions as nurses.  Congratulations again. “If they are going to die, let them die, and decrease the surplus population.” — Charles Dickens. Yay!! He quoted a nurse, and he meant it (and actually read your column)! Health should not be a matter of profit. Everyone deserves to be treated and have access to good primary care. Doctors and nurses and other health personnel deserve decent working hours, good pay, and educational opportunities. It must be heartbreaking to watch your patients suffer needlessly for lack of funds. If the time to get everyone covered is not now, when?? #15, you make exercise, quitting smoking, and eating a proper diet seem so easy, and yet in our stressed-out, workaholic, fast-food addicted society it really is not. People working two jobs–or even many hours at one job–who commute two hours to an office–when do they have time to cook or exercise or attend smoking cessation programs?  Corporate America has benefited for years from the sacrifice of millions of American workers. Universal health care–including prevention and wellness–is not charity. We have already paid and paid. V-
Why is it a “doctors against nurses” thing?  While I appreciate that nurses can’t diagnose or treat the way doctors can, if there is one person on the health care team that you need on your side, it’s your nurse.  They have more interaction with the patient, are often the first one to notice changes, usually know a patient’s wishes, and work tirelessly as the patient’s advocate.  I hope that if you are ever sick, you don’t carry that attitude about nurses and doctors into the hospital with you. Theresa, do you have any thoughts about why we don’t see more nurses pushing for reform?  I’ve been to lots of rallies, and although there are not a whole lot of us physicians there, there are even fewer nurses.  And trust me, when they do get up to talk, they get a standing ovation as soon as they say “I’m a nurse.” I’ve tried to rally some of the nurses I work with to come to rallies with me and to call their senators and representatives, but haven’t had much luck personally.  Looking at the national scene too, the only big nurses’ group that has a prominent voice is the California Nurses association. What’s going on?  How can we get your stories out there?  Patients are certainly telling their stories, physicians are as well (to a degree), but we’re missing out on an important perspective from people who are vital to our health system and interact with the system in a different way than either physicians or patients. “When I arrived in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, I found an auditorium filled with nurses.” I hope they had donuts–those gals can get cranky when they’re hypoglycemic! I agree with Susan MD.  Why aren’t more nurses speaking out about health care reform?  We are intimately involved in it.  For example, there is a controversy brewing in England about doctors not attempting to save a premature infant who was not compatible with life.  US pundits seized hold of this and claimed it is health care rationing from the NHS that will be coming to America.  Has America lost it’s mind?
//realityrounds.com/2009/09/15/is-letting-a-21-week-premature-baby-die-considered-health-care-rationing/ When compassionate people with excellent ability to articulate their thoughts and feelings step up for a cause, good things happen.  I am talking as much about Nurse Brown as I am about President Obama.  Great work, Nurse Brown. Perhaps you could tell us one of these days how and why you went from teaching English at a college to being an RN. FROM TPP — Theresa has written about her career change. The Night the Professor Became a Nurse #15- you make charity seem like a bad word.  Are oil company subsidies a charity?  how about tax write-offs for pro sports teams’ stadiums? Were Bush’s tax cuts to the wealthiest also a charity? when a fireman comes out to put out the fire in your house or in the forests near your house, are you a beshamed recipient of charity? Sigh. If only Nurse Brown’s patient could’ve waited till 65 before contracting leukemia, he could’ve gotten all the charity he needed. Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
