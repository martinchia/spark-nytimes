 To the Editor: “Australia’s Changing View of the Dingo” (March 6) highlights the changing perceptions of the dingo in Australia but fails to mention a similar situation regarding coyotes in North America. In 2009, an woman was stalked and killed by coyotes in Cape Breton Highlands National Park in Nova Scotia. In the changing landscape of the environment in the 21st century, it is worth remembering that canine species are by nature predatory and that we humans are not excluded from their list of prey.
