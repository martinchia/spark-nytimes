The best-selling book “Born to Run” popularized the notion of barefoot running, and as a result, scores of runners have given up cushioned shoes and opted to exercise barefoot or in barely-there running shoes. But as the book’s author, Christopher McDougall, explains in this week’s New York Times Magazine, many barefoot runners still don’t know how to run. âBarefoot-styleâ shoes are now a $1.7 billion industry. But simply putting something different on your feet doesnât make you a gliding Tarahumara. The âone best wayâ isnât about footwear. Itâs about form. Learn to run gently, and you can wear anything. Fail to do so, and no shoe â or lack of shoe â will make a difference…. The only way to halt the running-injury epidemic, it seems, is to find a simple, foolproof method to relearn what the Tarahumara never forgot. A one best way to the one best way. Earlier this year, I may have found it. I was leafing through the back of an out-of-print book, a collection of runnersâ biographies called âThe Five Kings of Distance,â when I came across a three-page essay from 1908 titled âW. G. Georgeâs Own Account From the 100-Up Exercise.â According to legend, this single drill turned a 16-year-old with almost no running experience into the foremost racer of his day.
