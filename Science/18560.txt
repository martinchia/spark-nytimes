Recently, I wrote about a 30-year-old patient who had undergone a risky allogeneic stem cell transplant in hopes of winning a battle against an aggressive multiple myeloma. For me, telling his story was a tribute to every patient who suffers the ill effects of cancer treatment in hope of a cure. He died in the early afternoon on Friday, May 15, due to complications from his treatment, just two days after I had written about him. His lungs had filled with fluid, causing him to decline rapidly. The doctors in the intensive care unit put a tube in his chest to drain some of the liquid, trying to keep him alive long enough for the family to gather at the hospital. His name was Craig Dylewski, and he was born October 24, 1978, in Erie, Penn. He had been married just four years to Heidi Vogt Dylewski and was the father of a 2-year-old son named Hayden. He had majored in finance at Penn State Behrend, and later passed the rigorous certification process to become a chartered financial analyst. Before getting sick, he attended his local Methodist church, liked golf, bowling and travel and was dedicated to his family and friends. Like all of us, he was ordinary, and like all of us he was extraordinary. He was the father his son will never know, the husband his wife will mourn, the son and son-in-law who cannot be replaced. We had gotten to know each other well in the hospital and had talked a bit about my writing. I wanted him to see the essay I had written about him, but his body had other ideas. A perforated colon resulted in four surgeries in eight days to try and stop the bleeding in his abdomen. Afterward, he was on a ventilator and was kept under sedation in intensive care to keep him calm. Craig never read what I wrote about him, but Heidi read it to him in the I.C.U., with his family there, listening. She said he raised his arm when she started reading â the first purposive movement heâd made in several days. Such is the power of the word, or so I would like to believe, but nothing about treating cancer is ever that easy. The truth is, we gave Craig a treatment to save his life, and it killed him. He knew the risks and embraced the transplant as his only chance to live; without it, his cancer would have quickly left him dead. He was cancer-free when he died.   Still, everyone wishes for a different result. My preference would be for him never to have had cancer at all — never for anyone to have it — but until that day comes, weâll do the best we can for our patients. I told Heidi, âHe was lucky to have you,â because he was.   She said, âI was lucky, too,â and then her voice caught in her throat, and she cried out, âIt was just too short.â Oncology nurse Theresa Brown is a regular contributor to the Well blog. Comments are no longer being accepted. Thanks to you, he added a grace note to the study and perception of cancer treatment. Theresa,  Thank you for honoring Craig, his family, and all those who battle cancer. Your willingness to open yourself up to patients and befriend them is a gift. Thank you for giving of yourself. May your friendly treatment continue to brighten the lives of those you meet. Reading this, I thought of my own son growing up without knowing me or having me there to protect him and it just reminded me how none of us know anything about our uncertain future.  Just so sad.  When I hear stories like this I’m always grateful to people like you, Theresa, who are there to care and bear witness to the suffering of others. I’ve offered up this essay before on this forum, but maybe it would help Heidi and her family, so I offer it up again–“Letter To A Widow” at //happinessinthisworld.com/2009/02/15/letter-to-a-widow/ //happinessinthisworld.com Theresa, Thank you for being Craig’s voice in this risky ordeal.  Your insights into his leap of faith give us a dimension of him we rarely see in others.  He was far from ordinary, as you make clear. How is this blog entry not a HIPAA violation?  I believe this blog entry would have been more appropriate if you had noted that the patient  had agreed to allow his medical information to be divulged to the public.  Ms. Brown, as a healthcare professional you should know better. FROM TPP — Of course she didn’t violate HIPAA. She has written permission from the family to discuss this and if you read the previous post, you’ll see that the patient himself wanted his story told.  Note to Ben A, MD:  Don’t you think it’s implied in this blog post that Teresa got Heidi’s permission to share Craig’s story?  Furthermore, in her original essay about Craig, if you even read it, she mentioned that in her discussions with the patient he consented to having his story told. Teresa, such a sad story.  Please continue to do your good work.   RNs like me find your writing really inspiring. For ben a., MD, the second paragraph of Ms. Brown’s first article on this patient.
“This patient knows that Iâm a writer, as well as a nurse, and he wanted his story told. So I decided, with his permission, to tell it. Itâs not just his story, though; itâs the story of every patient who stands on the frontier of medicine, opting for a new treatment or risky procedure in hopes of saving his or her own life.” Teresa,
I would like to personally  thank  you for sharing Craig’s story.
I’m Craig’s aunt, and I know Craig, wanted his story shared with others and you told it like it was.  I remember telling Craig, that there was a lesson to come out of all these difficult times.  As always, Craig reply came out.  Yeah, the lesson is not to get cancer.
Craig will be sadly missed, but never forgotten.
Becky Unfortunately “written permission from the family” does not mean that a patient’s identifiable medical history can be divulged by a medical professional caring for that patient.  Yes, the family could reveal those details, but not a medical professional who was directly involved in caring for that patient.   In fact, a medical professional cannot even discuss a patient’s condition with a family member, even a spouse or child, without first obtaining written permission from the patient.  Similarly,  a medical professional who did not participate in his care could also discuss his medical condition, but, again, not a medical professional who provided direct care to that patient. The point is that the author should have explicitly stated in this blog entry (which divulges private, identifiable medical information) that this patient gave her written permission to publish those details in this forum.  A reference to another article does not suffice.  In that piece the author only says “So I decided, with his permission, to tell it”.  That is not the same as clearly stating that he gave her written permission to divulge his private medical information to the millions of readers of the NYT. Both of these entries are powerful, well-written, and moving pieces.  I’m sure that Ms. Brown is accurately reflecting Craig’s wishes, but the HIPAA rules are quite and appropriately strict and I would have appreciated a better clarification of Craig’s consent.  I’m not trying to be a stickler, but trivializing the importance of medical privacy (“Of course she didnât violate HIPAA”)  and the protections HIPAA provides is inappropriate. FROM TPP — I’m sorry but the HIPAA rules don’t require that someone disclose to a newspaper audience that they have complied with HIPAA. All that matters is that you comply with HIPAA. And Theresa has. The bottom line is that you have no standing to complain. Both the family and patient supported Theresa sharing their story. Theresa- I was Craig’s friend as well as a nurse and I want to thank you for taking time to listen to him and share his story. He was a phenomenal young man and will be missed greatly by everyone. His story will not be forgotten. Thank you. Ben Md,
What are you the HIPAA police?  Relax will ya.  Theresa, this was an amazing post.  It shows the gut wrenching life and death decisions people with cancer have to face.  This man and his wife showed tremendous bravery.  I am awed.  Oncology nurses hold a special place in my heart.  My mom died of cancer in 1975, when she was 44 years old, and I was 5.  Thank God for nurses like you who can bring some compassion to hopeless situations.
//realityrounds.com/ No to detract from the beauty of the article.  One should understand that the fact that the family permitted the article is irrelevant. Its good she got permission from the patient, though I hope the consent  was not obtained under medical duress or altered mental status…even dealing with a terminal illness is a distinctly vulnerable state subject to abuse…. Hey ben a.: You are not a stickler, you are just being anal and you are probably outraged and indignant that not everyone in the world is anal like you :) Having said that, determining HIPAA compliance should best be left to those administrators whose job is on the line to ensure HIPAA compliance. Nurse Brown, as a nurse of twenty years of experience and an RN license to lose, does not strike me as the type of individual who fell off the turnip truck and needlessly expose herself to a lawsuit by the family by failing to secure the family’s consent in discussing her patient’s story. SHUT UP already, will you? If I had a kid and he had your attitude, it would only be a matter of “when” not “if” I would do away with myself :) Not that either you or the damn kid would care :) What exactly is this doctor trying to accomplish by harassing the writer about HIPAA?  Perhaps if more people knew the gory details of what much cancer treatment actually entails, we would hear less from those with no direct experience about how having a “positive attitude” and “being a fighter” are keys to survival. My husband, like Craig, accepted every treatment offered for his melanoma.  This included a bilateral lymph node dissection of the groin (picture being flayed open with 8 inch incisions, unable to walk for weeks, lymphydema for the rest of your life), biochemotherapy that destroyed the kidneys, and a vaccine trial that failed too.  He was also a CFA and left our three-year old daughter without her father when he died.  He continued to work even when the daily morphine required to control his pain meant he could no longer drive.  We lived near DC at the time and when  his employer sent a car service to pick him up every morning he joked that the neighbors would think someone important lived at our house.  Someone important did–an ordinary patient just like the subject of this article. Thank you, Theresa, for writing this. FROM TPP — Thanks for sharing this. Theresa; Wonderfully written, as usual, and a fitting tribute to those fighting cancer in anonymity. I am also dealing with multiple myeloma and appreciate the graceful touch you gave to honoring Craig’s life and death. //goodbloodbadblood.wordpress.com/ I never knew Craig but I do know his best friends and between them and Theresa I feel like he could have been my friend or relative.                                                            These articles, in my mind, are outstanding!!  So very many of us have no idea what the cancer road is like for the medical profession.  The fact that there are people like Theresa that do actually care and hurt and do try to do all that is in their power to aid the patient and family is so uplifting.  I personally am thankful that she shares her thoughts and feelings and allows us to take a look at the road no one hopes to have to travel. This was a lovely and touching piece. Ben A, I am glad you are not my doctor (if you are a doctor at all.)  You have way too much free-floating aggression and hostility, and too much free time. Simple question:  Did Ms. Brown, as a medical professional who provided direct care to this patient,  get specific, WRITTEN authorization from Mr. Dylewski to publish his private medical information as required by HIPAA?  If not, publishing that information is a HIPAA violation.  If so, why not let the readers know that his privacy was handled appropriately? FROM TPP — I’ve already answered this question. As I’ve told you before, Ms. Brown took all the necessary steps to ensure that she and her hospital were in compliance with HIPAA. Doctors’ and nurses’ over-interpretation of HIPAA cause a great deal of grief among families. My husband was being tested for dementia at age 48 and the nurse at his clinic refused to tell me the results over the phone, citing HIPAA. So whom did she plan to tell? My husband? It is power-tripping in some instances. As a cancer survivor myself (Stage 4) who went through life threatening chemo, and 5 surgeries, and radiation last year, I feel this story acutely. Above, Craig’s aunt quotes Craig’s message, “don’t get cancer.” I use those words often.  PLEASE take it all seriously. Avoid carcinogens of course, but MOST importantly, get your entire body checked by a doctor at least once a year. Every inch of skin and every nook and cranny. EVERY nook and cranny. Your bum, your throat, your gendered parts. Got it? Cynthia A: thank you for this: “Perhaps if more people knew the gory details of what much cancer treatment actually entails, we would hear less from those with no direct experience about how having a âpositive attitudeâ and âbeing a fighterâ are keys to survival.” I want to add that if, as a patient, you think having cancer means your doctors and nurses are going to treat you really well during your treatment, you are wrong.   Though Nurse Brown has provided us with a lovely article, it certainly does not echo my experience in that every health professional is in it for themselves and does not care about the patient as a person.  They care about getting paid and not getting sued, even if it means betraying confidences. Thanks, Cynthia A., for writing in. I too regret the battle metaphor and the baloney about positive attitude. I am so sorry for your loss.  Caroline Ms. Brown–Thank you for sharing this touching story with your readers.  I am familiar with this story because I know someone from Craig’s family and feel as thought I have been touched by your heartfelt writing.  May God continue to be with you and those medical personnel who work with the sick and their families.  You are a gifted writer and obviously nurse as well.  God Bless You–  Cherie Cynthia A.âs âpositive mental attitudeâ comment is scoring big points with me too.  A positive attitude can certainly impact your quality of life, but large clinical studies have shown that a positive outlook has zero impact on cancer survival rates.   I was diagnosed at 27 and am still living with cancer 9 years later.  What gets me through is a realistic attitude.  I am honest with myself about my survival rates, treatments, and their side effects. I use this information to better advocate for my care.  My realistic and proactive attitude has saved me from unnecessary surgeries and clarified errors in medical record keeping; both of which have a far greater chance of prolonging my life when compared to thinking happy thoughts. Through my work as an advocate for young cancer patients, I know many bereaved young spouses like Heidi and Caroline.  I think we do a disservice to their loved ones by perpetuating the myth that if you fight hard enough you can beat cancer.  If only it were that easy. //everythingchangesbook.com/ Just this morning I made a call to the ICU where my 92 year old father is a patient. The nurse who is caring for him picked up my call. I identified myself and she, without my request, told me the results of his lab test and what tests were going to happen today. As an RN with 44 years of experience, I was shocked, but I am surely not going to get my panties in a knot over the HIPPA factor. I follow HIPPA daily in my telephone advice nursing position. You’d never believe how many husbands want to know the results of their wife’s pregnancy tests and then flip out when I decline to give it to them.
Let’s return to the issue of Craig and the choices he made. He seemed like a very brave young man…there are so many…I just continue to wonder what is causing so much cancer.
//www.caringisnotenough.net Heidi emailed all of our family(Craigs) and friends to share  this article with us. The writer did have their permission and they anxiously awaited it to be printed. It was just sad that he wasnt able to view it himself. It was a wonderful article and I am glad she shared it with us all. Its too bad some of the comments people have left ruined some of the beauty of it! I thank all the wonderful nurses he had in Pittsburgh during these difficult times. It was comforting to know he had nurses like you that cared so much. Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
