 To the Editor: Re “In Hospice, Comfort and Care as Life Wanes” (Personal Health, Dec. 1): The families of dying patients described in Jane E. Brody’s column have one thing in common: They support their loved one’s wishes to be treated with dignity and not subjected to the miseries of aggressive care that does not change the outcome. People should let their families know what kind of measures they do and do not want when they are terminally ill or disabled. A family spokesperson will do far more than a piece of paper to ensure that their wishes are followed when they can’t speak for themselves. S. J. Fitzgibbons, M.D. Houston Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
