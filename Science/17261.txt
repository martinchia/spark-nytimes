                   If greens, raisins, nuts and grains of rice all symbolize prosperity, then you’ll do well to make this recipe for your New Year’s Eve party. Collard greens are great stuffing leaves; they are large and easy to work with, and they can stand up to long simmering. The filling is a typical Greek dolmades filling.
