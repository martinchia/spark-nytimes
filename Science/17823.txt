 Want to start a new running habit? We make it easy to get started, get inspired and stay on track. Are you ready? Letâs go!  Most people think of Thanksgiving as a day for food and family time. But for hundreds of thousands of people across the country, itâs also a day of running. Thanksgiving has become the biggest running day of the year. More than 786,000 runners crossed the finish line at Turkey Trot or other Thanksgiving Day race events in 2014. While the number was down slightly from the previous year, Thanksgiving race participation overall has increased 16 percent since 2011.  A Turkey Trot is typically a festive race on the shorter side — 3 to 6 miles — held on Thanksgiving morning. The races are often tied to fundraisers or food drives, may include costumes and almost always include a T-shirt with a trotting turkey. âWeâre seeing a trend in running that has become much more social and much less solitary,â said Rich Harshbarger, chief executive of Running USA, which collects data on race participation and running trends. âThanksgiving is a big family holiday. People say, âHey, before we go to the parade or have dinner, why donât a bunch of us enter?â â And of course, many people who run Turkey Trots are motivated by the meal they know is waiting for them at home. âAfter a workout or event of any kind people feel a sense of accomplishment,ââ said Mr. Harshbarger. âIt gives them the ability to say, âI can have that extra piece of pie. Iâve earned this meal.â” With about seven weeks left before Thanksgiving, today is the right day to start planning for your Turkey Trot.
