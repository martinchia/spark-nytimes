 To the Editor: Re “Bringing New Understanding to the Director’s Cut” (Basics, March 2): The work done by the Cornell psychologists in timing movie scenes from cut to cut and correlating that pace to neurological patterns misses the nature of film editing, which deals with the overall rhythm, pace, structure and flow of the film, and not just with the interval from cut to cut. By paying attention to the cuts only, they have neglected the basic rhythms of film. The give-away is the statement by a researcher who went through a film frame by frame and knew where every cut was but admitted, “I still haven’t seen the movie as a real filmgoer.” Michael Jorrin Ridgefield, Conn.
