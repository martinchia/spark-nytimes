 To the Editor: “An Ill Father, a Life-or-Death Decision” (Cases, Jan. 26) described an all too common situation: the tendency to avoid the emotional upset associated with sharing straightforward end-of-life information. The E.R. doctor told the author that her father would most likely not improve, but I had no sense that this information was conveyed to her father. Her father appeared to make his decision on the assumption that it would lead to improvement. The result was six months of intrusive and futile treatment.
