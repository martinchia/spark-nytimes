These hearty vegetarian meals in a bowl (or on a plate) are inspired by the Korean dish bibimbap. I call them âBig Bowlsâ because they are also inspired by a popular food truck Iâve eaten at, in Portland, Ore., whose only offering is called Whole Bowl, and is a comforting bowl of brown rice, with black beans, salsa, avocado and queso blanco. The long line of people I observed at this truck confirmed for me the fact that a simple, satisfying meal with grain, protein and terrific vegetables can be worth standing in line for.  Each dish this week consists of a combination of a whole grain and vegetable preparation, with protein in the form of tofu, beans or cheese. Sometimes the vegetables are as simple as cabbage kimchi, which I buy at Korean markets or at Trader Joeâs, accompanied by roasted red peppers and a delicious marinated, miso-glazed oven-baked tofu. Iâd be happy to accompany any vegetable with that tofu if the dish has Asian overtones. I used bean and vegetable combos to accommodate Mediterranean grains (farro, bulgur) in one of my Mediterranean bowls. And I made a delicious millet polenta, which I also accompanied with Mediterranean-style vegetables (eggplant, tomatoes, and chick peas in one dish, mushrooms in another). Feel free to mix and match, add a poached egg if you wish, or a salsa, or even some meat. But keep the focus on the grains and vegetables.

Farro or Bulgur With Black-Eyed Peas, Chard and Feta: A spiced up version of a classic Greek preparation: black-eyed peas cooked with greens. Red Rice or Farro With Miso-Roasted Squash, Leeks, Red Pepper and Tofu: One sweet-and-salty marinade works for the tofu and the vegetables in this dish.
