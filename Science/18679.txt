 I have in my pantry a rather large bag of dried barberries, bought at my Persian market, and I had been using them up slowly. Now I know where much of what remains of these sour, zingy vitamin C-rich dried fruits will go. 20 grams dried barberries (2 heaped tablespoons) 3 strips orange zest 1 or 2 slices orange 2 cloves 2 1/2 cups boiling water 2 teaspoons honey Place the dried barberries in a teapot or pyrex measuring cup. Add the orange zest, orange slices and cloves. Pour on the boiling water. Stir in the honey. Cover and allow the mixture to steep for 15 to 30 minutes. Strain and reheat gently if desired but do not boil. Yield: Serves 2 Advance preparation: You can keep this in the refrigerator for a day or two. Reheat but do not boil.
