Americaâs Next Top Model is going smoke-free. And itâs about time. A few months ago, I wrote an article criticizing the reality series starring supermodel Tyra Banks because it often showed beautiful, skinny women puffing away on cigarettes.  The program is watched by high numbers of preteen and adolescent girls, including my daughter. Regular exposure to smoking on television and in movies increases a child’s risk for trying cigarettes and becoming a smoker, studies show. Ms. Banks, along with co-executive producer Ken Mok, had assured me through a spokesman that they, too, were concerned about the impact the smoking models could have on young viewers.  Still, I had decided that if things didnât change on Top Model, our household was going to have to go Tyra-free. Last night, thankfully, things did change: America’s next top models became Americaâs next nonsmokers.  âThis is a no-smoking cycle,ââ Ms. Banks told the contestants, who live together and are eliminated one by one depending on their performance in various modeling activities. âSo many young girls are fans of Americaâs Next Top Model, and right now so many young girls are fans of you. If they see their idol puffing and smoking a cigarette, what does that make them think? Wow, she’s smoking, that’s cool. So that’s why smoking will be banned. It’s over.” The lecture came after an odd segment in which the girls were photographed holding cigarettes in glamorous poses. But then some startling graphics reflected the damage of smoking. The girls were shown coughing up blood, with facial tumors or tracheotomy holes in their necks, bald from chemotherapy and wrinkled from premature aging.  It seemed over-the-top to me, but then my daughter asked, with a look of disgust, âCan all that really happen to you if you smoke? All these things?ââ Even though weâve had many talks about the perils of smoking, I realized she didnât really understand until now how much damage smoking does to your body. âAll I knew before was that you could get cancer from it,ââ she said. âI didnât know you could get very ugly.ââ Comments are no longer being accepted. An unorthodox thing my father did cured me from ever wanting to smoke with my peers. When I was nine I was curious about a celebration cigar he had received from a friend who had a baby. Innocently he asked “Do you want to smoke this with me?” Excited to be doing something so grown up, I eagerly took a huge lungful of smoke. I coughed and hacked and felt like I was going to throw up. I was so mad at my dad I had a tantrum and started crying. I’m now 26 years old and have never smoked. I’m an embarrassingly avid fan of this show, and I’m glad ANTM is starting to think environmentally, health-consciously and in terms of social impact. This season, not only is Top Model going smoke free, they’re going green with additions like a new eco-friendly ride. In Model Life, Petra Nemcova had her girls planting trees in the park and thinking about community service. Glad to see Tyra following suit. While I applaud your efforts, been my observation from 40+ years in medicine, and raising 4 children, teens taking up smoking, drinking, drug taking or gambling are more closely linked to parental behavior. “I gave up cigarettes. But I didn’t give up SMOKIN’!” – Jake Blues Now that ANTM is smoke-free, our daughters can once again model themselves after idols who are painfully thin, petty, jealous, conniving, think their value as a human being depends upon what they wear…
America has taken a giant step backwards with so-called reality television.  It’s time to turn these programs off. Well if the author’s daughter said, “I didnât know you could get very uglyââ from smoking, then the show was not “over the top” as the author wrote but to the contrary, very effective.   Good job Tyra. âAll I knew before was that you could get cancer from it,ââ she said. âI didnât know you could get very ugly.ââ Cancer, no big deal, but God forbid someone become ugly from smoking… To the young lady who asks if all these can happen. Feel free to accompany your local clergy person to the hospital or nursing home and see the effects of smoking first hand. I have often wished I could take the young men and women who are smoking to see the ravages of this addiction that I see on a daily basis in my work. Ms. Parker Pope (and Ms. Banks, if you read this):  I work at a cancer center. I see what smoking does to people.  You are still wrong. If people want to smoke and increase their chances of death or disease, it is their business. Nannying grown people is for the birds. As regards kids, if they don’t pay more attention to health class, press reports, and all the other appropriate anti-smoking forces out there, then this is a form of natural selection: fools die young.  When or if the government outlaws smoking, that moment would be an appropriate time to ban models from smoking.  I find this especially pathetic coming from Tyra Banks, whose claims to support models who don’t look anorexic are belied by those who find success in her competition. If there is something that you should really wary about regarding the health of young girls who watch the show it is not tobacco consumption but the epidemic of EATING DISORDERS among young woman.  Eating Disorder comes easily while trying to emulate the glamorized super skinny MODELS but It may take a whole life to get rid of such disease I’m not a parent, I’m not a television watcher, and I certainly haven’t led any campaigns against smoking. I am, however, a firm believer on people taking action in the name of safety and responsibility; when we use our own foresight and communication, it’s another place that the government need not tread. Stewardship of the ideas and portrayals begins with us, not the government. Thanks to all parties involved for taking up that responsibility. Kudos to the author, and kudos to Ms. Banks. I did not see this segment, but I am glad that the show took a proactive stance against smoking. Responsible programming and parenting are both optional, but I’m glad that someone is doing it and not waiting for the “fools”, in this case kids, to eliminate themselves. I have been an on-and-off viewer of ANTM and commend Ms. Banks’ efforts. Not only has she taken two huge steps forward in banning smoking and “going green”, she has also tried to address the issues of racial monotony and too-skinny models by encouraging women of different backgrounds, ethnicities, and sizes to excel in the competition. I am still waiting to see “America’s Next Top Plus-Sized Model”, and it is true that every “plus-sized” (a disturbing categorization in its own right, I know) model has been eliminated along the way, but at least Ms. Banks has brought these issues to the attention of the young women and girls of America.  Also, did no one notice the inclusion of a beautiful young woman this season who is diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD? My teenaged daughter started smoking about 2 years ago after being offered a cigarette by someone.  I didn’t know about it for a long time because she hid it from me.  She ended up in a hospital with serious and painfullung surgery from smoking – at the ripe old age of 17.  We do not  know if she will require additional surgery, but it’s all a result of smoking.  This wasn’t cancer but another serious lung condition caused by smoking.  Teenagers think they don’t have to deal with the consequences of smoking until they are “old,” which can seem very far off.  My daughter learned that something very bad can happen very early – and this was a most painful experience, putting her in ICU, painful recovery, etc.  Ruined a long-planned and much-wanted vacation, too(she had to miss it). Also, she’s not sure, with a chronic lung condition now, if she can EVER fly again. I think it’s a good step. The information schools give out on things like smoking and STDs is so sanitized and watered down that it has little impact.  Many girls who want to model pick up smoking as an appetite supressant to help them stay thin.  There are many other problems in the industry too, but at least it’s a start. How many people do you know what started smoking when they were older than 19 or 20?  Anything we can do to take a away the appeal of cigarettes to teenagers (who have been shown to have physiological obstacles to good decision-making with regard to chemical stimuli) is a step in the right direction. “Makes you ugly” may be superficial, but it certainly makes an impact. If it works, why dispute it? I am glad that the show at least, for whatever reasons, figured out that they could influence the people watching this. I am outraged when I read a post from someone like joe above, who claims to work in a cancer center yet whose attitude towards smoking is ‘it is their fault’ (wanna bet he is a smoker?). Getting someone hooked on addictive substances is not something anyone should countenance, and anything that can be done should be to discourage smoking. By showing the effects of
smoking like that, maybe it will deter even one kid. Though to be honest, while I understand that young girls love dress up and such which is sort of what modelling is, I like others wonder about the image these models give young girls. Most of the models are way skinny, much less then average, and they give the impression that a girl has to be a diving board to be sexy or beautiful (just look at what happened when Tyra Banks put on a few pounds and actually looked human, you would have thought she killed a kid or something). I really would have a hard time letting a teenage or tween daughter watch this show, because it gives such a false image… Has anyone considered that going smoke-free is a design change by the producers intended to make audience members more comfortable in watching the show–translating to more advertising money? Think about it: Smoking bans are increasingly showing up in legislation in America. ANTM is almost certainly making money in some way from this ban. If a smoking ban doesn’t adversely affect the income of the show (or the outcome), it can only benefit them. Smokers on the show do not help to sell advertisements, and it does not get viewers to buy advertised products. Nix smoking, and suddenly it seems like a PR move–like Disney eliminating all smoke from their networks and old media. I imagine there is a fiscal reason for the decision. Whoever sponsored the “odd segment” for the anti-smoking campaign has the answer. Be realistic, poster #9. (Most) Kids pay more attention to TV than health class. As human beings we have the responsibility to help each other choose better, healthier ways of living instead of saying, “It’s your choice. Go ahead and get cancer and die.” I’m surprised by your attitude. I would think that one who sees cancer victims daily would be moved to help others prevent that sort of life. Nice move.  However, I think overall the show is negative.  Most women (beautiful or not) cannot be models–the era of the supermodel is over.  Even if they can be models, they do not make much money (some even work for free).  They are usually very very young, from 13-18 years old, and they are subject to an amazing amount of pressure and abuse due to low bargaining power.  It’s not a job girls should be thinking about, since it’s basically manual labor with a very prompt expiration date. I’d like to see better shows for young girls, as the current selection is disappointing. Ok, so I admit it, I love the show…but it has become increasingly clear to me that Tyra is becoming one of those scourges of psychology – the life coach.  With no training and no understanding of what she is doing, she blithely takes on all sorts of problems better left to TRAINED professionals.  Forcing a girl to quit smoking on national TV while she is in the midst of an incredibly emotionally stressful experience will most likely not help her quit in the long run, but will just be a bad experience that she will associate with quitting, causing her to put off trying to quit.  Frankly, Tyra needs to mind her own business and treat the show for what it is – a modeling competition. It’s true that eating disorders can be a serious problem among models and teenagers. However, cigarettes, not eating disorders, kill 1,200 Americans per day, and guess what…90% of those smokers started as teenagers.
Also, like it or not, TV influences teenagers. Of course teenagers are  educated more now than ever about the risks of smoking, yet they still smoke. If it takes Tyra showing the “ugly” side of smoking as opposed to the diseases that are associated with smoking to get the message across, then so be it! Whatever works!! It is a hard battle to fight! As a high school teacher, an advisor for my school’s anti-smoking club, and a relative of 10 family members who’s lives have been cut short from smoking, I have been fighting for a long time.
One more thing, to the idiot who said that its “natural selection” and “fools die young”… What the hell is wrong with you? Teenagers are not fools, they are teenagers. They may be naive, short-sighted,  and easily influenced by their peers, but they are not fools. The idiots at the tobacco companies who target their advertising to teenagers are the fools.
I would love for Tyra to come to my school and talk to our teens about smoking. Its about time that a celebrity is representin’!!!! Grown adults engaging in legal activity without coercion?
We cannot let this stand! Won’t someone think of the children? why not ban drinking too? for some reason our society has stigmatized one drug after another, yet alcohol remains untouchable… thousands of young kids are killed in drunk driving accidents every year, lives cut short in their prime, not from lung cancer 40 years later.  I supposed this is a step forward for the anti-smoking campaigns, albeit on a reality TV show, but it’s not a solution.  I don’t expect much from Tyra Banks, but this whole charade is ridiculous to me.  We should be encouraging our youth to make smart, educated decisions, not giving them ultimatums and restricting their personal liberties.  just pointing out the hypocrisy. Suzanne- I would also like to think that alcohol should be considered more of a threat, but the problem lies in the past.  Alcohol has always been socially acceptable and when the government finally did make it illegal, a whole new slew of problems arose.  This was essentially what started organized crime and led to corruption in our government and local authorities.  Therefore I agree with your assesment that we need to increase our education of all things negative and reach parents and teachers to take a more active role than they currently do, and not leave it up to prime time television to do so. Hollywood movies recruit almost 400,000 new teen smokers every year. Independent researchers in the U.S., Germany, Mexico and New Zealand have run large-scale, peer-reviewed studies and arrived at the same conclusion â the tobacco companies that invested millions to get tobacco on screen knew exactly what they were doing.  How does smoking get on TV shows produced or broadcast by the same media companies that own the major movie studios? Who knows. The important thing is to get it off â and viewers writing in will do it.  Congratulations to everybody involved in taking Tyra’s show smokefree.
