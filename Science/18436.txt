Most of us eat lettuce cold, as a salad or a crispy fresh topping on a sandwich or burger. But in this week’s Recipes for Health, Martha Rose Shulman turns up the heat on lettuce, putting the crispy greens in a stir-fry, a hot soup, a warm sauce and a cooked bean dish. And for traditionalists, she’s also offered a cold salad. I decided to devote most of the recipes this week to dishes that involve cooking lettuce. I couldnât resist one simple romaine and radish salad, but the rest of the dishes are cooked. I used the tough outer leaves of romaine or leaf lettuce in blended sauces and entire heads in soups. I tested several classic French braised lettuce recipes, but as promising as these looked on paper, they didnât appeal to me nearly as much as the more vibrant Chinese stir-fried lettuce dishes I tried, or the purÃ©ed soups. In the French braised dishes, the life seemed to be cooked out of the lettuces. I used sturdy lettuces like romaine and leaf lettuce for the cooked dishes, not tender spring mixes, which really should be dedicated to salads. Bitter lettuces with tough outer leaves, like curly endive (a k a escarole or chicory) and Batavia, stand up to cooking the same way greens like kale do. Use the recipes not only when you have a surfeit of lettuce in your C.S.A. basket, but also for the tough outer leaves of the one head of romaine in your fridge that you donât want to include in your salads.  Here are five new ways to enjoy lettuce, hot and cold. Green Mole With Chicken: A warm sauce featuring tomatillos and lettuce gives tender poached chicken a Mexican accent. Stir-Fried Lettuce With Seared Tofu and Red Pepper: If youâve got too much lettuce on hand, put the salad dressing away and try stir-frying it. Romaine and Radish Salad With Buttermilk Lemon Dressing: A tangy, creamy dressing cuts the bite of the radishes and the mild bitterness of the romaine. White Beans With Chicory: PurÃ©ed fava beans and cooked chicory are a classic pairing in Italy; for this version, almost any kind of hearty bitter lettuce will work. Lettuce and Green Garlic Soup: Use a flavorful broth â chicken or vegetable â to enhance the subtle flavors in this thick, comforting soup.
