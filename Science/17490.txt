 Premature babies may be aware of pain in much the same way as older children and adults, according to a British study. The experience of pain requires higher-level activity in the brain's cortex, and some have suggested that infants, particularly premature ones, process a noxious stimulus only at the spinal or brainstem level. But using a device that measures blood flow in the brain, researchers showed that even in the most premature babies pain is processed in the cortex, just as in adults. The work was published April 5 in The Journal of Neuroscience. The scientists tested 18 infants  ranging  from 25 to 45 weeks after the mother's last menstrual period, placing sensors on the head to record brain blood flow during heel lancing for a blood sample.

Nonpainful tactile stimulation like tickling of the bottom of the foot, did not evoke a change in cortical blood flow. Despite the identical brain activity, differences remain in the ways babies and older children experience pain, said Maria Fitzgerald, the study's senior author and a professor of developmental neurobiology at University College London.

What we show is that the youngest babies have a pure sensory response, but we cannot assume that they interpret it or analyze it in the same way."
