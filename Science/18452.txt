The companies that make high-fructose corn syrup want to pick a new name for the sweetener, so we’re asking Well readers to help. We asked a panel of nutrition experts what they thought about the term “corn sugar,” which is the name suggested by the Corn Refiners Association. We also asked them to offer their own ideas. Read what they have to say and then vote on your favorite, or write in your own sweet suggestion in the Comments box, below. Corn Glucose and Fructose Syrup: Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition at New York University and author of “Food Politics,” says these five words sum up the ingredient. She writes: It is not corn sugar. The Food and Drug Administration already has a definition for that, and itâs just glucose (dextrose). High-fructose corn syrup does come from corn. Itâs made by extracting the starch from corn, treating it with enzymes to make glucose, and treating the glucose with other enzymes to turn about half of it into fructose. And it comes as a syrup, not crystals. So from a chemical standpoint, “corn glucose and fructose syrup” is exactly what it is. I also like it because it conveys the idea that this is a processed sweetener. Enzymatically Altered Corn Glucose: Michael Pollan, author of “The Omnivore’s Dilemma,” which takes a critical look at the food business, says EACG is a more accurate description. He explains: The name also connotes a highly-processed, novel food ingredient, which has always been the best reason to avoid it: not because it is necessarily worse for you than sugar, but because it is a marker for a whole class of processed foods we’d do well to keep out of our diet. Glucose-Fructose Corn Sweetener: Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, says the name is similar to the term “glucose-fructose syrup,” which is used in Canada. High-fructose corn syrup is no higher in fructose than regular sugar, and “corn sugar” sounds like it is sugar that comes directly out of corn.  Both terms are misleading. “Glucose-fructose corn sweetener,” a term used abroad, may not be pretty, but it’s more accurate. Corn Sugar: Barry Popkin, director of the University of North Carolina Interdisciplinary Obesity Center and an advocate for taxes on sugared beverages, says the simple name works. Frankly I feel that corn sugar is perfect. A large amount of research on this topic of fructose versus HFCS has shown that fructose in any sugar — be it cane sugar, beet sugar, or sugar from corn or many other sources — has the same adverse additional effects on health. But the major negative is any sugar consumed in a beverage. For this reason corn sugar, as well as ânatural sugar,â which is either from sugar cane, beet sugars or fruit juice concentrates, all have fructose and all have the same adverse effects on health. Corn sugar clearly identifies correctly sugar from corn as not having more fructose than any other sugar source. High-Fructose Corn Syrup: Dr. Andrew Weil, best-selling author and alternative medicine pioneer, says no name change is needed. He says: I don’t like  âcorn sugar” — too vague — and traditionally it meant solid dextrose (glucose) made by hydrolyzing cornstarch. I’m in favor of sticking with âhigh-fructose corn syrup.” That’s what it is, and I don’t agree that it’s innocuous. It’s a cheap sweetener, a marker of low-quality  industrial food and a major promoter of insulin resistance and obesity in our population.

Barry Popkin appears to be repeating the company line.  Haven’t I read more than once here on Well that researchers are finding ways that the human body processes HFCS differently from cane sugar? It should be called “Corn Glufru”. I don’t want to get all picky-picky, but why are you doing this? Corn Sugar sounds almost wholesome. Everyone who’s ever run a still has heard of corn and sugar. The rest? How many people do you think can actually explain the difference between Glucose and Fructose in the first place? George Carlin’s bit about how “shell shock” became “post-traumatic stress disorder” comes to mind. Enzymatically Altered Corn Glucose (15 syllables)
Glucose-Fructose Corn Sweetener (8 syllables)
Corn Glucose and Fructose Syrup (8 syllables)
High-Fructose Corn Syrup (5 syllables) Call it “poison.” Explain how the body processes it and explain how it leads to obesity. Don’t make light of HFCS. I saw a TV commercial for Corn Sugar yesterday. So, haven’t they already chosen this as the new name? I suggest “Liquid death.” What a terrible waste of the public and nutrition experts’ time! Of course the companies that make high-fructose corn syrup want a new name: their unhealthy sweetener is becoming too infamous as we learn more and more about it! Surely their profits have taken some hit as a result of the negative publicity. They would love to change the name now and just confuse everyone so that we have a harder time making the right decisions about our food and nutrition. 1- corporate welfare sugar
2- millionaire’s elixir
3- tax payer subsidized corporate sugar
4- S.U.G.A.R – corporate ceo saying “sure u get a refund” right into my pocket give me a break…this “sugar” is only competitive on the market because it is subsidized in the farm bill and through other incentives. AND we wonder why junk food is so cheap AND americans keep getting fatter….. Who cares what it’s called, either way people are going to know what it is. To davehalo please stop blaming obesity on this stuff. It’s getting pretty old, check out //www.diet-myths.com  Read their article Why does Mexico have an obesity problem when they don’t use the stuff…? They should call it:
 “Don’t be fooled by our lame attempt to cloak this unhealthy substance for what it is” syrup. F-A-T (Fat American Tonic) Remove it from the “Dictionary” Crappo. Corn Renamed As Practically, Perfectly Okay. It should be called toxic waste.  End of discussion. Corn sugar makes it sound natural so of course they want to use that. Processed corn sugar might be okay with me. I’ll just learn to look for whatever they call it though, and still avoid it. Sugar High fructose corn syrup is a Manufactured Ingestible that threatens the health and wellbeing of the unwary.
Beware of Entertainment “foods” that make profits for the the stockholders of the companies that make and market them and the stockholders of pharmaceutical companies that manufacture and market the medicines to treat diabetes, obesity, hypertension, etc. It already has a name and it’s a good name. Compared to regular corn sugar it has been made artificially high in fructose, hence high-fructose corn syrup. We aren’t really confused, are we? Ban it… or at least ban it from foods that are supposedly “healthy”, “fit”, or at least reasonable like: bread, breakfast cereal, yoghurt, muesli bars, etc etc When I moved to the States, I gained a huge amount of kilos (pounds over here) by eating like back home. When eating less and exercising did not help, I asked a few doctors and med students. The cause: all the S*** that’s hidden in the foods. So now, I read the ingredients in every package when I shop and BOYCOTT (i.e.: don’t buy and suggest that friends & others do the same) anything that has:
– high-fructose corn syrup (you won’t believe in how many foods they manage to put it in…)
– more than 5 ingredients on the package. This has made my shopping more difficult and expensive, but seems the only way to eat a decently healthy diet on this “free” market, where the corporations are free to put any s*** in the food. And that includes only the little they’re COMPELLED TO LABEL. I was going to suggest “Corn-Derived Poison,” but I think S. L. Marshall and “Liquid Death” can’t be beat. Wow,  this is an absolute shame.  The title of this article should be “High Fructose Damage Control” or Companies Struggle to Change Poor HFCS Image.” Let’s get real here for a moment, shall we? HFCS is absolute garbage and one on the many reasons Americans are so damn fat and lazy. Fortunately for food manufacturers, it’s insanely cheap to process from corn rather than use actual sugar.  So here we are reading and responding to the NON NEWS that companies are freaking out because the image of HFCS has been so badly tainted. Thats the real issue here. Sorry Monsanto, you’re going to lose this battle in the long run. People are slowly waking up to this crap and feeling more entitled to healthy alternatives to processed convenience foods.  I feel bad for the poor people who can’t make better decisions due to finances. Just rename it “Glutton syrup,” “Overeaters delight” or “American way,” any would be fitting. The media as usual, is its own worst enemy.  By placing pressure on non-issues like this those of us who are wise to whats going on in our food are hip to remember who gave us the clues. This won’t be the last you hear of HFCS. Just look for a name change and stealthy placement on new labels and/or an upcoming court ruling that says it doesn’t have to be listed at all. Sickening… I agree with Pollan. I think the key is that corn sugar, corn syrup or high fructose corn syrup, however you name it, is a beacon that the food is overly processed and therefore has little nutritional value. Not to mention that many people like the taste of real sugar better.  Ever had a Mexican coke? Tastes better and significantly different than our American hfcs version. There are some great alternatives to high fructose corn syrup  products out there if you look hard enough. Check out the growing reference of products at thesugardiet.com, including corn syrup-free Halloween candy. high subsidy corn syrup? I can’t help but wondering if the reason that it was named High-Fructose Corn Syrup in the first place was to create an air of being something different to sugar (which was getting a bad wrap) – maybe even a healthier choice than sugar. Now it is High-Fructose Corn Syrup that has a bad wrap they want to change the name so people who have decided not to consume it may consume it under a different name. I say stick with the name as it is. If it is changed, they for several years after the name change, the lable should read “bla die bla – formerly known as High-Fructose Corn Syrup” Regardless of whether High-Fructose Corn Syrup deserves its bad name or not, people have a right ot know what they are buying. Does anyone know where the name came from originally and why it was chosen? FROM TPP — The name was chosen to distinguish it from regular corn syrup, which is 100% glucose. So even though the corn syrup was only 42 to 55% fructose, compared to regular corn syrup it was considered a high fructose corn syrup. So that became the name. Corn syrup is CORPORATE WELFARE. U.S. ag programs use taxpayer money to provide an oversupply of grain and keep prices as low as possible–this hurts farmers but benefits big companies like ADM. ADM takes this subsidized grain and turns it into subidized ethanol and corn syrup—which would be too expensive if not for our import quotas and price support programs which keep U.S. sugar prices much higher than in the rest of the world. U.S. consumers/taxpayers are getting stuck at both ends, we subsidize the grain, we subsidize what it’s turned into and wind up paying for it all in higher taxes AND higher food and gas prices. Corn sryup is nothing but CORPORATE WELFARE. my sweet suggestion:- HiPro Liquid Sweetner Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
