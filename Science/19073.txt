Beets are a fall favorite on Well. We’ve put them in smoothies, lasagna and spring rolls. We’ve tried to convert beet skeptics and even let our readers eat beet cake. This week in Recipes for Health, Martha Rose Shulman offers a new crop of beet dishes for breakfast and dinner. (Yes, beets for breakfast!) Check out these five new ways to enjoy beets. Spinach Salad With Red and Chioggia Beets, Quinoa and Walnuts: This is one of those salads where the grain enhances texture and adds a nutritional punch, but isnât what the salad is about. 
Stir-Fried Beet Greens, Tofu and Beets: A stir-fry that takes advantage of the greens as well as the beets. Shredded Beet and Radish Slaw With Rice Noodles: A salad that can stand alone, or make a great filling for spring rolls. Beet and Chia Pancakes: These pink pancakes are great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Seared Fish With Beet Salsa:  A salsa that pairs well with fish or grains.
