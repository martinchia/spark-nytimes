And lately, neither has South Africa, which has been using poison to eradicate crows that are considered a threat to other species.  But Arjun Amar, an ornithologist at the Percy FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology in Cape Town, wasn’t convinced that the crows were quite so dangerous. “The research really hadn’t been done,” he said. “There was a gap in the literature, so we decided to see what the real impact was.”  Dr. Amar and two other researchers collected more than 40 studies on corvids and their effect on prey species. They divided the results into two categories: the effect that corvids have on the abundance of other species (the overall population) and their effect on productivity (nest success and brood size.) They found that in 81 percent of cases, corvids had no negative influence on the abundance or productivity of other birds. In cases where they did have an effect, they were far more likely to affect productivity without affecting abundance, meaning that even when they destroyed significant numbers of eggs or young birds, it had little long-term effect on the number of animals. “We do see crows eating chicks and eggs, but it doesn’t translate into long-term losses,” Dr. Amar said. “When you remove crows, it doesn’t translate to more birds in the environment.” The most likely explanation, said the study, which was published in the journal Ibis, was that the birds killed by corvids would probably have starved anyway, or would have been killed by other predators that swoop in when corvids aren’t present.
