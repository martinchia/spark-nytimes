 This week, scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., noticed an enormous school of anchovies gathering near the coast. Pressed into a huge swarm, an estimated one billion of the tiny fish are taking cues from their neighbors, carefully coordinating their every move. The researchers do not know why this school is so large and so close to shore. But small fish typically aggregate into schools to foil large predators. “It offers some protection,” said H.J. Walker, manager of the marine vertebrates collection at Scripps. “It’s a good way to disrupt predators that would normally chase down one individual fish.” This particular swarm consists of  northern anchovies, close relatives of Peruvian anchovies, which are known for their vast schools.

For jack fish, schooling is less about protection and more about finding a suitable mate. Certain ocean predators, like bluefin tuna, have developed methods for exploiting large schools of fish. When the tuna close in on the school of mackerel in the video below, the tiny fish form a towering, roiling bait ball. The tuna, however, do not seem to be all that intimidated. Mr. Walker noted that the ocean off Southern California was unusually warm this week, but said that it was too early to say whether that played a role in the anchovy swarm.
