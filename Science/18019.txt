 To the Editor: Re “A Thief That Robs the Brain of Language” (Personal Health, May 3): I was disappointed that Jane Brody did not mention the existence of speech-assistive devices that enable users to individualize words and phrases that refer to the person’s particular needs and, when touched, will speak for the user. Additionally, there are also devices that respond to eye gaze or blinks for people who are not able to point and touch. I believe Medicare will cover these devices. I do know, from personal experience, that the device can be rented on a trial basis for a month with Medicare coverage. Barbara R. Rauch New York Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
