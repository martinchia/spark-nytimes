Most people with diabetes are treated with drugs (notably metformin) that donât put them at risk of unusually low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, a potentially dangerous side effect. But as patients age and develop other chronic medical conditions, it becomes more difficult for them to tolerate these medications. So doctors often switch older diabetes patients to insulin or a class of medications known as sulfonylureas. (Brand names include Glucotrol, Amaryl, and Diabinese.) With these drugs, hypoglycemia becomes a more serious concern. When doses of insulin or sulfonylurea drugs are too high, an older personâs blood sugar can plunge, depriving the brain of oxygen and leading to collapse, loss of consciousness, and even death. But calculating how much medication a patient should get and on what schedule isnât always easy. For older adults, the process can be complicated by erratic meals, vision loss, depression, dementia and other difficulties with self-care. A recent study in JAMA Internal Medicine, by researchers at the Department of Veterans Affairs, notes that among adults aged 65 and older, insulin and sulfonylurea drugs are âthe second most common medications associated with emergency department visits or hospitalizations and adverse drug events.â Thatâs just the tip of the iceberg, experts believe.  How common is overtreatment of diabetes and the related risk of hypoglycemia in the older population? No one is sure, but the new study provides an important clue. The researchers identified patients within the V.A. system at risk of developing hypoglycemia because of their age (75 years and older), cognitive impairment and impaired kidney function. Then they looked at a measure of blood sugar control known as the A1C hemoglobin test. About 206,000 of these patients had received therapy that was significantly more aggressive than recommended under V.A. diabetes guidelines, the investigators found. Although those guidelines suggest that an A1C score of 8 to 9 percent is adequate for patients with limited life expectancies and other major illnesses, about half had scores below 7 percent, and more than one in 10 had scores below 6 percent. The findings indicate that a large number of elderly veterans with diabetes âare potentially being overtreated based on the most recent professional society and federal agency guidelines,â the authors wrote. Dr. Patrick OâMalley, division director of general internal medicine at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, called the results âscary,â and said they âchallenge the current paradigm that emphasizes tight control of blood sugar for diabetes patients.â âWhile normalizing blood sugar sounds like itâs the right thing to do, hypoglycemia is much more dangerous in the short term than hyperglycemiaâ for older patients, he added.
