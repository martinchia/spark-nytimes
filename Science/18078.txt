 The banded stilt, a graceful, nomadic water bird found in inland salt lakes in Australia, can somehow sense and move toward rainfall hundreds of miles away. Australians often spot the birds within days of rainfall, said Reece Pedler, a biologist at Deakin University in Australia. And then, abruptly, the birds will disappear. The mystery, he said, is “How do these birds know when to leave one place for another, and how do they do it so fast?” To better understand the movements of the nomadic birds, Mr. Pedler and his colleagues tagged 21 banded stilts with satellite transmitters. Their findings appear in the journal Biology Letters. Advertisement One tagged bird flew to a saline wetland more than 1,000 miles in less than two and a half days. Another bird took six days but ended up in the same area. Other tagged birds made overnight flights of about 200 to 400 miles. The banded stilts are interesting because their movements are so sudden and unpredictable. While many other birds migrate, Mr. Pedler said, most do it seasonally, “on a predictable time scale, and have time to plan, prepare and adjust flight-muscle mass.” Advertisement Exactly how the banded stilts know when and where to travel is still a mystery, he said, but the satellite trackers provide important details about their gypsylike movements.
