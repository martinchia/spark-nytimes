 About 175 million years ago, the ancestors of today’s snakes and lizards probably gave birth to live young, researchers reported last week in Ecology Letters. The finding counters a long-held belief that the 2,000 or so species of snakes and lizards that give live birth evolved only recently, said Alex Pyron, a biologist at George Washington University. Dr. Pyron and Frank T. Burbrink of the City University of New York used DNA sequencing to create an evolutionary tree of more than 4,000 snake and lizard species. They discovered that today’s live-bearing snakes and lizards belong to earlier, more ancient branches of the evolutionary tree. Over the millenniums, the researchers also found, many species have vacillated between laying eggs and giving live birth, and climate has been important in driving the switch. In colder times, snakes and lizards seem to favor live birth. Even today, the viviparous, or common, lizard lays eggs in Southern Europe but gives live birth farther north in Scandinavia. “Eggs don’t do so well in colder climates,” Dr. Pyron said. A version of this article appears in print on December 24, 2013, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Evolution: The Old Snake-and-Egg Question.
