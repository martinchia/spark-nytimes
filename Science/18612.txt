 If you are among the roughly 20 percent of people who regularly get cold sores, you can now blame your genes, researchers say. The virus that causes most such sores, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), is found in as many as 9 out of 10 people, and scientists have long wondered why only a minority get the sores. To study the problem, researchers from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland analyzed thousands of genes to see which ones were responsible for making the protein that prevents the virus from becoming active. Having identified several genes, the researchers then looked for them in the blood samples of 20 people with cold sores. They found that one of the genes, IL28B, was consistently mutated in people who got sores. The mutated gene is unable to produce the necessary protein, leaving the body’s immune system unable to fend off the sores, said the researchers, writing in the journal PLoS Pathogens. The insight suggests a possible treatment route not just for cold sores but other infections caused by HSV-1, said Dr. Jürgen Haas, a professor of viral genomics at the University of Edinburgh and an author of the study. “In cold sores you can use acyclovir,” he said, referring to a common treatment for several herpes conditions, “but the same virus also causes more severe infections of the brain, the eyes and the genital tract.” In cases where acyclovir is ineffective, he said, a treatment involving IL28B might be used.
