 To the Editor: Re “No Extra Benefits Are Seen in Stents for Coronary Artery Disease” (Feb. 28): Commenting on his own research study, Dr. David Brown suggests that interventional cardiologists perform angioplasty procedures, with or without stents, in patients with stable coronary artery disease because of pressure from hospitals to generate more revenue. This assertion is not supported by any evidence. I cannot speak for Dr. Brown’s experience. But in the 20 years that I have been at St. Francis Hospital, the administration has never asked a doctor to do anything other than what he or she believes to be in patients’ best interest. Furthermore, I believe our position with respect to coronary angioplasty, or any other procedure, is representative of a vast majority of American hospitals.   Alan D. Guerci, M.D. Roslyn, N.Y.
