 Q. What are the little worms that appear in flour, rice and cereals? Are they related to the tiny black bugs that also show up? How do they get there? A. They are different pests, said Carolyn Klass, senior extension associate in the department of entomology at Cornell University, and while they may be present in the products when they are bought, they could also  have spread there from an existing kitchen infestation. In the Northeastern United States, the worms probably represent the larval stage of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella,  Ms. Klass said. The beetles are probably the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, or the confused flour beetle, Tribolium confusum. Another beetle, the saw-toothed grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis, is more common in pastas and ground flours than in whole grains, she said. Scrupulously cleaning, sometimes repeatedly, will usually get rid of these pests, Ms. Klass said. First, throw the infested product out. Then check all exposed foods for creatures that may already have spread there; even if you don’t see any, put the foods back in tightly closed see-through containers to be sure. Clean the cabinets and vacuum the seams, as well as the angles where the walls meet the ceiling, which may harbor moth cocoons. Meal moth traps with pheremones, synthetic hormones that attract the males, can reduce the problem after cleanup but won’t cure it, she said.
