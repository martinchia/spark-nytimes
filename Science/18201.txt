 Small crabs found on California’s shores may be capable of adapting to a warming climate, but the effort will leave them little energy for tasks like growth and reproduction, researchers are reporting. For their study, which appears in The Journal of Experimental Biology, the scientists collected samples of the porcelain crab called Petrolisthes cinctipes and exposed them to different conditions in the laboratory, varying carbon dioxide levels by injecting seawater with gas. “When you bubble the water with CO2 it creates an acid and causes a drop in pH,” said an author of the study, Jonathon Stillman, an environmental physiologist at San Francisco State University. “That’s what ocean acidification does.” The scientists also varied the temperature in the lab. As it rose and pH levels dropped, the crabs’ ability to withstand heat increased. But at the same time, their metabolism dropped and they became more sluggish.

The crabs belong to a genus of about 100 species of porcelain crabs, around 50 of which are found all the way from Alaska to Chile; P. cinctipes live under rocks and mussel beds from British Columbia to Santa Barbara, Calif. And while humans do not consume them, they are an important source of food for birds, small fish and other crabs.
