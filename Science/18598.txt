Two researchers from the Pliomax team – Michael J. O’Leary, in rear, from Australia’s Curtin University, and Alessio Rovere, from Columbia University – explore an ancient rock formation along the coast of South Africa. This particular formation dates to a period about 120,000 years ago when the earth was warmer and sea level was higher than today. CreditJustin Gillis/The New York Times 1 of 11
