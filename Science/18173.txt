 To the Editor: “An Enduring Measure of Fitness: The Simple Push-Up” (Well, March 11) gave me a lift. I have been doing push-ups all my life, although with less regularity as I get older. Every so often when I feel the lethargy of being a couch potato I will do some push-ups and I feel renewed. The idea that you’re just using your own body and your body’s weight and getting strength from that is effective. The fact that it may help me if I fall is even more incentive.  Steven A.
