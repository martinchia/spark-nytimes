 It came down with a crash and a flash. A camera on a floating platform in the Atlantic Ocean captured this remarkably successful failure, as the Space Exploration Technologies Corp. of Hawthorne, Calif., or SpaceX, attempted to land the first stage of one of its Falcon 9 rockets. The rocket had just successfully lofted cargo to the International Space Station. Typically, rockets are tossed away as trash in the ocean. Had the effort succeeded, it might have heralded an era of reusable rockets and much cheaper launchings. Still, just hitting a 170-foot-by-300 foot target in the middle of the ocean was significant progress. Elon Musk, SpaceX’s chief executive, on Friday posted on Twitter a series of pictures and video taken as the rocket stage neared the landing pad. Space News reported on the images Friday morning. Fins that were guiding the descent ran out of hydraulic fluid after about four minutes, and the rocket engines were not able to compensate, Mr. Musk reported. The rocket stage hit the deck of the ship at a 45-degree angle, causing an explosion as the residual oxygen and fuel in the rocket combusted — “full RUD (rapid unscheduled disassembly),” as Mr. Musk tweeted.

Exciting day! pic.twitter.com/tIEctHFKHG  The next landing attempt would occur in two to three weeks, on the next launching of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, Mr. Musk said, and SpaceX will load 50 percent more hydraulic fluid. "At least it shd explode for a diff reason,” Mr. Musk tweeted. We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think. Go to Home Page »
