 To the Editor: Re “Crusaders for Quality, a Health-Care Intangible” (Books, July 29): Hubris or not, doctors speak from experience when they suggest that quality in health care is not the same as quality in cars or televisions or any other inanimate object. “Quality” is a term imposed by health insurers who are used to dealing with faceless graphics and numbers. They cannot and never will understand the human dimensions that enter into every interaction that doctors have with their patients. Save “quality” for inanimate objects.   There is good care, mediocre care and poor care. Quality care is a myth. Edward J. Volpintesta, M.D.Bethel, Conn. Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
