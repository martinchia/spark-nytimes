Looking for a new staple for your pantry? Try bulgur, suggests Martha Rose Shulman in this week’s Recipes for Health. It comes in four different grades â fine (#1), medium (#2), coarse (#3), and very coarse (#4)â and each type lends itself to a particular kind of dish. In the Middle East pilafs are made with medium, coarse, and very coarse bulgur. Tabbouleh and kibbe are made with fine bulgur. In my kitchen I use the medium grind for a delicious breakfast porridge that has the flavor of a hearty cream of wheat, and I add it to breads and other baked goods. Coarse bulgur goes into pilafs and soups, casseroles and stuffed vegetables. I donât know if bulgur is going to be the next quinoa â probably not, as these days so many people shun wheat. But if I had to choose one over the other for flavor and versatility, Iâd go with bulgur. One thing it has going for it is that it can be reconstituted without cooking, though you can also cook it in boiling water (the grains will be a little fluffier if you do). As for the nutritional profile, whereas quinoa has a little more protein (4 grams per 100 grams of grain compared with bulgurâs 3), bulgur is less caloric (83 calories per 100 grams compared with quinoaâs 120), higher in fiber (4 grams versus 3), slightly lower in carbohydrates (19 grams compared with 21) and sodium (5 mg compared with 7).  Here are five new ways to enjoy bulgur.
