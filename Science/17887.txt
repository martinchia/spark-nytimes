I wonder if Peter is breaking up with me. Oh, everything was great the last time we met. He definitely said weâd get together again. He said heâd call me. Then something came up that I really needed to talk to him about, so I called him. Then I called him again, then I left a voice message, called again, sent an email, sent another one â and nothing. Peter is ghosting me, and I donât know what to do. I could maintain my dignity by forgetting him and moving on. I could confront him on his doorstep like a smitten adolescent. Neither alternative really works, as Peter is my patient, and this is all about his cholesterol. He and I have been here before, and yes, we donât see eye to eye on lipid management. But I just got his new numbers back, and we really need to talk. Maybe I came on too strong and scared him. I do that. Or maybe heâs on vacation. But wouldnât he take his phone with him? Wait, maybe weâre on a break! Unlike most stuck in this cycle of second-guessing, doctors do have legitimate ways of finding people when we need them urgently, venerable tactics like the telegram, the next of kin and the police. We use these blunt instruments periodically to break through the wall of silence when contact is a matter of life or death. Some alarming lab result is usually responsible. In theory, people who are sick enough to generate alarming results have been treated pre-emptively or sent to the hospital, but sometimes the lab delivers a big surprise. It was only a few years ago, during a weekend on call, that I was forced into a series of early Sunday morning conversations with the desk sergeant at a Bronx precinct house. A man who lived in that neighborhood, one of our patients, had blood drawn on Friday morning. By Saturday evening, the samples were growing enough bad bacteria to confirm that he had a serious problem. But he had been sent home from our clinic, he wasnât answering his phone, and he had no next of kin. I envisioned him flat on the floor. The sergeant was kind enough to send a patrol car to his door, then reported back that our patient was alive and well, or at least well enough to decline to open the door and to tell the officers in emphatic terms to remove themselves. They conveyed my message (âcome in at onceâ) before they drove away, and the patient, unimpressed, showed up on Tuesday to be ushered to a hospital bed, apparently none the worse for the delay. For circumstances short of life threatening, however, this method is really not an option. Sometimes the tests show that patients have conditions that may not be immediately dire but place others at risk. Then we can ask the Department of Health to take over the job. For flushing out people with newly identified syphilis or tuberculosis, nothing beats a health department gumshoe with a name and address. But for patients like Peter, with his alarming cholesterol, we are on our own. These people are not sick (not yet). They are not contagious. They are simply missing in action, and of course they have every right to be just that. They are also allowed to ignore lab results that are displayed on their electronic charts in bright red type with exclamation points. They can ignore these results for a day, a week, a year, a lifetime. They can go elsewhere in hopes of different results. They can run (as I believe I pointed out to Peter at one point â OMG, I should never have said that!), but they generally canât hide. Unfortunately, every bit of the ambiguity that the answering machine, the cellphone and voice mail have brought to social interactions also afflicts medical interactions. When somebodyâs phone just keeps ringing, the path is clear: We keep trying. But when the messages accumulate, then, like the lovelorn, we begin to obsess. A spectrum of explanations is possible, from a desperately sick patient to a patient who has not yet figured out his voice mail to a patient who has waltzed merrily off in a better doctorâs arms. There are no protocols. After several messages, some of us quit, while some keep trying. But eventually even the purest medical concern slowly morphs into stalking. We become doctors without borders, boundaries or common sense. As one of my patients once muttered about a previous doctor, the woman didnât know when to stop. I donât want to be one of those women. Iâm cool. Still, Peter, if youâre reading this, Iâm pretty sure we can work things out. Call me, O.K.?
