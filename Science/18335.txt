 To the Editor: Re “Food Revolution That Starts With Rice” (June 17): We were disappointed to read your profile of Norman Uphoff and the System of Rice Intensification (S.R.I.). The tone of the article endorses the view that Mr. Uphoff is re-inventing global rice agriculture through simple management innovations. Can S.R.I. improve average farmer yields? Certainly, as do all similar, long established interventions that promote precise planting, good weed control, and ample soil fertility. Does it offer unique yield advantages over current recommendations for rice? The scientific answer is clearly no. Moreover, studies in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu and elsewhere indicate that S.R.I. is ill-suited to the needs of small farmers and is not widely adopted. Will science, rather than attractive narratives such as S.R.I., play a critical role in addressing the world food crisis? Absolutely.
