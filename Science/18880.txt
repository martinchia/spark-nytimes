Today Well reintroduces its popular fitness training tool, Run Well, which allows readers to choose among several free running plans for long and short distances from some of the country’s top running coaches.   Today we’ve upgraded the tool to include additional training plans for half marathons, 10Ks and a 5K. Now Run Well offers shorter-distance plans from Michael Conlon and Jasmine Graham, running coaches for the New York chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society’s Team in Training, the worldâs largest endurance sports training program. The Olympian Jeff Galloway also offers plans ranging from a 5K to a marathon using his run-walk method, which is ideal for beginners, people who are overweight and even experienced runners who have been struggling and want to try something new. And Danny Dreyer, a running coach and author of the “Chi Running” book series, offers his training plan based on the âintelligent movementâ principles of tai chi. The tool still contains all the original marathon training plans for beginners and intermediate and experienced runners. Other Run Well coaches who have contributed plans include Greg McMillan, an internationally recognized distance coach and exercise physiologist who specializes in helping time-oriented runners reach their race goals; Grete Waitz, who won the New York City Marathon a record nine times and was an author of âRun Your First Marathonâ; and Bob and Shelly Glover, creators of the official training program for the New York Road Runners and the New York City Marathon. We hope you’ll check out the Run Well training tool, try a training plan and give us your feedback. Each week, Well will support your efforts with articles filled with training advice and news from your favorite runners. Whether your goal is a marathon, a half marathon, a 10K or just getting off the couch to try a 5K, we hope you will join our efforts to get moving and run well.
