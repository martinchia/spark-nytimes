 Q. We see the pizza-size dishes used to pick up satellite TV signals, so how does that stubby, pencil-size antenna on my portable G.P.S. receiver get information from a satellite in orbit more than 12,000 miles up? A. The global positioning system receiver is pulling in a much simpler set of data, said   Alan J. Friedman, consulting senior scientist for the New York Hall of Science. Television satellite receivers pull in hundreds of channels of pictures, each refreshed 30 times a second, as well as sound, he said. “Since it is all digital, that’s a lot of numbers which must be transmitted and received every second, and the receiver’s dish antenna has to pick out those numbers from the electronic noise all around us.” The G.P.S. receiver needs only two small sets of numbers from each of four or more satellites: the time on a super-precise clock in each satellite and the position of that satellite. The time on each satellite’s clock will appear to have tiny variations from satellite to satellite because of their motion as they orbit the Earth, Dr. Friedman explained. “Those tiny differences, and the positions of the satellites, are fed to a computer chip inside the G.P.S. receiver (programmed using relativity theory) to calculate where the receiver must be on the Earth,” Dr. Friedman said. “Anyplace else on the Earth, the numbers would have been different at that moment in time.” Readers are invited to submit questions by mail to Question, Science Times, The New York Times, 620 8th Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10018, or by e-mail to question@nytimes.com.
