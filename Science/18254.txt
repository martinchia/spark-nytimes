 To the Editor: Re “You Remind Me of Me” (Feb. 12): On the first day of school, in my English classroom, I write, “You have only one chance to make a first impression.” The students assume the message is for them, but I know that it is for me. A college study which interviewed students immediately after a professor’s course introduction discovered that their opinions about the professor differed very little from the ones expressed when they were interviewed at a later time. Benedict Carey’s story rings true for those of us who, in our work, bear the fruit (or curse) of making a first impression. Joan Evangelisti Racine, Wis. Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
