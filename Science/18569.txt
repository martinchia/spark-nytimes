Steel pilesare driven more than 300 feet through mud and rest on bedrock. Thirteen 8-foot diameter concrete piles extend nearly 200 feet below the water to keep the tower stable. Wire bundles are individually anchored into the deck. Cables suspend the road deck from the main cable. Main cable rides over a saddle at the top of the tower. Steel tie-down between the foundation and cap beam help control movement in an earthquake. The cable bends around a large concrete-and-steel beam at the western end of the road deck.
