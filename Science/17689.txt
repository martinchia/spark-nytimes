 So-called cleaner fish are among the best-known examples of mutualism in nature. These small fish eat parasites off the skin of larger fish, and it’s a win-win situation — the small fish gets food and protection from predators while the larger one stays clean and healthy. (The parasites, on the other hand, are big-time losers.) Researchers have now demonstrated that a similar mutualism occurs on land. Natalia B. Biani and Ulrich G. Mueller of the University of Texas, with William T. Wcislo of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, found clear evidence of what had long been hypothesized: that mites have a mutually beneficial relationship with sweat bees, cleaning the bees’ nests of fungi. These bees, of the genus Megalopta, make tunnels in dead wood and construct cells in which their brood develops. In the field in Panama, the researchers noticed that bee nests with mites had fewer fungi around brood cells, and that bee mortality was greater in nests without mites. Laboratory experiments provided further evidence that mites kept the fungal colonies under control. The findings are being published in the June issue of The American Naturalist. The mites’ service makes for a healthier nest. In return, the mites have a place to reproduce and an effective means of dispersing — they can ride on the bees to new territory. While there are a few other examples of cleaning behavior among terrestrial creatures — small birds that eat parasites off large mammals, for example — the researchers say the mite-bee interaction is among the most clear-cut cases of this kind of mutualism on land.
