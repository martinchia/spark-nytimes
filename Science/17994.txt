 Hospitals vary considerably in the frequency with which they induce labor and perform Caesarean sections. But a new study finds that these differences do not seem to affect how newborns fare in these facilities. Dr. J. Christopher Glantz, a professor of obstetrics at the University of Rochester, reviewed records of almost 30,000 births from 10 upstate New York community hospitals without specialized neonatal intensive care units. Some hospitals relied heavily on induced labor and Caesarean sections, while others performed the procedures much less often. Dr. Glantz measured neonatal outcomes in three ways: whether a child was moved to an intensive care hospital, whether a child needed immediate assisted ventilation and whether a child received a low Apgar score. He found no difference in outcomes for babies born in the hospitals with the highest rates of these procedures and those with the lowest. The result suggests that routine reliance on the procedures does little to improve outcomes for infants, he said. “I’m not saying that no interventions should be the goal,” Dr. Glantz said. “But when you see the difference in rates of these interventions with no difference in outcome, it leads me to believe that we can get by with fewer of them.” Dr. Glantz acknowledged that the study, in the April issue of The Journal of Maternal-Fetal and Neonatal Medicine, was retrospective and could not control for all confounding factors. A version of this article appears in print on April 26, 2011, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: CHILDBIRTH: More Labor Interventions, Same Outcomes.
