 Q. Why are the leaves still clinging to my Japanese maple this winter, shriveled and brown, rather than falling to form a vermilion carpet as usual? A. There are three possible explanations, two of them connected to alteration of autumn’s normal sequence of light and temperature changes, said Dennis Wm. Stevenson, the vice president for botanical research at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. “Color change and leaf fall in temperate-climate plants are determined primarily by the increasing length of the night,” Dr. Stevenson said. “Usually, this is accompanied by cool nights and low humidity.” Because there was an unusually warm fall in the northeastern United States, he said, the annual leaf cycle may have been “disrupted to the point where the normal response was overridden and thus winter caught the otherwise green leaves,” leaving them on the branches.

This effect can sometimes be seen on just the side of a tree nearest to a light source, he said. Finally, Dr. Stevenson said, it is possible “that the tree actually died, which will be tested this spring if the plant fails to produce new foliage.” Advertisement question@nytimes.com A version of this article appears in print on January 6, 2015, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: When Leaves Fail to Fall.
