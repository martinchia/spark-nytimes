 POSSIBLE LOCATIONS Plugs could be placed near stations and other points at which water might enter the tunnel. INFLATED PLUG RIVER or other body of water SUBWAY TUNNEL INFLATION FULLY INFLATED PLUG STOWED  PLUG SUBWAY TUNNEL 2 The deployed plug would unfold onto the tunnel floor and start to inflate as its air pump is activated. 3 When fully inflated and pressurized, the plug can hold back floodwaters entering the tunnel. 1 In the stowed position, the inflatable plug doesnâ€™t restrict train traffic. The plug can be deployed remotely. 10-20 p.s.i. THREE LAYERS FOR REDUNDANCY THIRD RAIL TRACK RAISED FLOOR SUBWAY TUNNEL TUNNEL MODIFICATIONS FRICTION woven vectran armor vectran LINER PLUG TUNNEL FLOOD- WATER POLYurethane BLADDER INFLATED PLUG, 32 fEEt LONG and 16.2 fEEt in diameter Innermost is an airtight polyurethane bladder, protected by a Vectran liner. The outermost layer of Vectran belts holds the balloon together under high pressure. AIR TUBE  from an electric air pump for inflation THE UTILITY LINES  would have flexible hangers to allow them to be pushed close to the wall by the plug. THE THIRD RAIL  would have a section removed where the tunnel floor is raised. THE TUNNEL FLOOR would be raised to match the top of the track to provide a better seal for the plug. A plug can be pressurized in about 30 minutes. The plug would be held in place by friction because it is squeezed tightly against the tunnel walls when fully inflated and pressurized.
