 A type of bacteria that infects many insects may make mosquitoes more resistant to viruses that can be dangerous to humans, researchers have found. The discovery could be helpful in the battles against two painful and sometimes fatal diseases, dengue and chikungunya. Last year, researchers showed they could take Wolbachia bacteria from fruit flies and infect mosquitoes with it, cutting their already brief life spans by half. That discovery was important because most of the malaria transmitted by female mosquitoes is transmitted late in their lives. They must pick up the parasites by biting an infected human, and it takes days for them to mature and migrate to the salivary glands to infect the next human bitten. Now, according a new report in the journal Cell, researchers from Australia and Brazil have shown that the Wolbachia infection makes the Aedes aegypti mosquito more resistant to dengue, which is also known as “breakbone fever,” and to chikungunya, known as “bending-up disease.” The bacteria appear to strengthen the mosquito’s immune system, the authors said, and may also use up some fatty acids that the viruses need to reproduce. Infecting mosquitoes with bacteria is tedious; thousands of embryos must be injected with superfine needles. But the bacteria then pass on to succeeding generations, and can even prevent uninfected embryos from surviving. Therefore, it may be possible to infect a small flock of mosquitoes and release them to spread the bacteria to every mosquito in a region. A version of this article appears in print on January 5, 2010, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: Microbes: Fighting Mosquito-Transmitted Viruses With Bacteria That Infect Many Insects.
