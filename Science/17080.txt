 This week’s GIF science lesson shows what’s possible with just two mirrors. The architects Shohei Shigematsu and Scott Abrahams conceived of this periscope when renovating the New York studio of their client, Cai Guo-Qiang, an artist known for his fireworks displays. The goal was to offset Mr. Guo-Qiang’s concerns about the would-be darkness and isolation that would result from expanding his studio into the basement. The contraption, more commonly found in submarines and spy novels, makes it possible for the woman in the basement to see the street above. In most periscopes, the mirrors are placed at 45-degree angles, with the viewer looking forward. But in this version, the two mirrors are placed a bit differently so that the image can be seen by looking down at a desk in the basement. “You’re looking at what should be a cloud, but you’re seeing people walking along a sidewalk,” said  Mats Selen, a physics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who agreed to explain how it works. Essentially a light source bounces like a pinball from one angled mirror to another, and finally lands right before your eyes, the same way it does in an S.L.R. camera. After hitting the first mirror, the light source shoots off to a second one that flips it before the light finally strikes the photoreceptors in the eye’s retina for processing. Rods take in light, and cones take in color. Together they provide your brain with a picture normally blocked by structural boundaries, like the building’s original stone walls. A version of this article appears in print on August 30, 2016, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Mirror Images: A Basement With a View.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
