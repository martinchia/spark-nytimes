 Q. My son, who had pin-straight hair at birth, developed very curly hair at puberty. Is this because the hair follicles change shape, perhaps influenced by hormone shifts? A. The straightness or curliness of hair has long been linked to the shape of hair follicles, and some researchers think  that changing hormones may affect them at stages like puberty, pregnancy and menopause. When chemotherapy to kill cancer cells affects other fast-growing cells, like those of the hair follicle, the hair shows changes in texture and curl when it grows back. Genetic and metabolic diseases also affect hair texture. A 2007 study of straight and curly hair by the research arm of the cosmetics conglomerate L’Oreal, published in The International Journal of Dermatology, found structural differences in the distribution of a protein called keratin in the hair shaft, ascribing them in part to the influence of the shape of the hair follicle on the bulb before the strand emerged. In curly hair, the study said, more keratin accumulated on the concave side of the curve, while in straight hair, the keratin cells were evenly distributed. The hair substance thus seemed to retain a memory of the hook-shaped or straight bulb. L’Oreal researchers also cultured hair bulbs to observe hair growth in the test tube, and they have theorized that hormone therapy might someday be employed to change hair texture.
