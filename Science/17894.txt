Large variations in blood pressure readings from one doctorâs appointment to another are associated with cardiovascular disease and death, a new study has found. Researchers used data from more than 25,000 people participating in a study of medicines for hypertension. They took seven blood pressure readings during months six to 28 of the study and then followed the patients for an average of 2.8 more years. The study is in Annals of Internal Medicine. Compared with those in the lowest one-fifth for variability in systolic blood pressure readings, those in the highest one-fifth were 30 percent more likely to die of cardiovascular disease or have a nonfatal heart attack, 46 percent more likely to have a stroke, 25 percent more likely to have heart failure, and 58 percent more likely to die from any cause. The researchers controlled for age, sex, race, smoking, diabetes and other factors. While the study found an association, it does not prove cause and effect. âWe usually use average blood pressure as a measure, because reducing that has led to reduced risk. The fluctuations get dismissed,â said the lead author, Paul Muntner, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. âBut variability in blood pressure appears to be a strong risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and it may be an important thing for doctors to look at.â Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
