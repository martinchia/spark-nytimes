Several weeks ago on the hospital floor where Iâm a nurse, we had a V.I.P. patient whose spouse expected, and got, the red-carpet treatment. The patientâs spouse made many demands, but what struck most of us as particularly galling was the meal service both received. Day after day, meal after meal, a hospital employee wheeled a china-laden cart into that patientâs room. It looked like room service at a fancy hotel. Each time one of these splendid repasts came to the floor, work would stop while we watched the cart roll past the large metal service container stacked with trays that held the other patientsâ meals. âI find that really distasteful,â I found myself muttering as the cart went by. Another staff member who overheard me said, âYouâre not the only one who feels that way.â The rage felt by the nurses on the floor was palpable. âRemember Mr. So-and-So who had no money at all â his wife couldnât get a free meal,â one remarked. Designating certain patients as V.I.P.âs is  common enough  in many hospitals, and typically people donât pay extra for it. But no one liked the idea that one patient, as a result of connections and wealth, would be treated so much better than the others. And yet, as nurses we also know that the health insurance system we have lived with for years apportions medical care in just  the same way. Some patients can afford the best insurance, while others cannot afford any at all, or are denied insurance because of pre-existing medical conditions, or lose insurance coverage when their cap on benefits is reached. And while the new health care legislation will not erase all inequalities, many more people will now be able to afford insurance, or find better and less expensive insurance from insurance exchanges, and ultimately get better care. Patients like the woman who faced a $600 co-pay each time she came to our hospital and, because she had leukemia, she had to come often. It was money she didnât have. âWe have lousy insurance,â she told me. Another patient had to have CT scans done off site, where it was less expensive, because he was paying for the scans himself. In the months of debate leading to the vote on health care, we heard these stories over and over, along with the even more tragic stories of seriously ill patients dropped by their insurance companies, or the people who died for lack of insurance to pay for treatments. These vast disparities in health care coverage trouble me because they compromise, in a subtle but real way, my ability to do my best work as a nurse. The most important job of any nurse is to be a patient advocate. If physicians are known by the phrase, âFirst, do no harm,â nursing might be characterized as âAbove all, do good.â If the best care possible, or at times any care beyond the emergency room, is out of reach for some patients because they have inadequate insurance, or none, then the nurseâs role as patient advocate becomes a sham. The American Nurses Association strongly supported the health care overhaul  effort because, as the organizationâs president, Rebecca M. Patton, explained, âI have all the conviction in my heart and in my brain that what was passed will improve health care for all.â Crucial provisions of the bill provide money for the education of advanced practice nurses, guaranteeing that more patients in need of primary care will benefit from nurse-oriented holistic care. Of course, the bill is not perfect, and many of the nurses I work with do not think itâs a good thing. They worry that involving government in our private health insurance system will create even worse problems than we have now. Weâll have to see how it plays out. But for me, working on the front lines of health care, passage of this bill feels like a relief. Relief that a patient will not have to worry about affording the treatment needed to stop her cancer. Relief that medication decisions will be based on effectiveness and not cost. Relief that I can educate patients about the drugs they need without fretting that they wonât take them if they canât afford them. Because hereâs the bottom line: All patients are very important people, and they deserve the best modern health care. In the current system, some patients eat elegantly prepared food off china dishes, while others get nothing at all. Iâm a nurse; I want to know that all my patients get a decent meal. Comments are no longer being accepted. I know this is beside the point of your article, but you and your colleagues can rest assured that while the VIP patient is enjoying eating off of china plates, he/she is actually getting worse medical care than the regular joes in the hospital.  As a physician who has to (unfortunately) work with so-called “VIP” patients every now and then, I’ve seen first hand how their status or influence in the hospital ensures that the medical decisions made are not just based on what science says, but what would best please them.  Oftentimes what is most comfortable for the patient isn’t necessarily what’s best for them in the long run.  Like Michael Jackson, Anna Nicole Smith, Heath Ledger, and many others, VIP status in a hospital often ends up enabling the patient to a tragic end. I don’t get the point of this.  Were the VIP’s getting this treatment for free or were they paying extra?  All of our health insurances reflect what we pay for it either through our employer or our own.  Everything in life reflects what we can afford. Is Nurse Brown saying everyone should be treated equal?  I will bet if she goes into her own hospital she won’t want to be treated like an off the street patient. What does she think about Obama getting a PSA and a colonoscopy for his physical even though he isn’t 50 and should not have gotten either. theresa, *this* is what the money is for. making life easier while you’re going through a bad time. would you rather these people spent their money on fancy cars and prada sunglasses?  yes, there’s a disparity on the floor. shouldn’t everyone get nice meals? you seem to be leveling anger at the person/family who could afford the special treatment, and while i feel we ALL deserve the treatment the fact is that there will always be people with more money than others i would hope that those who have more use it in sensible ways. like making a stay on the oncology ward just a little less horrible. Having been on the receiving end of not-so-good- treatment from “some” people working in the healthcare system, I agree there needs to be a focus in providing better bed side manner.   I also feel that when Nurses dish out “the bad” it’s because “the bad” comes from higher up.  I have seen “ill-prepared” people placed in management positions thus creating the ill-will in the nurses.  I have seen that when women become bosses, they tend to take the new authority to an extreme often forgetting she was once a nurse herself!!   I dare anyone to tell me this never happens… If you donated a building to the hospital, wouldn’t you expect to be treated like royalty as a patient there too?   Oh wait I forgot.  Money is evil. Excellent article.  I too, am a nurse, however I work for a large non-profit health plan that supports health care reform.  When I worked at the bedside, I worked in a large urban county funded Emergency Department where we saw the worst of the worst.  The saddest cases were those folks who were directed to the care provided at our facility based on the fact their insurance had dropped them due to a chronic or devastating illness.  The health care reform bill, while not perfect, will at least offer the opportunity for those who need and want care to get that care.  Health care should not be another luxury item for the “haves” while the “have nots” go without or receive disjointed care.  Yes our health care is expensive, but it is the best the medical science has to offer, and the ability to pay or not pay should not be the platform of how care is provided.  And everyone needs to ask themselves, what if it was their family member who couldn’t get the care while the VIP upstairs in the large comfy room, getting meals on china service was demanding preferential treatment.  And many don’t realize that the health care reform bill has the potential to decrease costs overall.  Case in point:  Many patients showing up in Emergency Rooms are diagnosed and admitted to expensive hospital care because they were not able to afford to see a physician sooner.  If patients have the ability to get preventative care, as well as get the care they need to prevent a life threatening episode-this has great potential to reduce costs overall, free up needed resources which include nursing staff, hospital beds, and ambulance response.  This is not the panacea, but it is a start that has been long overdue. I knew an about 65 year old billionare with many chronic health problems. He came into his fortune by sheer luck — not via work.  When he had a heart attack he was given virtually a whole floor in a major New York City teaching hospital: no surprise. It’s all due to our values and economic system. Some people’s bonus exceeds that of the salary of all
the ‘workers.’ Some folks have four homes… Some folks live on the street. This quite rich man died anyway. Joan Baez has sung a folk ballad with the lyrics which uncluded (approximately): ‘If we could prolong life, the rich would live and the poor would continue to die.’ This essay seems like a Rant fron Ayn Rand. Ms Brown’s problems with the “inequality” of the healthcare system arent even addressed by the current HC bill, nor do any other countries offer the kind of “equality” that she wants. Even in the UK, Canada, Germany, and France, rich people have options that poor people will never have, even in a socialized medical system.  Rich folks in Canada have the opportunity to go to private clinics where they can see specialists sooner than somebody in the public/socialized model can.  The only way to change that is to outright make all private healthcare illegal.  Canada tried that for awhile, but the Canadian Supreme Court stuck it down as unconstitutional. The only way to have a truly “equal” healthcare system where poor people have exactly the same access as rich people is to have an outright ban on all private healthcare entities, including doctors, hospitals, outpatient clinics, etc.  Nobody, not even France or Germany, operates under that model. On the other hand, I can tell you after a recent hospital stay myself and several that family members had, patients in the hospital without family suffer.  Had a family member been with me, I would not have listened to the loud beeping of my IV pump in the middle of the night for more than ten minutes after I alerted the staff–and this happened multiple times in one night when there were no emergencies on our floor.  I suspect I would not have repeatedly been served food to which I’m allergic.  I was fortunate for the time that I did have someone with me–to *buy* me a healthy, whole-grain sandwich with lean turkey and vegetables to replace the starch-laden, red-meat lunch I was served.  Yes, a level playing field would be better–but for everyone. Ms. Brown should concentrate more on not making a medication error than who’s eating what. I too work at a hospital that regularly has “VIP’s.” This designation is usually assigned by Administration and has nothing to do with the nursing care the patient and their family receive. The shame of the health care bill is that there will now be greater disparity. People with money will not put up with lines and rationing, as Danny Williams, the Canadian premier of Newfoundland and Labrador recently proved when he headed south to an undisclosed American hospital for cardiac surgery. The middle class and poor will actually receive worse care.  And as most third world nations demonstrate, meals are not served, and you’d better bring your own sheets, if you get a bed. [Comment #7 > continued] And don’t forget our DNA which changed only a little via evolution for millennia. He he, you guys are funny – level palying field … This is what Soviet Union tried to create, and look how that turned out. You don’t create level playing fields by lowering everybody’s standard of living. Theresa, when you mean level playing field are you saying you want communism? If I had to choose between taking care of a VIP or an average patient I would take the average patient any day. I feel that most VIP don’t receive very good care because they are so obnoxious and demanding that no one wants to go in to their room. They always remind you that they gave alot of money to the hospital. It is alot easier to take care of a patient who is nice and appreciative of what you do for them. Thank you Theresa for your comments!
For those of us who are actually providing primary care, the ability to  treat the patient based on best practices rather than according to the patient’s insurance status will be a relief! This health care bill attempts to level the playing field. This is the reason many health care providers are for health reform and a significant were for single payer and/or public option. (Save money by removing the intermediary-the insurance company).  There is no reason why people can’t buy extras as they see fit but at least everyone will have a certain level of basic primary care.
Now we just need primary care providers-Nurse Practitioners, Physician Assistants and MD’s/DO’s at the same table developing a strategic plan to handle the influx of patients needing primary care providers! I find it hard to sympathize with the person receiving unfair (and unpaid-for) VIP treatment, and I find the china-laden cart episode beyond ridiculous.
However, let me take it where none is taking it: hospital food is unbelievably bad in this country.
There is absolutely no excuse for this. Especially, given how outrageously expensive hospital care is!
Only thing I can think of is, this is another perversity of the system, aimed to remind you, should you ever forget, that no matter how vulnerable you are and how badly you need to be cared for, money, and money only, will make a difference! Frankly, that the nurses all stopped working to watch the meal cart go down the hall sounds like petty jealousy to me.  I hope Nurse Brown didn’t give that patient a lower level of care because Brown resented the patient’s wealth. Thanks, Teresa.  I have been a nurse for 25 years, and unfortunately, have seen similar behaviors.  It seems as some of the other folks have either not been on the receiving end of health care or confuse receiving quality care with socialism(a far reach).  No one deserves less care than anyone else regardless of status or ability to pay.  I’m sure any of the people who have commented would expect and demand no less than anyone else. Agree with those that suggest the VIPs get less effective care than “regular” patients. Both doctors and nurses tiptoe around VIPs so as not to upset them; routines and checklists that are routinely engaged are often omitted in caring for them. #1’s point about Michael Jackson et al is well taken. Money can buy luxury such as house calls and personal physicians–but it can’t buy health or happiness. //glasshospital.com/2010/03/28/house-calls/ -Dr. John Seventeen years of primary care nursing and I never treated a patient according to the “patient’s insurance status.” There are laws already on the books against that such as EMTALA.  If Nurse Cynthia is now relieved, she’ll have to get un-relieved for about four years until these mandates take effect. The straw-man argument of removing the intermediary, the insurance company, is just that. Now you will have the entire Federal government in between you and the patient, along with the IRS. Everyone already has basic primary care. It’s called the Emergency Room. Or a clinic for Medicaid patients. This law attempts to level the playing field by making everything mediocre. Imagine having only General Surgeons available for every surgery. That’s mediocrity. That’s this law. This article is a joke.  Why is this nurse crying about someone spending money at the hospital who can actually pay their bills?  That VIP probably paid for 6 other patients’ hospital stay himself. I am appalled by some of the comments made by people who don’t work in hospitals, who criticize the author of this article. Many Americans are plain ignorant about health care in other countries, yet label it as “socialist” and cite foreigners coming to the US for treatment. Do you know about “medical tourism”, how many LEAVE this system for better, less expensive care elsewhere?
As a nurse, I hope you get good treatment when you or your loved ones have to be hospitalized. Most nurses want this, that everyone gets what we consider good treatment, but for the reader who wrote sarcastically that “money is evil”, I retort that there should be no place for profit in your illness, or your wife’s or your child. Doesn’t it make you uncomfortable, at the very least, to know that someone is benefiting from your loved one’s pain? Most of my co-workers, often legal immigrants as I am, hope for universal health care in this country. And please don’t make the assumption that I came here to nurse because the US system is “better”. It just ain’t so!!! The difficulty clinicians have following the moral imperative to take care of all patients ( including the rich arrogant ones , the average compliant ones, and the abusive or noncompliant) will not be eliminated by a health care mandate or any carte blanche insurance. This article makes a poor case for the health care law and makes little sense. I don’t begrudge anyone getting a little special treatment but to the degree this couple abused the privledge, others were pressed to give adequate care to others.  Hospitals are what they are, not hotels and adults should not need to be “rewarded” for compliance to the care plan.
Of topic but no one really care how much others make in terms of salary etc., as long as they pay their fair share of taxes.  Totally. What I really don’t understand is how people complain about how the American Public won’t take “lines and rationing.” I have good health insurance and it still takes me 3 months to see my GP. I have to change doctors every time I change jobs because my doctor is never covered by the new insurance plan. There are certain procedures that aren’t covered by my insurance, and I can pay out of pocket if I want to. So I don’t really see the difference between our system and the single payer system EXCEPT for the 30 million people who can’t afford insurance in the US. Yes, the practice of treating certain patients as VIP’s is galling. Officially, I believe that most hospitals maintain that they do not have VIPs, but they are being dishonest. It happens all the time.
For those who have no problem with it, I say do you believe a nurse has unlimited time? No, time is his or her scarcest resource. Time spent catering to the whims of one individual takes away from time spent with another (who may very well have a problem with higher priority). As much as I would like it it to be so, our time is not elastic. Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
