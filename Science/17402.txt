 From: "Mason, Sally K."To:Date: Sun, 9 Jul 2006 14:58:31 -0400Subject: RE: Concern Lefteri, I appreciate your concern, and the kind words. We're entering the stage of formal investigation into this work as outlined under executive memorandum C-22. It's extremely important that we follow our procedures to a T. This will make the reporters very unhappy, because we guarantee confidentiality while the investigation is ongoing. However, we will get to the bottom of what has happened. My hope is that we will also demonstrate the integrity of our institution. For integrity to be maintained we need to allow the process to work. I know the committee will be contacting you at some point for input. You can be most helpful by sharing with them, and only with them, what you understand to be the facts of this case. I will continue to withhold any judgment until the committee is prepared to issue a report. Again, thank you for the offer to discuss this. There may come a time when it would be appropriate for me to have such a discussion, and I will hold your offer in reserve. Sally [Note: Personal contact information has been deleted.
