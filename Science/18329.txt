 They swallowed what? Soda can manufacturers replaced pull tabs with “stay-tabs” because children had a habit of pulling off the tab, throwing it into the drink to avoid throwing it on the sidewalk and then swallowing it when they took a big swig. But it turns out that even stay-tabs are not childproof. In March, a 7-year-old was taken to a Cincinnati emergency room with a stomachache after swallowing a stay-tab. Aluminum is hard to see on an X-ray, but a scan spotted it. That led Dr. Lane F. Donnelly, radiologist in chief at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, to look for other reports of stay-tab swallowing. Dr. Donnelly found 19 such reports from  the hospital since 1993. Only four of the tabs could be seen on an X-ray, said Dr. Donnelly, who presented his findings on Nov. 20 at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America. And though younger children are generally more likely to swallow things accidentally, most of the swallowers were in their teens, he said. Robert Budway, president of the Can Manufacturers Institute, an industry group, said he was mystified by the report. “We’ve never heard this before,” Mr. Budway said. “These tabs stay on unless you tear them off, and they don’t come off readily. They’re manufactured and designed to stay on.” Because of an editing error, a report in the Vital Signs column on Tuesday about accidental swallowing of soda-can tabs misstated the extent of a radiologist’s study of the problem. The researcher, Dr. Lane F. Donnelly, found reports of 19 such incidents from 1993 to 2009 at his own hospital, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center  not at “hospitals.” A version of this article appears in print on December 8, 2009, on Page D6 of the National edition with the headline: Hazards: ‘Stay-Tabs’ on Cans Sometimes Swallowed.
