 To the Editor: Re “The Downside of Doctors Who Feel Your Pain” (Essay, Nov. 1): Dr. Lisa Rosenbaum justly cautions that empathy does not compensate for inadequate medical knowledge or skill. What medical schools should do is to teach students how to talk well with patients. There is an established body of linguistic knowledge about such things as eliciting patients’ concerns, framing discussions about whether to have surgery, delivering bad news, perceiving a patient’s indirect expression about reluctance to take medication and many other medical subjects. These things can be learned, and the connectedness that they prompt can also foster empathy. David E. Ness, M.D. Houston Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
