The most effective treatment for the pain of knee osteoarthritis may be an injection of hyaluronic acid or corticosteroids, and the least effective may be Tylenol or Celebrex pills, a review of studies concludes. The analysis, in Annals of Internal Medicine, reviewed 137 randomized trials involving more than 33,000 patients. Treatments included acetaminophen (Tylenol), diclofenac, ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib (Celebrex), corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid injections, and oral and injected placebos. With the exception of Tylenol and Celebrex, the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, over all, provided clinically significant relief after three months when compared with a placebo. But the injections, and at least sometimes even the placebo injections, were more effective than any of the pills. The lead author, Dr. Raveendhara R. Bannuru, a researcher at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, said that although some treatments appear generally better than others, there is no single treatment that is best for everyone. âThe key message is that hyaluronic acid and steroid injections are more effective than drugs,â he said. âBut all the harms and benefits need to be taken into account,â he added. âI would advise people to talk to their physicians about the pros and cons, and choose the treatment appropriate for them.â A version of this article appears in print on 01/06/2015, on page D4 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Nostrums: Weighing Knee Pain Remedies.
