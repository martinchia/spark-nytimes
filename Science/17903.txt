 To the Editor: I very much appreciate the sentiments expressed by Dana Jennings in “Losing a Comforting Ritual: Treatment” (Cases, June 30). The post-treatment syndrome is a common occurrence among cancer patients who may experience a profound sense of loss and confusion once the immediate crises  are over. Often, the transition from cancer patient to cancer survivor is as traumatic as the earlier crises. Psychotherapy, individual and/or group, can ease this trauma, helping the patient work through the daunting emotions that accompany the cancer survivor long after the treatment ends. Ruth H.
