 Giving intravenous fluids before taking an accident victim to the hospital is routine in many emergency services systems, but a new study suggests that the practice may do more harm than good. Researchers analyzed a national database covering the years 2001 to 2005, which included complete records for 311,071 patients with penetrating or blunt injuries. Their study is being published in The Annals of Surgery. In almost every way they analyzed the data — by blunt or penetrating injury, by gunshot wound, by low blood pressure of the victim, by immediate surgery — giving IV fluids was associated with higher rates of death. For some types of injuries the differences were stark. Those with severe head injuries were 34 percent more likely to die if they came to the hospital on IV fluids; those with a gunshot wound and low blood pressure were more than 70 percent more likely to die. The researchers suggest that inserting an IV can mean critical delays in getting to the hospital, and that giving fluids can increase bleeding or release a blood clot that has already formed. “It’s hard to say it, but the new intervention is to do less,” Dr. Elliott R. Haut, an associate professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins and the lead author of the study. “The best thing to do is rapidly bring the patient to a trauma center.” A version of this article appears in print on January 18, 2011, on Page D6 of the New York edition with the headline: REGIMENS: Doubt on IV Fluids for Trauma Victims.
