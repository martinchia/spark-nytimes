 THE FACTS Can too much soda cause brittle bones? In studies, soda drinkers of all ages have been shown to have higher rates of broken bones and fractures than their non-soda-drinking peers. And for years, scientists have suspected that soda's caffeine, phosphorus and carbonation may interfere with calcium absorption. But other studies that have taken a hard look at the claim suggest there may be nothing to it. Caffeine is the one ingredient in soda that has been shown to have any direct effect on calcium, but scientists say the effect is so minimal that it can be offset by a normal diet. One randomized study that showed this directly was published in 2001 by a team at the Creighton University Osteoporosis Research Center. The researchers followed 32 people for a month and had them drink different formulations of soda with varying levels of caffeine, phosphorus or citric acid so they could take urine samples and determine how much calcium the subjects were excreting. As expected, those who drank caffeine-rich sodas excreted calcium; the others did not. But the levels excreted were not considered significant. Dr. Robert P. Heaney, the lead author of the study, said it was likely that soda drinkers had weaker bones because the soda in their diet was displacing other drinks that had calcium, like orange juice and milk. The problem is not what soda contains, he said, but what it does not. THE BOTTOM LINE Soda has little effect on calcium levels, but people who drink it may be at greater risk of bone injuries because it takes the place of more nutritious drinks.
