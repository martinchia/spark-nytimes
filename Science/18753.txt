 A group of humpback dolphins off the northern coast of Australia has been designated a separate species, previously unknown, following a genetic investigation by scientists with the Wildlife Conservation Society. Looking to prove that there were more than two species of humpback dolphin, researchers collected physical and genetic evidence from the animals around the world, eventually proving there were four distinct species. The Australian group has not yet been given a name.
