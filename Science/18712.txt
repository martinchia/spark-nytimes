Steve Zack, a Wildlife Conservation Society scientist based in Portland, Ore., narrated a photographic look at his expedition to Arctic Alaska: The Utukok River, emerging on the north side of the Brooks Range, as seen from our plane, braids through Arctic uplands. Here, well north of the tree line, the landscape is open and immense — we are in the most remote region of North America.  We are in the Utukok River Uplands Special Area of the National Petroleum Reserve.  It is here that caribou in Alaska's largest herd, now some 380,000 in number, migrate to calve their young.  And it is here that perhaps one of the most dramatic predator-prey spectacles anywhere plays out, with grizzlies, wolves and wolverine preying on the caribou — and yet few Americans are aware of it.
