 THE FACTS  Scientists recently confirmed the age-old notion that hot liquids can relieve some cold and flu symptoms. But what about a dose of heat on a much larger scale — say, in a sauna? With temperatures of 176 Fahrenheit or greater, saunas have been recommended for arthritis,  asthma and chronic fatigue, among other things,  since they were  used by nomads in Finland centuries ago. Some  reputed benefits have not been examined, but there is  evidence  that  saunas may speed recovery from colds and  reduce their occurrence. Some researchers suspect   sauna heat reduces symptoms because it  improves drainage, while others speculate that the high temperatures help weaken cold and flu viruses. Why this might prevent sickness  in the first place, however, is  unclear. But research suggests  an effect. In one study by Austrian researchers, for example, a group of 50 adults were split into two groups and tracked for six months. One group was instructed to use saunas regularly;  the other group abstained. At the end of the study the sauna group had contracted fewer colds.

Other studies have found similar results. But doctors caution that saunas can be hazardous to  those with heart or circulatory problems.
