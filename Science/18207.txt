 Federal officials who approve drugs review an enormous amount of data about their effectiveness and harmful side effects, but critical information often fails to reach the doctors who prescribe them, two Dartmouth Medical School researchers write in the Oct. 29 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. In the case of the sleeping pill Rozerem (ramelteon), for example, one review document from the Food and Drug Administration states that the drug made “no significant difference in time to fall asleep” and that patients “do not seem to recognize any benefit from treatment.” But the reviewer’s uncertainty about the drug’s effectiveness is not reflected in Rozerem’s label, which does not include efficacy data from a clinical trial of 848 young and middle-age adults; that trial found that the drug was no more effective than a placebo, and users actually took a minute longer to fall asleep than those on the dummy pill. Dr. Lisa M. Schwartz and Dr. Steven Woloshin, who wrote the essay, said that the F.D.A. revised the design of drug labels in 2006 to highlight appropriate uses and warnings but that more needed to be done. An agency spokeswoman said that it was “actively engaged in talking to stakeholders about the issue” but that there was no specific deadline for action. Officials with Takeda Pharmaceuticals, which markets Rozerem, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A version of this article appears in print on November 3, 2009, on Page D6 of the National edition with the headline: Awareness: Vital Facts May Be Missing on Drug Labels.
