 To the Editor: There are inconsistencies in blood donor eligibility policies, as noted in “Never Able to Forget a Chronic Disease” (Cases, May 10). However, one antiquated and discriminatory policy was not mentioned. Since the early 1980s, the F.D.A. has prohibited any man who has had sex with another man, even once, since 1977, from donating blood — regardless of H.I.V. status, rate of practicing safer sex or participation in a monogamous relationship. Yet, heterosexual men and women who have engaged in high-risk sexual behavior can donate after only 12 months. This reinforces inaccurate stereotypes about gay men and H.I.V., and results in a significant loss of healthy blood donors. Advancements in technology, which can detect H.I.V. in blood within days or weeks of infection, render this policy obsolete. The unnecessary exclusion of large numbers of H.I.V.-negative blood donors may harm people in need of blood transfusions. A thorough review of alternative policies is both timely and necessary.
