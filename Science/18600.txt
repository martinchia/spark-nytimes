 Q. Moments after a wasp was squashed on my patio, another wasp sniffed at the body, scooped it up and flew off with it. Are wasps cannibals, or did he carry it off to give it a decent burial? A. Some wasps are both carnivores and cannibals, and not too choosy about the meat they eat. Some species are known informally as cannibal wasps or meat wasps and are dreaded pests at picnics. In one study of how to combat an invasive wasp, Vespula pensylvanica, tuna cat food was successfully used as bait in traps. The ichneumon wasps are known for laying their eggs in the larvae of other insects, or even in a paralyzed adult, so that their offspring can hatch and feed on the living host. The perceived cruelty of such a natural plan helped influence Charles Darwin to doubt the existence of a beneficent creator, as he wrote in a letter to a friend in 1860. The apparent cannibalism of wasps toward adults of their own species was noted in a scientific journal as early as 1884, when a correspondent of the journal Nature reported observing some trapped wasps beginning to devour a weakened companion. Appalled, he put an end to it with a book cover. Some wasps have been observed eating their own adult siblings. A 2006 study, published in The Florida Entomologist, demonstrated that the parasitic species Melittobia digitata, known for its habit of lethal combat, was consuming defeated opponents of its own species as well as other insects. The researchers injected water-soluble dye in one of each pair of combatants and observed the dye in the feces of the victorious feeder.  question@nytimes.com A version of this article appears in print on September 10, 2013, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: All in the Family.
