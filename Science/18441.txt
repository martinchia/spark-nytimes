If you can’t spend your summer in Provence, you can at least capture the flavors of a summer meal. This week Martha Rose Shulman offers five new recipes with a Provençal flair. She writes: Last month I had a reunion in Provence with friends who discovered this magical region of France with me more than 30 years ago. It was a true southern French vacation â we relaxed, we went to the market, we cooked. Market stalls were piled high with summer squash, tomatoes and eggplant, green beans â both regular ones and the flat ones that we call romano beans and that my ProvenÃ§al market labeled cocos â onions of all kinds, braids of plump pink garlic, and leeks. Even the supermarket produce sections were inspiring. We bought short-grain rice from the Camargue, southwest of our area of Provence, for our risottos, and a local wheat berry called petit Ã©peautre for chewy pilafs and grain salads. We ate peaches, apricots, amazing strawberries and melons for dessert and for breakfast. When youâre summering in Provence, itâs easy to put vegetables seasoned with the thyme, rosemary and savory that grows everywhere at the center of your plate every day. But itâs also easy to do that here. All over the country, summer farmersâ markets are abundant with the same kinds of produce we enjoyed in Provence. My house may not be surrounded by lavender fields, but replicating the delicious dishes my friends and I made last month is a simple thing to do.  Here are five new recipes using the flavors of Provence. Farro Salad With Tomatoes and Romano Beans: A variety of wheat berry called petit Ã©peautre is one of the traditional grains in the inland ProvenÃ§al regions. For this recipe use farro, spelt or wheat berries.  Elizabethâs Braised Leeks With Parmesan: The sophisticated flavors and textures that this dish offers may convert those who think they donât like leeks. Sabineâs Stuffed Zucchini Flowers: This herbed zucchini mixture is also good for stuffing tomatoes. Risotto With Eggplant and Tomatoes: These quintessentially ProvenÃ§al vegetables work their magic in a silky and fragrant risotto. Salade NiÃ§oise With Yogurt Vinaigrette: You donât have to be in Provence to enjoy this salad, hearty with tuna, potatoes, tomatoes and plenty of other seasonal vegetables.
