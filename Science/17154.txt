 When medical researchers report their findings, they need to know whether their result is a real effect of what they are testing, or just a random occurrence. To figure this out, they most commonly use the p-value. This number (the p stands for probability) is arrived at through a complex calculation designed to quantify the probability that the results of an experiment were not due to chance. The possibility of a random result can never be completely eliminated, but for medical researchers the p-value is the accepted measure of whether the drug or procedure under study is having an effect. By convention, a p-value higher than 0.05 usually indicates that the results of the study, however good or bad, were probably due only to chance. There is considerable complexity in understanding the meaning of the p-value, and many subtleties in interpreting it. For various good reasons, the 0.05 convention has its detractors. But it is enough to say that a p-value provides a degree of assurance, not certainty. In medical research, certainty is very hard to come by. A version of this brief appears in print on March 12, 2013, on Page D7 of the New York edition with the headline: 0.05.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
