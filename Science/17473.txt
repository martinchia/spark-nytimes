 Men are at higher risk of being killed in car accidents if they are obese, researchers have found. Their findings spotlight not only another risk of being obese but a factor car designers may need to take into account as obesity increases in the United States. The study, which will appear in April in The American Journal of Public Health, found that obese women were not at higher risk of death in car crashes. The explanation may lie in the differing body shapes of men and women, said the lead author, Dr. Shankuan Zhu of the Injury Research Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin. Because of their weight, men experience greater forces in a crash. Other physical problems linked to obesity may also make men less able to withstand their injuries. And obese people can present treatment challenges in the hospital. But Dr. Zhu said he leaned to simple physics as the best explanation, specifically the momentum heavier people have in a crash. "Obese people have more mass," he said. The study drew on data gathered by the federal Department of Transportation involving more than 22,000 drivers who were in crashes from 1997 to 2001. The study also found some evidence that being heavier could help in an accident, perhaps because of the cushioning provided by fat. Men who had very low body mass indexes, below 22, were also at somewhat high risk of death. Those who were slightly overweight had the best survival rate.
