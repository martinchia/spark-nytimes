 Prescription for Parity To the Editor: Re “Illness More Prevalent Among Older Gay Adults” (Vital Signs, April 5): Health disparities among older gay people are the direct result of disparities in equality. There is no question about the cost of discrimination to the human body: increased stressors lead to increase in illness. The remedies are clear. To begin with, let’s put an end to institutionalized discrimination. Repeal laws like the Defense of Marriage Act. Lift the bans on same-sex marriage. Make it illegal to discriminate based on sexual identity, sexual orientation or gender expression in employment, housing, accommodation and credit. Our health care system can’t afford it.
