 To the Editor: “Looking Under the Hood and Seeing an Incubator” (Dec. 16) brought to mind an event in my own family history. In 1924 in the countryside near a small town in Texas, my mother gave birth to fraternal triplets, seven weeks prematurely. Although the family doctor was in attendance, there was no incubator at hand. My aunt, who lived on a farm nearby, came to help, and promptly initiated an old farm remedy for keeping the babies warm: each tiny baby was placed in a shoebox lined with fluffy cotton and then placed in a warm oven. One of the triplets died after four days, but the other two lived for over 70 years.   Joyce Bynum Salem, Ore. Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
