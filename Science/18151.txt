 To the Editor: Re  “A Musician Who Performs with a Scalpel”  (May 20): Dr. Claudius Conrad isn’t the only one who’s discovered the magic of Mozart. Twenty years ago, suffering agonizing pain from a herniated disc, I reduced my pain and fear of surgery with my favorite piece of music, Mozart’s Sinfonia Concertante K.364.
