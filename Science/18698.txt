 Q. Why do lobsters turn from dark blue-green to red when boiled? And why are they that dark color in the first place? A. A relatively simple explanation for the color change emerged in a study published in 2002: Heat changes the shape of a protein called beta-crustacyanin in the shell, relaxing its bonds with the pigment astaxanthin. The freed pigment reflects wavelengths of light in the red spectrum. But it turned out that the heat-related shape change accounted for only about a third of the color difference, according to a 2005 study by Dutch researchers in The Journal of the American Chemical Society. The new research pointed to a complex quantum-physics interaction that would account for a much larger shift — and for the living lobster’s original color.

Advertisement The previous research had found that the red pigment molecules were grouped in pairs within the crustacyanin, crossing each other in a tight X formation. The Dutch researchers calculated that they interfered with one another, causing shifts in their quantum energy states, thus altering the wavelengths of light that are absorbed. Using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy to examine protein-pigment interactions, the researchers found that this effect was a large one, suggesting that it is the primary source of lobster color.    question@nytimes.com A version of this article appears in print on September 17, 2013, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: Seeing Red.
