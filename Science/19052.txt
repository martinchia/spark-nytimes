Martha Rose Shulman on healthful cooking. A couple of months ago, at the height of the summer tomato season, I gave you a recipe for a delicious whole wheat focaccia with tomatoes and fontina. I was so enthralled with the bread that I decided Iâd come back to it and post a weekâs worth of focaccia recipes. I made a savory focaccia topped with the last of my cherry tomato crop, another one with eggplant and peppers, and one with some wild oyster mushrooms I found at my farmersâ market. I also experimented with a dough that contains mashed potatoes as well as the Community Grains whole wheat flour I love; the bread was fluffy and moist. Then I decided to play around with sweet focaccia. I added a small amount of sugar to the dough, topped the breads with fruit and nuts, drizzled on rosemary-scented olive oil and sprinkled them with chopped rosemary and a little more sugar. The combination of the savory, woody rosemary and the sweet fruit was wonderful, and I found myself eating the breads at breakfast, lunch and dinner. When they were a few days old, I topped them with a little blue cheese or feta and lightly toasted pieces in my toaster oven for a sinfully good treat. Toasting one- or two-day-old focaccia in a toaster oven or on a grill is the perfect way to make this irresistible bread last. Focaccia takes more time to make than pizza, but I find that itâs less challenging to make and itâs more versatile in some ways. You can serve it warm or at room temperature, as a snack or as a small meal. Itâs easy to transport, freezes well and lends itself beautifully to whole grain flour.
