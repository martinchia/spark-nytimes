Susan Gubar writes about life with ovarian cancer. The vigilant man who has taken care of me for five years of cancer treatment slipped on a step three days ago. It was like seeing an eagle shot down. He had to have the tendon in his left knee repaired. Hunched on a chair in our kitchen, he glares at me like a wild thing trapped.  âDonât fuss,â Don says, trying to lift himself up. The bulky cast with its Velcro fasteners starts above the knee and reaches to his calf. We eye the walker warily, realizing that my 120 pounds cannot lift his 180 pounds. Medications proliferate on the kitchen counter, as they did when I was at my weakest after a debulking operation and subsequent chemotherapy. Then I could not open the childproof vials; now he cannot. Then I could not walk on my own; now he cannot. Then I dozed through pain; now he does. âThis isnât a disease, but it takes as much attention as a disease,â he says. âOne, two, three,â I recite, pulling with one hand under his armpit and holding the walker steady with my other hand. âGive me a minute,â he says. I leave the room so he can garner the strength he will need to move into a standing position. Might the problem be the brace, I wonder. It seems to have slipped down and does not look as taut as it ought to be. While he rests, I decide to call the orthopedic practice. I respond to the automated instructions by pressing the number for a consultation with a nurse. âOur goal is a higher level of comprehensive care,â the recording intones while I am put on hold, and then the line goes dead.  A lightbulb and I dial again, this time pushing the button to make an appointment. Lo and behold: a human voice!  To someone named Jordan, I recount Donâs two falls during the night as well as my fears about the cast, and she instructs me to take him to the E.R. Thank goodness for doctorsâ receptionists, I think not for the first time. Though heâs disoriented and fatigued, I tackle the logistics â getting him dressed, into the car, stowing the walker, stopping for gas â that the trip entails. âHey there, young fella,â the physician assistant says after our long wait in the hall. I am about to fume at a 12-year-old patronizing my 87-year-old husband when she puts her ungloved hands on his swollen feet so gently that he does not wince. Her name is Sarah and she wants to examine the wound, but objects to the brace. âItâs too short, and look,â she says holding it up for us to see, âitâs bent . . .  maybe from the falls.â   When the dressing is removed, Sarah marvels at the line of staples on Donâs knee. âThese look great. And this is your first operation, ever?  You must be doing something right.â  When I ask about a wheelchair, she says, âWe want to build up his strength. Once he gets into a wheelchair, it will be hard to get him out of it.â  Then she cautions him, âDonât fall again, young man. You can recover from a tendon tear, but a shattered hip would be a bigger problem.â Adjusting a new cast that starts at the thigh and ends at the ankle, Sarah releases us with a set of instructions, but it is the word ârecoverâ that braces me through the maneuvers of the trip home.   There are aspects of Donâs care he does not want discussed. We do not discuss them. A proud and fastidious man, he finds his dependency humiliating. The less said the better, I think as I search âhow to give a sponge bath in bedâ online and he researches âhow to use a bed urinal.â There are lists of chores to do: laundry, scheduling appointments with various doctors, making the ground floor habitable since he cannot go upstairs to our bedroom or downstairs to his study.   âHow do you feel?â I whisper.   âIâll take the pain pills now, and the cyanide later,â he deadpans.   In the midst of all these tasks, I realize that my cancer, my ostomy, my medications and my port have dwindled into irrelevance. That I am well enough to be here seems a wonder. In his crumpled state, Don helps me more than I help him.   That night while he slept in a hydrocodone daze, I started stepping around the living room to the stately strains of a Mendelsohn quartet. It was a prayerful dance, asking the powers-that-be for the physical strength to continue doing this good work. On previous nights, last year or the year before, had he done the same? No, it would have been Charlie Parker or Mingus or Ella, and he would never have danced. Yet a look of rapture might have stolen over his face too. A supreme privilege: that I can care for this resolute man who cared for me. When he recovers â not if, I lecture myself — I will investigate how I might proffer help where it is sorely needed. At the hospital, I have seen worn and weary parents, siblings, children, partners and friends of patients with various types of cancers. Perhaps caring for caregivers can function as a form of therapy for people like me. For more fitness, food and wellness news, “like” our Facebook page.
