 Biltong, the strips of cured meat that are a popular snack in South Africa, is often not what it appears to be. Using DNA analysis on biltong, researchers found horse meat labeled as springbok, the native gazelle; giraffe meat labeled as the African antelope, kudu; and in an inexplicable case, kangaroo labeled as ostrich. “For me the saddest finding was to find the Cape mountain zebra, an endangered species, being sold as biltong,” said Maria Eugenia D’Amato, a geneticist at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa and one of the authors of the study, in the journal Investigative Genetics. From a total of 146 samples of biltong, sausage and minced meat, more than a hundred pieces of meat were mislabeled.

The researchers used the meat samples to obtain DNA sequence information from genes that allow for species identification. They compared these DNA bar codes against species information stored in GenBank. Dr. D’Amato said the mislabeling calls for better regulation, to protect both animals and consumers. Similar problems have surfaced in other countries.
