My winning streak as our familyâs champion pie king ended six years ago — and thatâs when all the trouble started. Since going to college down South, I had sat on the holiday pie throne without fear of challenge, learning early what my Tar Heel neighbor Frances Mayes wrote in “Under the Tuscan Sun”: â[P]ecan pie [is] a necessary ingredient of Christmas.â Remaining the king was a result of the time Iâd invested refining my pecan pie recipe — which, if I may — had two outstanding attributes: a generous helping of Kentucky bourbon to cut the treacly sweetness of the Karo syrup and a top secret mixing technique that prevented the pie from becoming gelatinous.  Perfection! And no one dared bring another pecan pie to our familyâs Christmas table. Until 2007, that is, which just happened to be the year I turned 50. That year, my sisterâs wife Maddy invited a new and much younger sister-in-law of hers to our family table. Just married and eight months pregnant, how could we not embrace her? It was all air kisses and mwahs, until Megan murmured, âI brought a pecan pieâ¦.â  At that very moment, I knew Maddy had sold me out. I mean, how could she have failed to disclose to Megan: âOh, only Steven makes the pecan pie in this family.â She might also have added that my pies had seen us through our familyâs ups and downs — from the death of my grandmother (who was known to stick her fork right into the uncut pie and start eating) to the birth of three nieces and a nephew (each celebrated with a pie). Every holiday season, we consumed a delicious slice of our family history along with our calories. Soon enough came dessert, and for the first time in our family we faced two pecan pies on the sideboard â mine crafted with the aforementioned bourbon and a dollop of entitlement, and Meganâs with a dash of bravado and another of comeuppance.  As we ate, Megan launched into a long yarn about how her âheirloom pecansâ came from her great godmother in Lamar, Mo. âEvery year she hand picked them, hand shelled them, and then sent them to me. The magic of her pecans is part of what makes this pie so delicious!” showing absolutely no consideration for her treasonous status. By the time she was finished, I knew I was finished. No matter how delicious my pie, Meganâs family history was about to trump ours, with my very own flesh and blood ready to dethrone me.  And, yes, nearly every one of them voted against me; their forks enthusiastically awarding Megan, the outsider, our familyâs 2007 pecan pie accolade.  The following Christmas, I joined a new family myself, my now-husbandâs big, boisterous clan in Winston-Salem, N.C. His family, which came ready-made with several sisters-in-laws, naturally had its own history and traditions. And it was Sister Lisa, at least a bakerâs dozen years younger than me, who owned the pecan pie trophy. Honestly, I didnât know about that when I offered to bring one of my own prizewinners to Christmas dinner, nor did my new mother-in-law warn me away from pecan to, say, pumpkin. Still, I had learned a thing or two from Megan and her storytelling. And soon enough, Sister Lisaâs pie and my own sat side-by-side on my mother-in-lawâs marble countertop, awaiting their comers. To be fair, Lisaâs was a handsome pie, if not a tad untraditional â made with maple syrup, horrors! — instead of Karo. But it came sans storyline, without history. By contrast, let me just say that the gathering of the pecans in my pie, from a mom and pop farm in Goldsboro, N.C., had a tale of woe like youâve never imagined. It was Rabelaisâs âGargantua and Pantagruelâ all over again, and I told the farmersâ story slowly and carefully: Famine, floods and pestilence! Not to mention I mixed in my own family story, as a way of introducing myself to the new in-laws. By dessertâs end, the voting was in: My pie pan was empty, and poor Lisa went home with a good third of her humble pie. Fast-forward to this yuletide season, where âpecan pieâ is already a trending topic in our family. As the Karo syrup binds the nuts, so, too the pie now does for my clan. Just a couple of weekâs ago Lisa sent me a âhugs and kissesâ Facebook message, ostensibly lamenting our missed visit at Thanksgiving but no doubt trying to decipher whether she or I will bring our prized pies to Mother Helenâs (our shared mother-in-law) on Christmas Day. Weâve learned our lesson: Lisa and I donât ever bring our pies to the same gathering. In fact, sheâs warned me: âI will start a whole new tradition this year and make my Mama’s nine layer chocolate cake. That has a great story and no pecans!â As for the larger lesson, well, thatâs pretty clear now: Itâs not about the bourbon, my secret mixing technique — not even the pedigree of the nuts. Itâs about the life of the pie â the traditions we mix up year after year that, with any luck, bind us together as family. For those of us in middle age, not only do we get to share our recipes, but our family history and stories, too, which seem only to get better with age. To paraphrase the yuletide story, âHappy Christmas to all, and to all a good bite.â 
Steven Petrowâs Bourbon Pecan Pie INGREDIENTS 1 cup dark Karo syrup
1 cup white sugar
3 eggs
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
1/4 cup bourbon (you can use as little as 2 tablespoons if you prefer)
1 teaspoon almond extract
1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cups (about 6 to 7 ounces) whole pecans (the best and freshest you can find; learn as much about them as you can, whether from the farmer or the label)
1 unbaked 9-inch deep pie crust PREPARATION 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  2. Combine the Karo syrup, sugar, eggs, melted butter, bourbon and almond extract. Mix well.  3. Fold in the pecans, making sure theyâre even distributed throughout the filling. Do not over-mix.  4. Pour into the unbaked piecrust. With your fingers, arrange the topmost layer of pecans so that they are lying flat, with the rounded side facing up (no need to become too obsessive). 5. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. 6. Let sit for a couple of hours. Meanwhile, start to talk up the story of your pecans to anyone who will listen. YIELD: 8 servings
