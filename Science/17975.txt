 To the Editor: Re “Rediscovering the First Miracle Drug” (Oct. 5): As a father of a 16-year-old who has lived with diabetes for well over eight years, I recognize that injectable insulin was not a cure, and still isn’t. It is merely life support. But we must recognize that the researchers who discovered insulin paved the way for significant advances that continue to this day — including reformulating the insulin molecule to more closely mimic the workings of a human pancreas. These improvements not only benefit people today but are steps on the road to an artificial pancreas — an automated system that will better manage the blood sugar of people with Type 1 diabetes. Jeffrey Brewer New York The writer is president of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. To the Editor: Access to drugs has evolved considerably since the 1930s, when insulin was purified (to quote “Rediscovering the First Miracle Drug”) from “trainloads of frozen cattle and pig pancreas.” Human insulin, not from animal sources, can now be produced on an industrial scale through genetic engineering of bacteria and even plants like safflower and rice. Surely the “awkward Ontario farm boy” Frederick Banting would have appreciated harvesting the “elusive substance” from rice crops!    Jeffrey H. Toney Union, N.J.
