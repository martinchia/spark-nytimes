Many scientists believe that omega-3 fatty acids, found mostly in fish, can prevent heart disease, so it’s no wonder these fats are being added to all kinds of products. But before you buy the latest omega-3 wonder food, check the label. Some contain a version of the nutrient that may not do you much good at all.  While numerous health claims have been made about omega-3’s, only the heart protection benefits are backed by strong evidence. And  not all omega-3’s are created equal, notes the Center for Science in the Public Interest in the current issue of Nutrition Action Healthletter. The omega-3’s that count are DHA and EPA, the types present in fish and algae. You can get them by eating seafood or taking supplements. But some foods claiming to offer omega-3’s mostly contain a form called ALA, which is naturally present in flaxseed, canola and soy. So far, ALA doesn’t have any proven health benefit, according to David Schardt, senior nutritionist at the center. Hellmannâs Mayonnaise, for instance, boasts that itâs naturally rich in ALA, but researchers disagree as to whether ALA promotes heart health (though there is some evidence that it lowers cholesterol). Of greater concern are studies showing that men who eat lots of ALA have higher rates of advanced prostate cancer. That doesnât mean ALA poses a serious health risk, notes the center, but men shouldnât go out of their way to eat it, either. In any case, many products trumpeting omega-3 fatty acids contain only tiny amounts. Breyerâs adds an algae-based DHA to its Breyerâs Smart! Yogurt. A six-ounce container of Breyer’s Smart! Yogurt has just 32 milligrams of DHA â about as much as youâd get in three-quarters of a teaspoon of salmon. The bottom line is that eating fatty fish twice a week will bring you plenty of DHA and EPA. A six-ounce serving of farmed Atlantic salmon, for instance, contains 3,650 milligrams of these fats. If you don’t like fish or are a vegetarian, consider taking fish oil or algae oil supplements. Comments are no longer being accepted. thanks for this one! This is one of the new buzzowrds on labels I have been wondering about. Please note that fish supplements are no more vegetarian than actual fish.  Thanks. Does anyone know anything about sardines and PCBs? Does it matter where the sardines are “harvested”? Any information would be appreciated. The smarter mercury and calorie free way to get your omega-3 in a supplement capsule. I’m concerned about getting Omega-3s in my diet as a vegetarian, but I’m also warying of everything I eat being supplemented by fish oil- which I don’t eat. I started drinking Silk soy milk with DHA added, but as you point out with Breyer’s yogurt, it only has 32 mg per serving. Not sure how easy algae oil supplements are to find. What about eggs that claim to have omega-3s? Not an answer for vegans, but vegetarians and others who eat eggs may benefit from those? To “Mark Klein, MD”: No, it’s not smarter at all.  Extracted or manufactured supplements don’t account for synergistic interactions that occur when the nutrients in actual food are taken in.  We know that B vitamins improve nutrient absorption, so leafy greens with both B vitamins and iron result in better iron uptake than just an iron supplement. I doubt we’ve discovered all those synergies.  Perhaps we’ve discarded a trace mineral found in fish and algae that unlocks the potential of Omega-3 more effectively than just ingesting the oil itself.  We can’t possibly know that we haven’t overlooked something important. Most of all, how is it that with a billion-dollar supplement industry, we’re still grossly unhealthy as a nation, when cultures with no supplement industry and counterintuitive eating habits have much lower rates of heart disease, high blood pressure, obesity, and high cholesterol? It’s because the pills don’t actually make us any healthier; they just give us more reasons to think less about what we’re eating. As an omnivore with a number of vegetarian and vegan friends, I know that flaxseeds are a great source of vegan omega-3’s.  I love the things, they’re great raw on salads or mixed into hummus, or a shot of flaxseed oil in a smoothie doesn’t add any taste at all.   As for the supplement argument, honestly, I think it cultivates laziness.  Do a little homework, find out what foods are rich in whatever you’re looking for, and eat them!  Not hard! Sorry folks, but nobody really knows anything about what is ‘good’ or bad’ for humans. Dad lived on doughnuts, a pack of camels a day from the age of 15 and   plenty of Jack Daniels for lubrication. He worked at his own gas station and car repair business til well in his 80’s and died at 93. His 3 brothers lived similar life spans with the same tastes. I don’t have to tell anybody about all the folks following the current diet fads, vegetarian or whatever who don’t smoke or drink who drop dead from heart attacks or expire from cancer at a young age. Gary Taubes latest work detailing how the current cholesterol craze became established as ‘gospel’ should be must reading for everybody. The drug industry and their complicit doctors cooked the books on the relation of fat and cholesterol levels as a primary cause of heart disease and heart attacks. This addition of fish oil scares me to death! I have a serious food allergy to all seafood and now have to worry about yogurt, bread, and all the other foods companies decide to add omega-3s to. I am getting very uncomfortable eating anywhere other than my own home.Give me a break. Add your own omega-3s to your diet. It is likely that fish oil supplements extracted from sardines and other smalloily fish have lower mercury content than those from salmon and other large fish.  This is because the large fish eat the small fish and the mercury concentrates in the larger fish.  Some responsible supplement manufacturers put the fish oil through a process designed to remove mercury which is toxic to ingest.  There are also several self-designated “watchdog” organizations which presumably test various brands of supplements for truth in labeling and purity of content.  Given the recent scandals about toxic food products from China and the fact that several vitamin C factories in China were shut down by their govt, even caveat emptor is of little use, since so many food products contain supplements and preservatives from so many different sources and sub-sources, that those manufacturers cannot say with any certainty whether any of their ingredients may come from China.  As for flax seed or flax seed oil, as
mentioned elsewhere, this does not contain the same beneficial oil as
fish does.
Sorry. As an allergist I sympathize with Diane G. Adding fish to dairy, bread and orange juice is ridiculous and dangerous. What’s wrong with a supplement? Apparently, marketing trumps all. “If you donât like fish or are a vegetarian, consider taking fish oil or algae oil supplements.” Vegetarian means no consumption of fish, the writer either rushed this article or isn`t very smart. Eds note: I think most of my readers understood from the structure of the sentence that the fish oil is for people who don’t like fish and the algae oil supplements are for the vegetarians. However, if it was confusing for some, I’m happy to clarify. Thanks for your post. -tpp Re: the above comment that supplements are hard to find… If you live near a city or town with a natural food store such as Whole Foods, they are readily available in the fridge section. There are algae-based and fish-based, plastic and glass containers, small and large, etc. I use a DHA algae one, and put a spoonful on my breakfast every morning, whatever I have, and in salads (I’m vegetarian).  There may be websites you can order from if you are in a rural location. What about the positive Omega 3 claims for grass fed meat and poultry products? Seems like the most natural Omega 3 you could get! Tara, any research about this? There is something fishy about this entire article. It’s commonly accepted that ALA is converted, at least in part, to EPA and DHA (more so in women than men). For example, see this from the University of Maryland: //www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/alpha-linolenic-000284.htm So to say that ALA has no known health benefits seems incorrect. Hi Tara,
Regarding Fish Oil… I take 2 capsules 3x per day as directed by my Neurologist. I’ve been recently diagnosed with MS and even went as far as having all the metal fillings removed from my teeth and replaced with the white stuff (I forgot the name). My Neurologist didn’t reccommend this, I was just told and read that it’s best not to have any mercury. So I know fish oil is good for you, but is there mercury in it that can be bad for you? Especially someone like me who takes 2 caps 3x per day? Please let me know… Chris wrote: There is something fishy about this entire article.

It is also commonly accepted that very little ALA gets converted to EPA (5-10%) and even less gets converted to DHA (0-5%).  DHA is the “grand-daddy” of all omega-3s.   It is the longest chain omega-3 and the one that has been shown to have the most benefits.  EPA by itself hasn’t been shown to have many benefits (only benefits are in conjunction with DHA) but DHA by itself has been shown to many health benefits.  Of all the omega-3s in our brain, over 90% is DHA and of all the omega-3s in our eyes, over 97% is DHA.  A deficiency in DHA has been linked to a lot of health problems. Vegetarians can get their DHA intake from algae oil.  Flaxseed, canola oil, and other sources of ALA won’t get vegetarians the DHA they need, even through bioconversion.  They must eat sources that contain DHA.  I recommend Silk Soymilk Plus w/DHA, Gold Circle Eggs, Minute Maid Enhanced Pomegranate/Blueberry Juice, and many other foods that are fortified with algae oil.  Look for the life’sDHA symbol on the food.  It is the only algae oil that I know of that is used in foods in the US. The Mayo Clinic website indicates,
“Prostate cancer (flaxseed, not flaxseed oil)
There is limited research of the effects of flaxseed or alpha-linolenic acid (which is in flaxseed) on the risk of developing prostate cancer. This area remains controversial. Some studies report that a low-fat diet supplemented with flaxseed can lower levels of the blood marker prostate specific antigen (PSA), both in men with enlarged prostate glands and in those with prostate cancer. However, these effects may be due to the effects of fat reduction, and the role of flaxseed in these cases is not clear. Other research in large populations has looked at dietary habits and cancer risk, and has suggested that higher levels of alpha-linolenic acid may be associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer. Overall, it remains unclear whether flax or flaxseed oil plays a role in the prevention or treatment of prostate cancer.” In your discussion you are insufficiently clear as to what ALA you are referring to when you, in effect, scare the Hell out of men who are using ALA, almost all of whom are using capsules and are not eating flaxseed. Perhaps you might want to clear that up. Isn’t it interesting how we just keep getting shuffled from one micronutrient to the next?  Seems clear to me that focusing on such micronutrients to promote health is misguided.  A balanced preferably plant-based diet is the way to go.  It’d do humanity and the environment much good if we could just focus on getting back to basics. //www.foodkarmaalert.blogspot.com Does any one know about the Omega 3 value in walnuts as compared to flax seed?  I’m eight months pregnant with my third child, the supplements make me ill and any amount of mercury in fish is not acceptable to me. It’s too bad flax seed appears not to be a great alternative, I don’t think the article said any thing about walnuts. About eggs with omega-3, that may be because the chicken feed contains fish products, so if you are a vegetarian, those are off limits. All Omega-3s start in the green leaves of plants and algae. That’s why actual grass-fed beef is higher in Omega 3s, and that’s why ACTUAL free range eggs (not industrial eggs that get marketed as free range) are higher in omega 3s.  Livestock and poultry that eat grains are much higher in Omega 6s (makes sense, since omega 6s originate in grains). As more fish get fed grain instead of their natural diets, they’ll have fewer omega 3s, as well. Lots of smart thinkers are now looking at the ratio between omega 6s and omega 3s- it may be that this ratio is far more important than the amount of omega 3s specifically. That’s why all of this marketing around omega 3s is nothing but nonsense. Well, nonsense and profits. fish oil made for food use is not considered an allergen because it is a highly refined, bleached and deodorized product. In this process protein is removed and it falls under the same guidlines that govern a refined soy bean oil. Those with allergens to fish may not need to be concerned about highly refined fish oil.  JMI Re the question about the type of omega-3 found in walnuts: plant-based omega-3 fats found in flax, hemp, walnuts, soy, canola, etc. is all the same fatty acid molecule called alpha linolenic acid (ALA). The omega-3 fats found in fish and algae are DHA and EPA (which can be synthesized from ALA in the body but at a very inefficient rate). I’m under the impression that salmon is a cold-water fish and not susceptible to mercury pollution under normal circumstances.  If I’m mistaken I would appreciate clarification.
