 These are based on the classic biscotti de Prato, but they are much less sweet and made with whole wheat flour and almond flour. Cut them in thin slices on the diagonal and dip them in tea, coffee or wine. 250 grams (approximately 2 cups) whole wheat flour 60 grams (approximately 2/3 cup) almond flour 5 grams (approximately 1 teaspoon) baking powder 1/8 teaspoon (pinch) of salt 125 grams (approximately 2/3 cup, tightly packed) organic brown sugar 165 grams (3 large) eggs 5 grams (approximately 1 teaspoon) vanilla extract 100 grams almonds, toasted and chopped (approximately 3/4 cup chopped) Advertisement 1. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Whisk together the flour, almond flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Advertisement 2. In the bowl of a stand mixer, or in a large bowl with a whisk or electric beater, beat together the sugar and eggs for 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beaters. Add the vanilla and beat for another minute. Turn off the mixer, scrape down the bowl and beaters, and add the flour mixture. Mix in at low speed until combined. The batter will be sticky. Add the almonds and mix until well combined.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.

Moisten your hands so the dough won’t stick, and form a log, about 12 inches long by 2 1/2 inches wide. Repeat with the other half of the batter. The logs can be on the same baking sheet but make sure there is at least two inches of space between them. 4. Place in the oven and bake 50 minutes, until lightly browned and dry. Remove from the oven and let sit on a rack for 20 minutes (or longer). Place the logs on a cutting board and slice thin, about 1/3 inch, either straight across the logs (for more, but smaller biscotti) or on the diagonal (for more traditionally shaped biscotti). 5. Place the cookies on baking sheets and return one sheet at a time to the middle rack of the oven. Bake 15 minutes. Flip the cookies over and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes, until hard and lightly browned. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Yield: 5 dozen smaller cookies (cut across the log) Advance preparation: You can bake the logs a day ahead and slice and double bake the cookies the next day. Biscotti keep for a couple of weeks in a tin or a jar. Martha Rose Shulman is the author of “The Very Best of Recipes for Health.”  We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
