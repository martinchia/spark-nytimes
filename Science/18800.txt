 TO THE EDITOR: Re “Along Came a Spider” (Sept. 17): Yes, black widow spiders really are shy. Many years ago I lived in Arizona, in a house trailer. One day, while opening an outside panel covering the water faucet, I saw a web with a black widow spider inside. I jumped back, and the spider immediately ran far back in its web. I turned on the faucet, went back to watering my plants and replaced the panel. From that day on, whenever I opened the panel, the spider would retreat back into its web. We coexisted until it was my time to leave Arizona. Norbett Mintz Lexington, Mass.   A version of this letter appears in print on October 1, 2013, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: Spiders Want to Be Left Alone.
