 Some researchers say Hurricane Sandy should prompt scientists to devise new methods to categorize coastal storms. S. Jeffress Williams, a coastal scientist with the United States Geological Survey and the University of Hawaii, noted that Sandy was barely a Category 1 hurricane — the weakest — on the widely used Saffir-Simpson scale, which measures hurricane intensity largely according to wind speeds. But, Mr. Williams said, its low barometric pressure increased the height of its storm surge, and its immense size widened its impact. Researchers are already calling Sandy “the storm of record,” on the East Coast, surpassing even the notorious Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962. That storm, a northeaster, sat off the Atlantic coast for days in March, slamming the beaches again and again through five high tides. The 1962 storm is a landmark in coastal geology. Studies in its aftermath were the first to demonstrate systematically that developed beaches suffer more than pristine stretches when storms strike. That seems to be the case with Sandy, according to Cheryl J. Hapke, a coastal geologist with the Geological Survey, who is studying conditions on Fire Island, N.Y. Preliminary surveys suggest the storm moved “a huge amount of sand” off the beaches, she said. In park areas, where there is little infrastructure, dunes 3 to 5 yards high appear to have shifted 25 or 30 yards inland, she said. In developed areas, sand also moved inland, but “there is no dune remaining.” We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think. Go to Home Page »
