 To the Editor: The column on Mary Anning, “Tale of an Unsung Fossil Finder, in Fact and Fiction” (Books on Science, Feb. 2), reminds me of another woman, also of about the same time. She also was an English scientist and was rebuffed by male scientists. She was the first to discover that a lichen was not a single organism, but a symbiosis, and had learned that fact and others by her careful and lovely watercolors. Taken to the Royal Botanic Gardens, she was ignored. Male scientists knew she could draw well, but she could not (of course) “do” science. However, a paper she wrote on the germination of spores of Agaricineae was read at the Linnnean meetings. She never published that paper, or any other scientific work. The young lichenologist found another occupation, and was so successful in her new work, that Beatrix Potter bought a farm from the royalties from “The Tale of Peter Rabbit.” Carl W.
