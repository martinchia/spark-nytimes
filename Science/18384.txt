 It looks like a plastic bag, but in fact the PeePoo is a single-use biodegradable toilet for the developing world. After it is used, the bag is knotted and then buried or sold back to the manufacturer. A lining of urea crystals in the bag helps transform the waste into fertilizer. By one United Nations estimate, about 40 percent of the world’s population — 2.6 billion people — does not have access to a toilet. Open defecation leads to contaminated water and diarrhea. About 1.5 million children die of diarrhea every year. The PeePoo’s creator is Anders Wilhelmson, a Swedish architect and professor. While taking his students on study trips in Asia and Africa, he decided that urban slum populations needed toilets even more than they needed housing. Currently, about 6,000 PeePoo bags are produced every day and distributed in slums in Nairobi, Kenya. Advertisement Mr. Wilhelmson has set up a Tupperware-style business model. After some training, women sell the bags to customers in their communities. Mr. Wilhelmson’s company buys back the used bags for a third of the original price, and the waste is turned into fertilizer.

The need for toilets is a basic one that will never cease to exist, he said. “You do it, I do it, we all do it,” he said. “We all have the same digestive system.” A version of this article appears in print on September 27, 2011, on Page D4 of the New York edition with the headline: The PeePoo.
