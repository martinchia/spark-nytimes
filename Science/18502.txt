 To the Editor: “Rocket Plunge to Deep End of the Planet” (March 20), about James Cameron’s ambitious plan to explore the deepest part of the ocean, omits one important aspect of this epic journey. Much of the Mariana Trench is protected as the Mariana Trench Marine National Monument. Managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, this conservation area is part of the 150-million-acre National Wildlife Refuge System. Along with iconic places like the Arctic refuge area in Alaska, it is a legacy of President Theodore Roosevelt, who established the first wildlife refuges.
