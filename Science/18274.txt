 The use of acetaminophen in the first year of life is associated with an increased risk for asthma, eczema and allergic runny nose later in childhood, a New Zealand study reports. Acetaminophen is sold in the United States  under the brand name Tylenol and as an ingredient in many other pain relievers. The study, published in the Sept. 20 issue of The Lancet, included data from more than 190,000 6- and 7-year-old children in 28 countries whose parents had responded to questionnaires about various health and diet practices. After controlling for numerous factors, including breast-feeding, antibiotic use and parental smoking, they found that children given acetaminophen before age 1 had an almost 50 percent increased risk for asthma, eczema and allergy compared with those given none. “We can’t be certain that acetaminophen is a cause,” said a co-author, Tadd Clayton of the University of Auckland. “We can only say that it is associated. People should continue to follow the recommendation of the W.H.O., which is that acetaminophen should be reserved for children with a high fever, 101.3 degrees or more.” The study is large, but the medical information was obtained from parents after the fact, and children with asthma and related illnesses may be more likely to be treated with acetaminophen in the first place.
