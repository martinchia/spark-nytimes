 Cabbages and other cruciferous plants contain the raw ingredients for chemical warfare: glucosinolates and an enzyme, myrosinase. The chemicals are kept apart in the plant tissue, but when the tissues are crushed (as when bitten by an insect) they mix and toxic mustard oil is produced. Researchers have likened these plants to mustard-oil bombs, because the lethal chemicals are always at the ready. Now it appears that an insect that munches on them, the cabbage aphid, is a mobile version of the same thing, a walking bomb that can kill ladybugs and other enemies. It has been known that cabbage aphids can take up glucosinolates (and their bite is so delicate that they don’t set off the plant’s bomb). These aphids also produce a form of myrosinase. And as in the plants, the two compounds are stored separately. So they only mix when the aphid is attacked and wounded. Glen Powell of Imperial College London and colleagues have now shown, in a paper in The Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, that this chemical warfare system does in fact serve a defensive purpose. Aphids raised on a diet containing 1 percent sinigrin, a kind of glucosinolate, were toxic to ladybugs, while those raised without sinigrin were not. What’s more, only those aphids that were wingless (as a certain percentage are) stored the sinigrin. “The ones that don’t have wings are stuck on the plant,” Dr. Powell said. “Really their only defense is to store up these chemicals.” But the winged aphids don’t have as much need for the chemicals. “Obviously they have other ways of escaping,” he said. A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F3 of the New York edition with the headline: Cabbage Aphids Found To Be Walking Bombs Full of Lethal Chemicals.
