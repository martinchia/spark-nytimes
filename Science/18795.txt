 Ground level Demolition zone FLOOR COLUMN EXTENDED JACK   JACK FOUNDATION One Japanese company has developed a bottom-up method, in which all the demolition work is done at or near ground level.   1 Columns are separated from foundation and supported by jacks.   4 Floor and walls are demolished. Process is repeated for each floor.   3 Jacks lower all the columns simultaneously until floor reaches ground. 2 Segments are removed from each column in sequence; jacks are raised. ANOTHER METHOD SCAFFOLD LOWER SUPPORTS brace the column as floors above are demolished. UPPER SUPPORTS move with the jacks and brace the columns as the cap is lowered. The strand jack works by gripping and ungripping cables that run through it. This allows both the column and the jack itself to move. The scaffold is a lightweight structure and is covered with panels that mimic the facade so the building looks normal. CABLES are tied to the column. RAMPS let equipment move to the next floor. CRANES generate electricity for the lighting as debris is lowered. EXCAVATORs and other heavy equipment cut steel and break up concrete. A CAP FOR THE WORK CONCRETE AND STEEL STRUCTURE TEMPORARY  COLUMNS Floor plan Building section TEMPORARY COLUMN LOWER GRIP UPPER GRIP HYDRAULIC CYLINDER STEEL CABLES CAP EXTERIOR As the Akasaka Prince Hotel is being demolished, the work is hidden from view by a scaffold that hangs from the roof. The structure is supported by 15 temporary columns and is lowered  by computer-controlled jacks. DEMOLITION  SEQUENCE STRAND JACKS Each temporary column  has a strand jack. 4 Next two floors are ready to be demolished. 3 Temporary columns are jacked down, lowering the cap. 2 Slabs, beams and facade are demolished, two floors at a time.   1 Scaffold is hung from roof, forming a cap over the top floors.
