 To the Editor: Re “About Death, Just Like Us or Pretty Much Unaware?” (Basics, Sept. 2): If Natalie Angier’s article was trying to show how animals are different from people in their attitude toward death, I think it achieved just the opposite. It showed — in a very informative and vivid way — how animals, like people, are confused beings not equipped to cope with the concept of death. The last line of the article, intended to show how perhaps elephants don’t quite get death after all, is a word for word description of what human grief is: “They were saying goodbye, or maybe, Won’t you please come back home?”  Eyal Nevo New York To the Editor: It isn’t surprising that the more intelligent animals understand death. What makes our species unique is that we understand our own mortality. We live most of our lives knowing that we are going to die someday. That is probably the thing that truly sets us apart from any animal.   Glenn Mazzei New London, Conn. Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
