 THE FACTS For about as long as television has been around, people have speculated that too much exposure to it can harm children's brains. So it was perhaps no surprise when a large study two years ago found that children who watched the most television also had the shortest attention spans. In some cases, all it took was an extra hour of television viewing a day to increase the odds of developing concentration problems by 10 percent, the researchers found. But parents who cringed at those findings can breathe a little easier. In the last two years, two other studies have failed to find any link between television exposure and symptoms of attention-deficit disorder. The most recent, published this month in the journal Pediatrics, based its findings on a group of 5,000 American kindergartners who were followed for two years. The researchers found that children who watched the most television were no more likely to develop attention problems than those who watched the least television. The other study, in the Netherlands, also found no relationship. But researchers say more study is needed. THE BOTTOM LINE The link between exposure to television and decreased attention spans in children may not be as strong as once thought.
