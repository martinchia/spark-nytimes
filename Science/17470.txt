 Maybe optimistic men have good reason to feel cheerful. A new study suggests that they may be less likely to die from cardiovascular disease than men who are less hopeful. Dutch researchers based their findings on a study that followed the health of 545 Dutch men, ages 64 to 84, over a 15-year period. The report appears in The Archives of Internal Medicine. In addition to keeping track of the men's physical health, the researchers gave them a questionnaire every five years that assessed their outlook on life. The men were asked whether they agreed with statements like "I still expect much from life" or "I am still full of plans." The most optimistic men had a 50 percent lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease over the 15 years than the least optimistic men.

"The intriguing question," the authors of this study wrote, "is how low optimism may lead to cardiovascular death."
