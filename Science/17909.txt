 To the Editor: Having just read “When Weight Is the Issue, Doctors Struggle Too” (18 and Under, July 21) I can’t help but notice that a registered dietitian is never mentioned. Just as I, a pediatric registered dietitian, should not feel comfortable discussing medication options with a patient, a doctor should know when to refer out as well. No one is expected to handle every issue a patient may have, and this is why a “medical team” is essential. A registered dietitian is the expert when it comes to obesity management.
