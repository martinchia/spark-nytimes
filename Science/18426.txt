 To the Editor: Re “Medical Radiation Soars, With Risks Often Overlooked” (Personal Health, Aug. 21): In recent years, radiation dose has declined dramatically because of a substantial industry investment in dose-reduction features and techniques on CT imaging equipment. Recent allegations that medical imaging utilization and associated radiation exposure are “soaring” are unfounded. In fact, recent data show that use of advanced imaging modalities is declining, as validated by several recent independent analyses of Medicare and private insurance data.    Gail M.
