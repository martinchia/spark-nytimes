 To the Editor: Re “New Threat Rises Between Mammograms” (Vital Signs, May 10): I disagree that the way to combat interval tumors is with better screening. Breast cancer is not a linear disease, and finding a tumor early does not ensure successful treatment. Early detection does not always save lives. We need to focus our resources differently. It’s time to find ways to prevent tumors from metastasizing, so that no one dies from breast cancer, and ways to prevent breast cancer altogether. Elizabeth Wohl East Hampton, N.Y.
