 THE FACTS With so many questions surrounding hormone replacement therapy, alternative remedies for hot flashes have become increasingly popular. But few if any have solid scientific weight behind them, and flaxseed supplements appear to be no exception. Flaxseed contains lignans, estrogenlike compounds that in theory might ease hot flashes just as hormone therapy does. High in fiber, omega-3 fatty acids and other nutrients, the seeds are often ground up and sold in powder form for easier digestion. In one study at the Mayo Clinic, researchers looked at the effectiveness of flaxseed by recruiting a group of 30 women who had been having more than a dozen hot flashes per week and were not taking estrogen. For the first week, the women were simply told to keep diaries detailing their hot flashes and quality of life. Then, they were given ground flaxseed and told to mix two tablespoons into juice, yogurt or fruit twice a day for six weeks. At the end of the study, the women reported a drop in the frequency and intensity of their hot flashes. But many experienced bloating and other gastrointestinal side effects. Researchers at the University of Calgary studied what happened when women experiencing hot flashes began eating foods with large amounts of ground flaxseed, soy flour or a placebo. After 16 weeks, they found that neither flaxseed nor soy had any significant effect on their symptoms. THE BOTTOM LINE Studies have not borne out the effectiveness of flaxseed to ease hot flashes. scitimes@nytimes.com A version of this article appears in print on March 22, 2011, on Page D5 of the New York edition with the headline: THE CLAIM: Eating Flaxseed Can Help Relieve Hot Flashes.
