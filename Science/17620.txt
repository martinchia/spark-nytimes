 To the Editor: “Mirrors Don't Lie. Mislead? Oh, Yes” (Basics, July 22) missed the most fascinating puzzle about the link of these eternally fascinating surfaces and our minds: Why do see our faces flipped left to right in the mirror, but not turned upside down? Samuel BertieCambridge, Mass. Science Times sent this question to Marco Bertamini of the University of Liverpool, one of the experts quoted in “Mirrors Don’t Lie.” His reply follows. The question of why mirrors invert left and right but not up and down is indeed a classic puzzle. Richard Gregory traced back its history at least to Plato. It has been answered differently by physicists philosophers, psychologists and others (to name some: Gregory, Feynman, Kant, Martin Gardner), though in part the differences may be in the language used. In my opinion the main controversy is which is the best way to explain the answer rather than what is the key source of the problem. The transformation that maps an object to its virtual copy (its enantiomorph) involves the depth dimension (the z-axis). After the transformation what is up remains up, what is down remains down, but also what is left remains left and what is right remains right. Advertisement For example, our left eye and the corresponding virtual object are both on our left. So in that sense nothing is left right reversed. Advertisement Real and virtual objects are different in the way that left and right hands are different. The hands are not the left right reversal of each other, they are different objects that cannot be made to match by any rigid motion in 3D. In theory we should be able to imagine the type of relationship between an object and its virtual copy (two 3D objects) if we could move into 4D, but that is beyond anybody’s imagination! What we should not do is to think about walking around to the back of the mirror, as this is a different type of transformation. These few lines are unlikely to have closed the argument. No doubt people will continue to debate this puzzle for a long time to come.  To the Editor: It’s not only people who can be seduced by mirrors. I have an outdoor sculpture that includes a small mirror, and the other day I saw a squirrel sitting on top of the sculpture, looking at itself. I could have sworn it was smiling, and at one point, even kissed the mirror!  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

After the squirrel walked away, sure enough, there was an imprint on the mirror where the squirrel’s lips touched it.

The finished work was on display in the lobby. Though many people told me what a good likeness it was, I thought it only vaguely resembled me. When we hung the picture at home, it happened to be reflected in a mirror. It was not until I saw it in the mirror that I realized it was an excellent likeness indeed. Edith BrentSan Jose, Calif. To the Editor: Re “Mirrors Don’t Lie. Mislead? Oh, Yes? (Basics, July 22): There is a simpler explanation to why we do not see our mirror image upside down than that given by Prof. Marco Bertamini. Suppose you hold your right hand up to the mirror with your palm facing the mirror. You will see the palm of your hand in the mirror and your thumb will point to your left. The outline of your hand seen in the mirror will be the same as the outline of the back of your real hand. There is a front to back exchange. Advertisement To appear upside down, the mirror would have to rotate us 180 degrees about a horizontal axis. If the mirror somehow rotated our image 180 degrees about a vertical axis, we would see our back side in the mirror. Neither rotation occurs.

To the Editor: Re “Why do we see our faces flipped from left to right in the mirror, but not upside down?” New York Magazine years ago ran a contest to supply the most succinct answer to just that. I recall the winning statement to be elegant in its brevity: “Because up and down are absolute directions, while left and right are conventions.” Taking north as an absolute direction, one standing before a mirror with his finger pointing north will see his reflected image pointing north as well.
