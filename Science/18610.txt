 Scientists have discovered a snail with a glasslike, translucent shell living half a mile below the surface in Croatia. Just a millimeter across and practically immobile, the snail, Zospeum tholussum, makes its home in a hot, humid cave within the Lukina Jama-Trojama cave system. Alexander Weigand of Goethe-University in Frankfurt, Germany, described the snail in the journal Subterranean Biology. A version of this article appears in print on September 24, 2013, on Page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: Discovery: Small, Slimy and See-Through.
