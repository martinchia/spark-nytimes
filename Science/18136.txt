 To the Editor: Re “New Sphere in Exploring the Abyss” (Aug. 26): I am heartened by the push to deeper ocean frontiers promised by the development of the new subs. Every such exploration yields unimagined life forms and provides us astronomers a greater hope that life will be found on the bizarre exoplanets we are finding. At the same time I am saddened by the struggle to find the $25 million to finish the project in a timely manner. We spend that much money in Iraq in less than two  hours. One can only dream of what wonderful intellectual and practical returns U.S. science could provide with comparable investment.  Daniel B. Caton Boone, N.C.
