Solve a medical mystery with Dr. Lisa Sanders. The Challenge: A 74-year-old mechanic begins to feel short of breath when he works under cars. Can you figure out why? Every month, the Diagnosis column of The New York Times Magazine asks Well readers to solve a real-life diagnostic mystery. Below you will find the details of a case involving a car mechanic who gradually starts to feel short of breath when he works underneath cars. Iâll give you the same information the doctor was given before he made the diagnosis. Will you be able to do the same?  As usual, the first reader to submit the correct diagnosis gets a signed copy of my book, âEvery Patient Tells a Story,â and the pleasure of puzzling out a tough but interesting case. The Patient’s Story âI canât hardly work anymore,â the 74-year-old man said to Dr. Stephen Workman, an internist at Dalhousie University School of Medicine in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was a mechanic, he explained to Dr. Workman and the second-year resident working with him. He ran his own shop, had for years, but recently it had become increasingly tough for him to do his job. Every time he got under the car and started to work, heâd get completely out of breath.  âYou know when someone hits you and knocks the wind out of you? Thatâs what it feels like,â he told the doctors. It didnât bother him most of the time, just when he went under the car. Itâs hard to be a mechanic if you canât get under the car, he added. It started the year before. At first it was just a feeling of being somewhat uncomfortable lying under the car. If he changed his position a little it seemed to ease up a bit. But over time it got worse.  Recently he had gotten the same feeling of being out of breath when he was helping a friend insulate his cabin. He was squatting next to the soffit, stuffing the insulation into the space between the wall and the room when suddenly he had this same sense of being winded. âAnd thereâs one other time,â the man continued thoughtfully. âI canât have sex with my wife and be on the bottom. It makes me feel like Iâm going to pass right out.â He went to his regular doctor, who looked him over. When his primary care doctor didnât find anything on exam, he ordered some blood tests, a chest X-ray and an ultrasound of his abdomen. None of them shed any light on the problems. So he sent him to the university clinic to see a specialist.  You can see the referral letter and the results of the tests here. 
            Results of the patientâs tests.         The Patient’s History The resident had already seen and examined the patient, but she had no idea what might be going on. So Dr. Workman came in to see if he could figure it out.  The patient was a small well-built man with bright blue eyes and a quick smile that revealed well cared for teeth. He had a little high blood pressure and a problem with his cholesterol but he always felt fine — at least until he hit 72. He had never smoked, didnât drink and looked after himself pretty well, he told them. Then this started. It was aggravating.  âIf I know what the problem is, I can deal with it,” he told the two doctors. “But I have to know whatâs going on. Iâve always been that way.â Just walk me through exactly what happens, Dr. Workman said as he settled down into a chair across from the patient. Take your time. Tell me everything. It was only when he was lying on his back that he felt this pressure in his abdomen and this feeling like he couldnât get enough air, the patient said. It would get better as soon as he sat up and usually felt better if he could lie on his side, âbut you canât work on a car like that.â The feeling got even worse when he actually started working on the car. Walking didnât make him feel short of breath; he felt fine even going up the stairs. He had no chest pain or tightness, no jaw pain and didnât break out into a cold sweat or anything when he was lying on his back. He just felt like he couldnât breathe. The resident was stumped, but Dr. Workman still had a couple of tricks up his sleeve. And before the patient went home that night, he had a diagnosis. Solving the Mystery My challenge to you is twofold: Can you tell me what test gave Dr. Workman the answer he sought? And what did the patient have that was giving him this shortness of breath?
