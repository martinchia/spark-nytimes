 A new family of limbless, tail-less amphibians has been discovered in northeastern India. Over the course of five years, researchers identified five species belonging to the family in 250 locations throughout the vast region. The amphibians are burrowers, spending their entire lives underground. “The complete life cycle, everything, is happening under the soil,” said S. D. Biju, an environmental scientist at the University of Delhi who led the research. “So far we don’t have much information about feeding; we think they eat earthworms.” Dr. Biju and his colleagues named the new family Chikilidae and describe it in The Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The amphibians look like earthworms themselves, or small snakes, though they are not poisonous. Unlike worms, they also have strong backbones.

Dr. Biju said the discovery underscored the need for amphibian conservation in India, where larger, charismatic species like the tiger and the elephant get far more attention.
