 How fast do we slow down? If running speed were proportional to time, the increase in time for every equal lap would be exactly 2: that is, doubling the distance would correspond to a doubling of time. But of course the number is greater than 2, corresponding to the increased difficulty of longer runs. You can see this by making a graph, plotting world running times against distance, in races ranging from the 100-meter dash through middle-distance races like the 400- and 800-meter and the mile, up through marathons and ultramarathons. For each doubling of distance, the world record time is multiplied by about 2.15. More precisely, Sandra Savaglio and Vincenzo Carbone published a paper in the journal Nature in 2000 showing two regimes: for sprints of 200 meters to 1,000 meters, a doubling of distance corresponds to an increase of a factor of 2.3 in world record running times; for longer distances from 1,000 meters to the marathon, a doubling of distance increases the time by a factor of 2.1. They found similar patterns for men and women, and for swimming as well as running. A version of this brief appears in print on March 19, 2013, on Page D7 of the New York edition with the headline: 2.15.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
