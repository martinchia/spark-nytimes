 To the Editor: Re “Are Scientists Playing God? It Depends on Your Religion” (Findings, Nov. 20): John Tierney’s account of the East-West divide regarding stem cell research is exactly parallel to my experience of an East-West divide regarding public acceptance of evolution. Religious/philosophical traditions that emphasize continuity, connectedness and —  not coincidentally — compassion have little difficulty acknowledging the fundamental unity of all living things, by contrast with the exclusivist Western perspective. It is also interesting that while both approaches cling to the unsubstantiated notion of a divine soul, only the latter insists that it is unique to human beings. David P. BarashRedmond, Wash.  To the Editor: Most of the discussion in “Playing God” was beside the point. Opposition to cloning has largely to do with widespread belief that humans are special members of the natural order. If Eastern religions are more receptive to cloning, it is because they tend to view you and me not as human organisms,  but as spirits who inhabit organisms. This is the basis for belief in reincarnation — and a very strange basis for scientific policy. William JaworskiMaplewood, N.J.
