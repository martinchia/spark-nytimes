But in this case I used the toaster oven to roast the mushrooms. You’ll need only half of the roasted mushrooms for 1 sandwich but you’ll find a good use for the rest of them, I’m sure. Total time: About 30 minutes 1/2 pound mushrooms (white or cremini), sliced 2 tablespoons plus 1/2 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves Salt and freshly ground pepper 2 slices whole-grain bread (3 ounces) 1 garlic clove, cut in half (optional) 2 teaspoons minced chives Handful of arugula 3/4 ounce grated Gruyère cheese (3 tablespoons 1. Preheat oven or toaster oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Toss mushrooms with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and thyme leaves and spread in an even layer on the baking sheet. Place in oven and roast for 15 to 20 minutes, stirring halfway through, or until mushrooms are bubbling and moist. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper. 2. If desired, rub one side of each slice of bread with the cut clove of garlic. 3. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the cheese over 1 of the slices (on the side you rubbed with garlic). Top with half the mushrooms (use the other half for another sandwich or another recipe). Sprinkle chives over the mushrooms and top with a handful of arugula and remaining cheese. Top with remaining slice of bread (garlic-rubbed side down) and press down firmly. Drizzle remaining olive oil over top slice. 4. Toast in toaster oven 3 to 4 minutes, until cheese melts. Remove from heat, press down firmly, cut in half and serve. Note: If you are worried about cheese oozing out onto your toaster oven’s heating element (the burnt cheese smells horrible), then place on a baking sheet. Toast for 3 minutes, then flip over and toast 1 minute more. You can also make this in a panini grill. Yield: Serves 1 Advance preparation: You can assemble this sandwich and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for up to a day. Toast when ready.
