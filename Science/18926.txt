Advertisement Supported by Recipes for Health By Martha Rose Shulman I love watermelon and feta salad, whether the watermelon is grilled or not. The sweet, juicy watermelon against the salty, creamy feta and pungent onions is a winning combination. This version introduces heat and char. Throw the watermelon slices, with the rind, onto the grill after or before youâ€™ve grilled your meat or fish or vegetables. Grill them on both sides until just charred, then cut away the rinds and dice up the melon for the salad. Time: About 10 minutes 1 small red onion, sliced 3 large or 4 smaller 1-inch-thick slices watermelon 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar Salt to taste 2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint 2 ounces feta cheese, crumbled 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon Aleppo pepper or mild chili powder (to taste) 1. Place sliced onion in a bowl and cover with water and 1 teaspoon of the vinegar. Soak 5 minutes, then drain and rinse. Spread on paper towels. 2. Prepare a medium-hot grill. Use 1 tablespoon of the olive oil to brush the watermelon slices lightly. Grill for about 3 minutes per side, or until charred. Remove from heat and dice. Transfer, with juice, to a large salad bowl. 3. Add onions and remaining ingredients and toss together. Let sit for a few minutes or for up to an hour before serving. Toss again just before serving. Yield: Serves 4 Advance preparation: The completed salad can be made an hour or two before serving. Or you can grill the watermelon right before you assemble and serve the salad so that the watermelon is hot.
