 Several makers of children’s vaccines announced Monday that they would lower prices in the world’s poorest countries, a move that could save donors billions of dollars and help bring the vaccines to more children (above, a polio vaccination in Congo). GlaxoSmithKline cut the price of its rotavirus vaccine by two-thirds. Merck offered to do the same with its cervical cancer vaccine and to reduce the cost of its rotavirus vaccine by an unspecified amount. Indian companies like the Serum Institute and Panacea Biotec said they would cut their prices on a vaccine protecting against five diseases. The announcement — made jointly by vaccine manufacturers and the GAVI Alliance, which collects donor money — comes in anticipation of a pledging conference in London next Monday at which GAVI hopes to raise at least $4 billion. It also comes 10 days after the United Nations Children’s Fund — which actually orders and distributes the vaccines bought by GAVI — for the first time publicly posted the prices it paid each year for the last decade. That revealed wide disparities in prices charged by manufacturers and showed that prices drop when Indian competitors enter the field. Daniel Berman, deputy director of the global access campaign for Doctors Without Borders, said the cuts “will really make a difference.” He did not know how much Unicef’s disclosure influenced the cuts, but said donors have a “growing awareness” of paying unnecessarily high prices.
