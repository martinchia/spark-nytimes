 To the Editor: Re “Whales’ Lower-Pitch Sound Has Experts Guessing” (July 29): When humans attempt to communicate on a noisy or cluttered radio channel, they may change frequencies to get better reception. Whales communicate largely in the frequency range of 20 to 100 hertz. Shipping noise occurs largely in the same frequency range. A steady increase in shipping traffic worldwide over the last six or seven decades can only have made communication on the whales’ “channel” increasingly noisy, cluttered and difficult. Are whales lowering the pitch of their communications in order to get below the frequency range of shipping? Paul R. OgushwitzHackettstown, N.J. Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
