Carry the One Several sets of gears and wires labeled “Carriage” allow multiple wheels to be turned when a digit wheel turns above 9 or below 0. For example,
                                                adding the number 1 to 999 involves turning several wheels at the same time to produce 1000. Multiply and Divide Groups of gears marked T are used during multiplication and division. Read and Write Numbers moving to and from the mill pass through these wheels, which act as a buffer. Memory Storage and Retrieval Between mathematical operations, numbers are stored in stacks of numbered wheels. Racks of metal with teeth along each long edge mesh with the
                                                wheels and transfer numbers to and from the stacks. Decimals are stored in tall stacks of 41 wheels, each wheel rotated to show a single digit from 0 to 9. Each stack marked V stores a 40-digit number and its positive or
                                                negative sign. The small mark  shows which column represents the number. Sources: "Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine, 1838," by Allan G. Bromley; Annals of the History of Computing
