Whether to seek an autopsy isn’t something we think about when a loved one is ill. But as today’s Second Opinion column by Denise Grady explains, an autopsy isn’t just about medical answers. it’s about reassurance. My sister had barely taken her last breath when a nurse appeared in the doorway of her room in the intensive care unit and asked if our family wanted an autopsy. We looked at each other, my surviving sister and I, and said no. It wouldnât bring her back. We had had enough. We wanted to get on with funeral plans….Almost a year later questions remain, and I find myself wondering what an autopsy might have found. If Iâd thought it through beforehand, I might have given that nurse a different answer. But I never expected my sisterâs life to end the way it did.  Read the full story, “The Autopsy, a Search for Reassurance,” and then please join the discussion below. Have you found in yourself in a similar situation after losing a loved one? What did you decide? And do you have a question about autopsy? Dr. Gregory J. Davis and Dr. Stephen J. Cina answer readersâ questions about autopsy on the Consults blog, “Should You Have an Autopsy Done?” Comments are no longer being accepted. The subject of autopsy is usually brought up when the cause of death is in question. Do you or do you not want the truth for your present and future family members? The most useful consequence of knowing is for family members to be aware that they may have a propensity to contract the disease that killed the family member. Would I be able to choose autopsy the same way I can choose DNR? Would my family be able to interefere post-mortem? My thinking is perhaps I could spare them a difficult decision. Most families currently refuse autopsies.  I think this is partially because of the timing of the request and partially because of a change in our culture.  Autopsies used to provide an important source of advancement of medical knowledge and learning for doctors.  How difficult it is to ask and be asked for an autopsy just after your loved one has died!  The images of a pathologist slicing through your loved one’s body is often to awful for families to digest.  I agree with the article’s author that closure can often be obtained by the family simply talking with the physician but that this also frequently doesn’t happen.  Families might be surprised to learn how often doctors want closure as much as they do–what did the doctor miss?  What was the real cause of death?  Should the doctor have figured it out before the patient died?  Sometimes the answer is yes, sometimes no, but doctors always want to know so they can do better next time. //happinessinthisworld.com When my husband passed away four years ago, the death was sudden and he had shown no obvious signs of illness.  I say “no obvious signs,” because when I began the long reflection that comes with grief, I was overwhelmed with perceived signs.  When looking back at photos, I notice that his color was not good.  Then I remembered that his hair was brittle.  He would get bouts of tiredness that were rare, but would really put him in bed for a day at most.  He was only 46 years old.  He died in an emergency.  Due to his age and the suddeness of his death, an autopsy was required by the county medical examiner.  I am so thankful that the autopsy was performed by a third party.  Their findings gave me peace.  My husband was an outwardly healthy man with more stamina than me.  Yet, they detected a problem with his heart.  It was a dilated cardiomyopathy.  I had never heard of it before.  It could have been hereditary or it might have been caused by a virus, but it was not my fault that I had not noticed signs.  It is difficult to see illness evolve when one lives with someone daily.  Autopsies are not a violation of the dead.  They provided important answers that can help with the grieving process. About 10 years ago our 5 day old baby died for obvious reasons. He was born a micro premie, months before his due date.
My husband and I decided we wanted an autopsy performed. Why?
We thought that kind of research was very important for the future of the premature births to come in the following years. And we had no religious reasons to hold us back on that decision.
The autopsy was done, we got the results we already knew and I was pregnant again very soon.
Our now 8 year old son was born extremely premature at just over 2 pounds. He is as healthy as can be.
I do not know if agreeing to an autopsy will necessarily help the mourning pain. Our pain was healed by time passing. However, I strongly recommend it as it might save lives in the future and in my eyes is a great contribution to our society and medical research. Yvonne F. Jersey City What would give me pause would be the terribly invasive nature of the autopsy, the internal mutilation of the organs. Is it worth it ? In the case of a gross medical error, probably. Otherwise, probably not. When a person is gone, they’re gone. Let go of the reason and move on to remembering the person who died. Â¿ can you imagine a country where main analysis from official autopsy could be issued a year later  ?  ThatÂ´s my CHILE, just in south corner of our planet. astonished,  Oscar Ardiles
Chile There should be AMA approved guidelines on autopsy.  My dad’s doctor asked me for pemission to make an incision to examine the heart because he was unsure of what he had seen from other measurements. I figured my dad would be flattered by the attention to a ticker that finally failed after 90 years. When my son died suddenly, we had no option but to have an autopsy. While it provided some comfort that his death was not our fault but the diagnosis of last resort: SIDS, I remain ambivalent about the process being performed on a loved one. For the burial clothing, we were instructed to provide a hat, and I struggled with the knowledge that it was to cover a skull that had been opened up.  Since I read the report when I received it about 6 weeks after his death, I have not wanted to look at it, the minute details of every organ’s unremarkable appearance and weight.  Were I in doubt of a loved one’s cause of death, I would still reluctantly request an autopsy, still not want to think about the procedure much. My husband died unexpectedly of a heart attach when he was 48.  He had had no obvious symptoms, that is, he didn’t have the classic symptoms of a heart attack.  The state wanted to do a autopsy because of his age and lack of symptoms.  Since it was an unexpected death and I hadn’t had any other close relatives die, I wouldn’t have thought about asking for an autopsy.  But I was very glad they did it.  Otherwise I would have always wondered exactly why he died and if I had missed something obvious.  My only regret was that because of doing an autopsy, I couldn’t even donate his skin or lens to others.  Thanks for talking about this. Thanks for posting this, and for recommending autopsies.  Family members can also gain important genetic knowledge through an autopsy. My family had many unanswered questions regarding the actual diseases which caused the deaths of  my mom & my mother-in-law.   An autopsy would have anwered a lot of questions with respect to how their diseases were treated & if they were inheritable–and those answers would have provided treatment guidance in the future should either of these recur in other family members.   Even friends could have benefitted from what we might have found out.. None of our questions had a thing to do with malpractice–we just had questions. But, frankly, before reading Grady’s eye opening article, we assumed that  our questions wouldn’t be “autopsy-worthy”.  One just doesn’t autopsy an elderly person. When faced with the death of a relative it feels just easier to not question.  To rationalize, “It doesn’t change anything. Why put our loved one through the “indignity.  To what end?” Thanks for this enlightening piece. //www.happyhealthylonglife.com/ When my mother died at 96, an autopsy was requested by the doctor in an attempt to find where internal bleeding had occurred, as an earlier operation was unsuccessful. I, a son, approved, but an older sister said no. In this state (Minn.) the oldest child has precedence and her refusal ended it. My father-in-law died at age 82 from a host of ailments. He was old, he was failing, he developed (maybe) Parkinsons, he just got increasingly frail and unresponsive and died one night in his sleep. We, the children, accepted this as an inevitable end to a lengthy and generally healthy life. My mother-in-law, now 7 years later, is still asking herself if she should have requested an autopsy. She really wants to know just what exactly he died of. The death certificate says heart failure, which seems obvious. If we had to do it over again, I think we would support an autopsy. If only to give my mother-in-law the peace of mind of knowing what exactly he died of in the end. It is absolutely untrue that pathologists will not cover up for their colleagues’ malpractice. If you want an autopsy, you should get one at an institution unrelated to the one where the patient died or has ever been treated.  This can be hard outside a major city. Pathologists frequently use the clinical chart as a guide to the clinical facts (which may not be true) and parrot the treating physician’s conclusions as their own. An autopsy is the most complete medical examination a patient can receive.  Its purpose is much more than just finding out the cause of death.  It also extends to medical research, genetic counseling, teaching of young physicians, and yes, closure.  All important topics and contributions derived from this most serious medical procedure.   The last 500 years of scientific medicine are essentially based on knowledge derived from autopsies, after Antonio Benivieni started recording his observations on autopsies.  A commons misconception is that because our current medical knowledge and technology are so advanced, autopsies add little to what is already known by the time of death.  But in all studies addressing this issue, the results indicate that there is a significant amount of new information obtained after an autopsy is performed, and in many cases, diagnoses made at autopsy could have changed the clinical approach if that information could have been available. My first surprise with the piece published by Denis Grady, is that the person requesting the autopsy to the family was a nurse (!).  Many physicians ignore the full value, technical details and other characteristics of an autopsy, and few have witnessed an autopsy during their years of training.  Nurses are qualified for very important medical-related functions, but are not the appropriate professional to request an autopsy.  Only an experienced physician that has established significant rapport with the family of the deceased is qualified to request the autopsy, and only with full knowledge of the case, details of the procedure and enough sensibility to address such delicate and emotionally charged issue.  Occasionally, a pathologist can also be present when an autopsy is requested to the family in order to help explaining all the necessary details. I applaud the comment posted earlier by Mrs. Yvonne Fricker. Miguel Reyes-MÃºgica, M.D.

Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC “What would give me pause would be the terribly invasive nature of the autopsy, the internal mutilation of the organs.” – Unsure About It #6 Um, as opposed to what happens to the body after you put it in the ground? or during cremation? Unless your loved one is Lenin, he’s not going to lie in perfect eternal repose (and I understand even Vlad is looking a little shopworn now). Iirrational as it is, I do understand the feeling completely – the inability to grasp that your loved one is no longer in there. It – yes, “it,” not “he/she” – is an empty shell. Granted, many religious traditions shun any kind of mutilation of the body. For instance, highly observant Jews will agree (in extremely unusual circumstances only) to allow the blood to be replaced with preservative only if the blood is kept to be buried with the body. Until recently the Roman Catholic Church was against cremation. If you had a national / federal health service free at the point of supply many of the social / societal / cultural issues would be more fully addressed. Whereas now BILLING is the hospital and doctors’ main interest. Oh and LIABILITY. One reason autopsies don’t happen is because of the expense. If the law doesn’t require an autopsy and the family wants one, it must be done privately. Insurance does not cover this.  The lack of autopsies generated by hospitals is depressing. The fear of lawsuits and the expense of doing the procedure gives the hospitals little incentive to furthur examine cause of death. It out wieghs the information and learning that used to be accomplished. #10, if there is a proper system in place then donations can often be made, depending on the pathologists needs. Eyes, skin, bones especially. If you get Discovery Health on cable you can watch the “Dr. G” program. She is a coroner in Florida. They don’t show the really gross parts and it’s interesting to follow her through her process. I can understand the desire for answers but the person is no longer alive.  An autopsy will not revive. As interns and residents, we are enjoined to “get the autopsy” or at least document that we asked. I can count on one hand the number of times over the course of my training years that a family said yes. However, many years and grey hairs later, I can say that it is largely in how the question is asked. If it is offered as a way to confirm diagnoses, obtain reassurance and provide closure, the answer is more likely to be yes. And, you can indicate whether you want an autopsy for yourself on your advance directive, though your family would still need to give permission.   If there is a specific question about the diagnosis that needs to be addressed, I try to be honest about that too. Sometimes we can do a limited autopsy (tissue biopsy, limited incisions and so on) to address a particular issue. Unfortunately, unlike CSI, the truth is that sometimes the questions remain unanswered, even after autopsy. My son, age 35, died unexpectedly in March.  His body necessarily was autopsied, since he died in his apartment with no witnesses to his death.  I resisted even requesting a report until my daughter told me how important it was to her that she know the results of the autopsy.  So I did request the report, and my sister who is a nurse read through it with us and explained the results.   I’m grateful now that I did request the report.  Learning that my son was healthy and “well nourished” in spite of chronic alcoholism, complications of which were the cause of his death, gives me comfort.  I feel assured that he probably felt no physical pain in the last days and hours of his life and that he slept quietly into death. Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
