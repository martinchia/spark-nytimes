 To the Editor: Re “Tapping Into What a Deer Sees, and Doesn’t” (Findings, Sept. 23): John Tierney muses that if male hunters believe there is an inherent “chick magnet” factor to their traditional camouflage gear, there may  be “lots of shrubs and trees toting guns and bows during hunting season.”  I am a recent graduate of a hunter-safety course where we learned that during gun season here, hunters must wear clothing that is at least 50 percent blaze orange. So if anyone sees a shrub armed with a rifle or a shotgun in the woods in Wisconsin, alert your game warden! Karen BasslerMadison, Wis. Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
