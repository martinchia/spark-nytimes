 The Vital Statistics column on Oct. 13, about a new state-by-state breakdown of diabetes cases among Americans 30 and over, referred incompletely to the findings, which were published in the online journal BioMed Central. The analysis covered all diabetes cases; it did not distinguish between Types 1 and 2. (About 95 percent of diabetes cases in those 30 and over are Type 2.) A version of this correction appears in print on October 24, 2009, on Page A2 of the New York edition with the headline: Corrections.  Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe
