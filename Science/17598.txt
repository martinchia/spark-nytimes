 Q. Why are there more moths than ever before in my Manhattan apartment this season? A. Moth populations can very from day to day, season to season and year to year, said Christine A. Johnson, a behavioral ecologist in the department of entomology at the American Museum of Natural History, “in part because you are not always seeing the same species of moth and in part because of the ecology of the moth.” The outdoor population is affected by temperature and rainfall, Dr. Johnson said. “When the temperature is warm and there is the appropriate amount of rainfall, caterpillars thrive,” she said, especially vegetable garden pests. Too much sun and no rain, or too much rain and no sun may make the numbers plunge. Large numbers one year can crash the next year because of winter conditions, competition and predators. Indoors, a moth population explosion might have to do with what you are storing and how, Dr. Johnson suggested. Moths do not emerge all at the same time, she said, so it might take a while to find the source and get rid of them. She traced a big infestation of meal moths in the family Pyralidae in Columbus, Ohio, to a large supply of birdseed in a closet. “All I needed was a couple of females laying their eggs in the seed, and I had hundreds of moths swarming my apartment,” she said.
