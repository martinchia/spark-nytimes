 To the Editor: Re “When It Comes to Sex, Chimps Need Help, Too” (Findings, May 4): I found it devastating to learn that chimpanzees, too, use sex toys. I had placed so much stock in belonging to the only species that could think up something as brilliant as ripping a leaf to attract a sexual partner. I am confident, however, that humanity will forever remain unique in one aspect: we are the only species that constantly works to discredit our own species’ uniqueness.
