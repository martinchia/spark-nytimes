Mark Siddall, the curator of the division of invertebrate biology at the American Museum of Natural History, has spent most of his career studying leeches and the chemicals they use to block the coagulation of blood from their prey. It is, he discovered, a deftly targeted toxicity.  âActually, leeches are very good at sucking out blood without any help,â he told me. âThe real issue is that they may consume eight times their body weight of blood in a single feeding. And what they donât want is for the blood to clot inside them.â  The leeches got him thinking about the often unexpected ways that animals use poisons. The result is a new book, âPoison: Sinister Species With Deadly Consequences,â which abounds with stories of lethal encounters, often involving scientists — interspersed with creepy drawings, by Megan Gavin, of animals crawling across the pages.  “Poisonous compounds are like yin and yang, dark and light,â Dr. Siddall said. âThey’re often medicinal on the one hand, lethal on the other. That something is poisonous doesnât make it bad; itâs what we do with it.” I spoke with him about the toxic natures of snakes and spiders, frogs and fish, bees and even birds. Our conversation  has been condensed and edited.   Was there a particular incident that inspired you to write the book?  I dedicated the book to my friend Joe Slowinsky, who died of snakebite in Burma. And it was his story that really got me started on the book. In 2001, Joe was a snake biologist who had recently become a curator for the California Academy of Sciences. He was trying to look at biodiversity of snakes in Burma. He reached into a bag to remove a small snake heâd collected, and it bit him.  It was only after that he realized it was a juvenile banded krait.   Couldnât he be saved with antivenin?  They did keep him alive for several days, but they couldnât get him out of the wild in time.  Itâs tragic, but itâs also not entirely surprising. Joe was a snake biologist, and he handled snakes. People tend to be afraid of snakes on sight, but the fact is the vast majority of people killed by snakes are people who are handling them. Unfortunately, that includes innumerable scientists.   There was the one researcher in Honduras in the 1920s who was bitten a number of times before he died, as I remember.  Douglas March. He was working for the United Fruit Company (now Dole), and they had a problem with snakes in the banana plantations. So he set up two serpentariums so that they could house snakes and use their venom to make antivenin.   As I say in the book, he was bitten more than a dozen times and survived those bites, so maybe he got a little too confident. Then he was bitten by a yellow beard snake. And that is a very dangerous snake. It uses a very complex cocktail of venoms that contain enzymes that liquefy tissue. Then the venom is spread to other muscles as the blood vessels are also destroyed. There are compounds in the venom that prevent clotting, so you get not only tissue liquefaction but massive blood loss.   Doesnât that seem kind of over the top?   Well, one theory is that the more complicated you make your cocktail of venoms, greater probability that the attack will succeed. And we know that many of these venoms are designed for defense and increased in response to threat.  For instance,  the rough-skinned newt, which lives in Oregon, has high levels of tetrodotoxin, a powerful neurotoxic compound, in its skin.  It turns out that the newts are preyed on by garter snakes that have responded by evolving resistance to the original amounts of poison.  The newts have responded again by increasing the levels of the toxin in their skin. We might think of it as over the top, but thereâs usually a very good reason.  Are these newts dangerous to people?  I tell a story in the book of a young Oregon man who went out drinking with his friends and after a number of rounds, they dared him to swallow his pet newt. He did, and he died of cardiac arrest. And that tells us that thereâs enough tetrodotoxin in a single rough skinned newt to kill a grown man.  Then itâs helpful if you know something about natural poisons.  Weâre more afraid of what we donât know than what we do. So this kind of knowledge can help you figure out when to be careful.
For instance, the big scorpion scene in the movie âWar, Inc.â uses an emperor scorpion with enormous pincers, which really doesnât make any sense. Scorpions that have big pincers to defend themselves arenât very venomous because they donât need to be. But thereâs a lot we donât know. Do you remember when the âcrocodile hunter,â Steve Irwin, died after he got too close to a stingray and the barb went into his heart? When I started doing some research, I discovered that he wasnât the only person to take a stingray strike to the chest. Most didnât survive, and thatâs not surprising because stingrays also have a venom that liquefies flesh.  But I have been wondering, do they also have the ability to aim?  Iâm struck by the risk-taking behavior of scientists in your book in studying these compounds.   Some of it is risk-taking, and some can be credited to the principle that itâs easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. You canât be fired for having done it to yourself.  Chuck Myers, who used to be a curator here, developed a rather effective assay in the 1970s, which was to touch his tongue to the back of a frog.  He was studying poison frogs in Latin America. When his tongue went numb, he knew heâd found something.  I donât see that so much as risk-taking. I see it as evidence of the deep and uncontrollable thirst for knowledge that natural history scientists have. So you pick up the snake. You let the black widow bite into your hand. And you start working on the answers.  It strikes me that the story of poisons is also a story of evolution.  Poisons are part of a living experiment happening in these incredible biological reactors that we call animals and plants. As much as I think we should be retaining biodiversity for aesthetic regions, if we look at it from a human health viewpoint, then this is chemistry we really want to preserve. These are exquisitely adapted systems. We donât want to lose them.  Your health questions answered by Times journalists and experts.
