 High blood pressure is the leading preventable cause of death in China, causing 2.3 million deaths a year, researchers reported on Monday. Their paper, released online by The Lancet, was done by scientists at Tulane University, the National Center for Cardiovascular Disease in Beijing and other institutions. It was based on a study of nearly 170,000 Chinese ages 40 or over who were first gathered in 1991 for medical exams that included blood pressure tests. About 1.3 million of the deaths  occurred in men under age 72 or women under 75, the average life expectancies in China in 2005. Most were caused by strokes and aneurysms, followed by heart attacks. The study was financed by the American Heart Association, the National Institutes of Health and China’s Ministries of Health and Science and Technology. Dietary sodium is very high in China because “people add a lot of salt in cooking,” said Dr. Jiang He, the study’s lead author. While high blood pressure is common in both China and the United States, far fewer Chinese are tested or treated. In an accompanying editorial, researchers from Australia and China complained that the international health community “remains easily distracted by exotic microbes, such as swine and avian influenza, and seems to find focusing on things as mundane as raised blood pressure difficult, despite the catastrophic human and financial consequences.” A version of this article appears in print on October 6, 2009, on Page D6 of the National edition with the headline: China: High Blood Pressure Tops the List Of Preventable Deaths in China.
