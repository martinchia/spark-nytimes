Personal technology for health and fitness. A tablet can be the perfect gateway gadget when it comes to connecting an aging mom, dad or tech-reluctant grandparent with the rest of the wired world. Small, light and simple, a tablet requires less technical skill and manual dexterity than, say, a laptop or a smartphone. If, that is, an older adult can figure out how to turn it on. That is what my 70-year-old mom was trying to do with the AARP RealPad. I asked her to help me evaluate the $149 tablet as the potential starting point to modern technology for someone born long before the Internet was a twinkle in Al Goreâs eye. My mom is not Internet-illiterate by any means. She is already a tablet-toting senior who not only owns an iPad, but knows how to use it. She plays a wicked game of Words With Friends and posts photos on Facebook (not always a good thing), and has even been known to binge-watch a season of âDownton Abbeyâ or two. But this relatively inexpensive, made-for-seniors slate had her stumped. The RealPadâs pitch is: âNo confusion and no frustration.â But out of the box there seems to be plenty of both. For starters, the on button on the side of the 7.85-inch Android tablet is tiny â about half the size of the one on the iPad Air. The circle with a half line through it, the symbol for the on button, is the size of the head on a pushpin. The button icon is a shade of gray stamped on silver, so it is really hard to see, and you have to hold the on button down for several seconds before it responds. These small but annoying obstacles quickly became a theme throughout my Momâs experience with the RealPad, which is basically a generic Android tablet dressed up in a sort of senior-friendly skin. On the plus side, it does come with extra large icons on the home screen, and a button bar that you swipe up from the bottom for easy access to video tutorials, troubleshooting tools and 24/7 phone support. My mom appreciates the AARP connection, and so does my 76-year-old neighbor, Bill Young, another gracious gadget-testing guinea pig I asked to check out the RealPad. Unlike my mom, Mr. Young has kept the wired world at bay a little longer. He only recently bought a cellphone. The flip kind. For emergencies only. The RealPad looked tiny in his large hands, and his first gripe was that it was just too small. He wanted it to be easier to hold and see, and wondered why the buttons werenât bigger. He thought his elder friends with arthritis or hand tremors would have a hard time with it, too. He asked if it came in a color besides black. It doesnât. Mr. Young got the RealPad to turn on right away, but doing anything else useful took a few trying days. âCurrently, I am stuck on camera mode, and even turning the device on and off does not help!â he wrote in an email from his computer. I told him to tap the back arrow on the bottom of the screen. âThere isnât one,â he wrote. Try tapping the screen, I typed back, hoping an icon of some sort would pop up. âOh, I see,â he responded. If you havenât encountered the Android operating system, or much technology at all, every push, tap, swipe and touch seems like a foreign language. Like my mom, Mr. Young owns an iPad. He bought a book to learn to use it. It took Mr. Young two days to get the RealPad connected to his home Wi-Fi, with plenty of trial and error along the way. He and I exchanged a few more emails, and I suggested he try one of the help buttons on the home screen. That eventually did the trick, once he found a video titled âConnecting to My Wi-Fi.â âReal Help appears to be a real asset,â he emailed me a short time later. âI only wish the voice quality on the videos was better, but what can you expect for $150?â Good point. Except that for a gadget aimed at bringing the generation that technology forgot into the fold, it is not good enough. âWeâve lost some of our eyesight; weâve lost some of our manual dexterity; but mostly weâve lost the patience to deal with stuff that doesnât work right,â said Gary Kaye, the founder of Tech50+, a review site with an eye for smart senior gadgets. He said older adults are long overdue for an entry-level gadget to help them live more active and independent lives. With roughly 76 million baby boomers turning 65 by 2030, technology is desperate for a senior-friendly shift, but the RealPad isnât it. At least not yet. Ironically, budget tablets that are not being marketed to older adults seem better suited for them than the RealPad. The $179 Kindle Fire HDX, for example, features a Mayday button that brings a live helper to the screen should any issues arise. I wish the RealPad offered that type of support, in addition to the extra-large icons, 800 number and how-to videos. Kristin S. Palmer, AARPâs spokeswoman, said the organization was working on a next-generation device that addresses many of these issues, but there is no word on timing yet. She also said AARPâs goal with the RealPad was to âshake up the marketâ and get other companies thinking about the 50-plus audience. To that end, one can argue that the RealPad has been a success. But you may still have to help your parent turn it on. Related: For more fitness, food and wellness news, “like” our Facebook page.
