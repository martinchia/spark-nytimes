 Q. Does deep-freezing fish kill harmful parasites?  A. It can if the food gets cold enough and stays that way long enough, according to guidelines for the food industry from the Food and Drug Administration. For disease-causing parasites like tapeworms, roundworms and flukes, which may infest raw or undercooked fish, freezing can be the answer, but its effectiveness varies. It works best for tapeworms and appears to be somewhat less effective for roundworms and flukes. In general, killing parasites requires freezing and storing fish at a surrounding temperature of minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit or colder for seven days; or freezing at a surrounding temperature of minus 31 degrees or colder until the fish is solid and storing at the same temperature for 15 hours; or freezing at a surrounding temperature of minus 31 degrees until the fish is solid and storing at minus 4 degrees or below for 24 hours. Not all home refrigerator freezers get cold enough. To be sure that your freezer will work for controlling parasites, do not rely on the thermostat, but use a good freezer thermometer. The F.D.A. also warns that these techniques may not be suitable for particularly large fish, like those thicker than six inches. While freezing does not kill most bacteria, it does stop their growth; then sufficient cooking can reduce or eliminate bacterial risks. question@nytimes.com Questions of general interest will be answered, but requests for medical advice cannot be honored and unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
