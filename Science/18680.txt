It was a slow day on the floor and my patient, whose hair was falling out from chemo, had just asked me to shave his head.  âSure,â I said, even though, despite the two years plus Iâve spent in oncology nursing, I had yet to shave anyoneâs head. Some cancer patients find the process of waiting for their hair to fall out intolerable. Loose hairs fall into their eyes when theyâre awake and tickle their faces while they sleep. During showers they feel awash in hair. At some point all the loose strands start to drive them crazy, and thatâs when patients ask the nurse for a shave. Patients worry a lot about losing their hair, but we nurses donât think about baldness much. Weâre so used to our hairless patients that we accept it as normal. Cancer drugs target quickly dividing cells, and that includes the cells in hair follicles. Patients tend to lose their hair 10 to 14 days after the start of chemo. It can take several weeks for it to grow back, but by that time theyâre probably getting more chemo, so they end up being bald for a long time. The patient today was a big guy, not overweight, just solid, in his mid-50s, with a boyish smile and a sly sarcastic streak that made me laugh. My friend Christi said she had shaved plenty of heads and offered instruction as well as moral support. Shaving this patientâs head was probably as good as it gets for a first time. His wife insisted on taking pictures and tried to get me to leave him with a mohawk.  Afterward his wife asked if we could rustle up a hat for him, but really he didnât need one â being bald suited him. Once Iâd shaved his head and saw how he looked, the whole idea of hair seemed superfluous. I shared with him this arch comment from Liz Tilberis, the former editor of British Vogue, who died at 51 of ovarian cancer: âOnce youâve had chemotherapy,” she had said, “thereâs no such thing as a bad hair day.â The next day, though, a different patient — this time a woman — asked me to get out the electric razor. She reminded me a bit of myself. She was roughly my age, 44, and had an 11-year-old daughter, whereas my twin daughters are 10. Her hair was already fairly short, cut into an almost-shoulder-length bob. When the doctors had come in for morning rounds she had stood up and then, looking embarrassed, brushed off the layer of hair that had fallen out and covered her shoulders and back. She had been losing so much hair, she said, she felt like she was shedding.  That evening I got ready to shave my second head in two days, but the atmosphere in the room this time was completely different. Night had fallen outside, and my patientâs room, lit with fluorescent lights, held a lonely glow. Her husband had been with her during the day, but now she was alone. I picked up a new blade for the clippers and grabbed a clean sheet to wrap around her like a barberâs cape. Before I started I asked if she wanted me to cut her hair short first before shaving it, but she said no, to just shave her head.  She was sitting in a chair facing one of the large windows in her room. Partway through she noticed a ghostly reflection of her half-shorn head in the window glass. âOh my god,â she gasped. And suddenly I felt very awkward, even guilty, about what I was doing. I realized for the first time how difficult it can be to lose your hair as a byproduct of saving your own life. But this woman, my patient, had asked me to shave her head, and so I did.  She didnât say much â she was one of the more quiet patients I’ve encountered. But as her hair came off she revealed a few things. Her biggest worry was what her daughter would say. And she hadnât told her husband that her head would be bald on his return. When we were done, she headed to the shower to wash away all the small pieces of hair that were clinging to her. Meeting back in her room, I said, gently, âWell, youâre not crying.â âNo,â she said, âbut that may come later.â Comments are no longer being accepted. I had chemo last year and loved being bald.  My son and I went together to have our heads shaved and our local paper made a video of it.  We both had fairly long hair and I had a hairpiece made out of our hair.   If people didn’t react so boldly to bald women I’d be bald the rest of my life. Sometimes it was comical, perfect strangers coming up to ask me if I had breast cancer and who was my doctor.  And sometimes heartbreaking, once a mother brought her tiny 8 year old son over to me and asked me to tell him that  he was going to be OK after his 3rd round of chemo.  That he was scared and if the bald lady with cancer told him it would be OK then he wouldn’t be so afraid. I felt like a department store Santa, granting wishes I couldn’t hope to provide. I’m a little surprised you agreed to shave his head. If you had nicked his skin, wouldn’t that have put you or your hospital under some liability for possible infection? That being said: My partner, who later died from breast cancer, went for the bald look after her hair reached the wispy state, and she wore a cap only on the coldest days. I think she decided to take advantage of one of the few freedoms left to her, freedom from primping according to the tastes and demands of society. What you did was a wonderful service for those patients. I lost my hair twice due to different treatment regimens and each time there were emotions associated that I did not expect.  The one thing you should know is that sometimes the hair falling out can make the scalp quite tender so don’t be surprised if one of your salon clients mentions it. It is not the effect of your barbering but of thier heads.  Kate @ //www.aftercancernowwhat.com I remember when my dad had cancer and started to lose his hair.  At first, as a business man, he was definitely self conscious.  But as he lost more weight, and more hair, he finally came to terms with the fact that cancer isn’t easy, and the physical aspect of losing hair was nothing compared to the emotional difficulties and the fear of death that comes with the onset of cancer.  I think  cancer makes you appreciate your life a lot more, and by the end, what you look like goes out the window, and how you feel becomes much, much more important.  This is at least the transformation my dad went through, and it was definitely eye opening for me and the way I looked at my own life. //foodfitnessfreshair.wordpress.com/ Just a note to let you know that I can no longer read your column.  You are just sooooooooooooooo depressing all of the time.  Not everything about cancer is so bleak. Thanks for this post. It brought back memories of shaving my wife’s head earlier this year. She had breast cancer and chemo and the inevitable hair loss that accompanies. I would recommend that you council your patients on the following:
– Hair loss isn’t just limited to hair on their head – it’s their whole body. My wife felt very vulnerable during this period. Rest assured though – it will grow back!
– Parents with school aged children should talk to their kids and set expectations with them. Our kids were fine with their Mom being bald AT HOME, but when she was at school they requested that she wear a wig so she would look normal.
– New hair growth can come in fits and starts and sometimes the first batch doesn’t stick. That said, when my wife’s new hair came in, she decided that she really liked keeping it short – and she looks great!
Thanks for doing what you do – it means a lot.
– David My father-in-law, a barber, shaved my head when I was undergoing chemo for breast cancer. The only two times I’ve ever seen him cry were when we visited the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, DC, and the day he shaved my head. I was so relieved to have him do it, rather than a stranger, that I hadn’t even considered what an emotional undertaking it would be for him. It was one of many meaningful moments I’ve shared with him. I am lucky as can be to have such an incredible father-in-law. This is sad. If found guilty of cancer the patient is treated like those hapless victims of the Auto da Fe painting of Spanish art.  Good by, hair, hello shaved head. Bless those nurses and others who help to ease this traumatic event. Cancer treatment professionals need to put their heads together and try to let each other and their patients know what works best with the least damage. It’s forty years down the road from mid century cancer treatments and still it’s massive doses of chemicals. There must be master oncologists who can balance doses that do the least damage but result in successful treatment. Yesterday there was a column on making the health insurance plan work by using a system the USDA field offices did to improve farming practices. Perhaps one of the cancer research groups could apply the same “field agent” system to discover and disseminate the best cancer treatments to the greatest number of health care workers. They also research who ask the pros and pass on the best information. I bet there are nurses out there who know tricks of the trade such as the best time of day for treatment. Is it morning? Then perform the drips only  then. Only afternoon? Ditto. Don’t waste time, money, and lives if time is of the essence of the treatment. I know this column is about shaving a patient’s head, but the name of the elephant in the room is Cancer. Hair loss for a woman is very emotional, even devistating, especially if it will never grow back.  I suffer from alopecia universalis.  I’ve had it for about 8-10 years and it started in my adult years.  It leaves me very self conscious in intimate moments with men because I don’t want my “secret” revealed.  On top of no hair on the head, there are no eye lashes, no eyebrows, etc.
Chemo patients get financial support for wigs required during chemo.  I receive nothing so it costs me at least $2,000 per year for human hair wigs.  This is a disease that doesn’t kill you physically but takes a real emotional toll causing great insecurity.  It can have a permanent effect on your social outlook and ultimately your life.
Of course no one wants to champion this problem before any legislature. Deciding when to lose your hair is one of the only things that chemo patients can exercize control over.  When my wife started chemo we had a drawing at her office.  Everyone contributed a dollar amount and got a number.  The person whose number was drawn got to shave her head.  The proceeds went toward cancer research. After becoming bald as a result of chemo, I toyed with the idea of wearing a wig – it seemed expected and I was even supplied a wig “allowance” by my insurance provider.  So I figured, “It’s free – might as well”.  None of the wigs looked right on me and I ended up going without, which was very freeing.  I am jealous of the men who can choose to be bald and not stand out as strange in our society.  To be rid of all that messy hair that is always in the way!  My mom, who is bald for a non-cancer reason confided that she wished she had the nerve to go wigless at times, but couldn’t for “generational issues”.  For the most part, no one treated me differently.  I met several cancer survivors that way, as it was a badge of honor instantly recognizable at the grocery store, or out on the street.  One time in a road rage incident, the other driver yelled at me “You think you’re so cool because you are bald!!!”.   When my hair grew back, so many people made comments about the color and the curly texture (it had been and is now again straight). What is it about  hair or lack thereof that is so important to us?  My oncologist simply explained that if I didn’t lose my hair, that would mean that the treatment wasn’t working.  Made me feel better about the temporary hair loss. My mom let her hair fall out as she went through chemo and finally asked a good family friend, who happened to be a retired hairdresser, to cut some of it off. When he came over and started snipping, she just ended up asking him to shave it all off and let me tell you, she had a gorgeous bald head! A few dozen hats later and my mom is in remission and is now rocking a beautiful short cut. She looks fabulous! But I will always know the beautiful bald head hiding under all that hair. I had a “scare” earlier this year and was expecting to go for chemo or some other treatment.  Like Bobbi 109 wrote:  hair is one of the only things I felt that I could control.  I set about making a plan and delayed getting my very long hair cut until after I got the all-clear.  The hair was more than long enough to be donated and that is what I ultimately did, even though I didn’t have to have any treatments. When we told my then five year old that I would be losing my hair, he had two requests. First, he didn’t want his friends to know that his mommy was sick, so I had to wear a wig around them. Second, I could wear a cap or scarf at home, but he didn’t want to see me bald. A few years later, he told me that he was worried that he would laugh if he saw my bald head. I was 13 when I was diagnosed with leukemia. THis was 1982. As a 13 year old boy, the thought of losing my hair was brutal. The thought of being different was hard to handle. As silly as it sounds now, after the countless bone marrow tests, spinal taps and chemo, the thing that bothered me the most during those 2 years was not having my hair.
  I didn’t have to make the choice to shave it off. The drugs were so strong that it all fell out almost immediately. To Aging Boomer from a surgeon:
It is almost impossible to get a scalp infection because the blood supply to the scalp is so good.  As long as patients don’t have issues with bleeding, shaving the head is not a problem.  Besides, the best health care professionals are not guided by liability – they are guided by what is best for the patient. >”Not everything about cancer is so bleak.” After having my wife go through (and beat) breast cancer and now her mother going through chemo for metastasized cancer, I have to say you have an odd viewpoint of a killer disease. If this column is too depressing for you, don’t read it. I am surprised at how traumatic this is for some men. I certainly do understand  for women, but as a guy who shaves his head every day and hangs around others, and even the occasional woman with a shaved head, it would be no big deal for me. Bald heads are now very accepted among men. Not so women though, I agree. We should feel lucky we don’t have to have the ultimate haircut, and appreciate our good health.
Amen. I had always joked that the only hair length I hadn’t tried was a shaved head so when I got my diagnosis for a non-Hodgkins Lymphoma I shaved it (my head that is) myself soon after choosing an intravenous treatment.  It allowed me to pose as just a bald headed guy by choice in hopes that I could avoid undue concern (I work in a restaurant).  As it turned out I had not the wit to reaize that my mouse protein treatments do not cause hair loss (nor gain) and it is impossible to keep secrets when so many people live at the periphery of your life.  But I liked it and even though it is winter here in the mid-west (again) I am keeping it buzzed for for a while. I think women tend to care a bit more about their hair than men.  As a feminist, I can’t believe I’ve just made a sexist remark!   Early in 2008, when I started chemo for the second time, my grandsons got out the clippers we use for the horses, and they took turns buzzing off my hair.  Then they buzzed each other, and we took a couple of photos of the three of us with no hair.  Their support, love and laughter made this a bonding experience for me.  I had eight rounds of chemo in 2008, and then five very intense days of chemo just before Christmas 2008, to get a stem cell transplant on Dec. 24.   My hair is finally starting to grow back.  I still struggle with how to style it, and frequently say, “The heck with it,” and wear a hat.  It is liberating not to fuss with one’s appearance.  But it took nerve to go out in public bald.  I had two wigs, one that looked nice, which I wore exactly one time.  The second wig was platinum LIME green, and I wore it as an ‘up yours’ gesture to having cancer invade my life for a second time. Dear Theresa Brown, So many of us have family and friends who have or had cancer.  And anyone with cancer faces death a lot sooner than they expected.  Going bald, being shaved, must be a way of facing that understanding full on.  Even if the final result is a cure, this must be very difficult. It is not easy to write an article like this, without either being maudlin or detached.  You, by contrast, showed compassion and respect for your patients, and acknowledgment of what they are going through.  Thank you for the thoughtful and truthful article. Tandy During chemo your scalp becomes very vulnerable to infection.  I chose to cut my hair very short before the treatments began and to let it fall out naturally, which it did quite rapidly.  Despite this, I developed a nasty case of  folliculitis.  So not only was I bald, but my head was covered with what looked like a very bad case of acne.  My docs told me to keep it uncovered as the sweat from a scarf, hat  or wig would irritate the infected scalp.  Antibiotics helped, but the condition continued until I was able to stop the chemo.  Even so, this was the least troublesome for me of the many side effects of chemo and radiation.  I am hopeful that  the researchers will continue to develop increasingly less devastating cancer treatments for the many people  who  have this deadly disease. Sad. And a beautiful piece of writing. Thank you for writing this beautiful piece. During the Christmas holiday last year, my mom decided to shave what was left of her hair instead of waiting for chemo to slowly finish the job. It wasn’t a big deal to me because I thought it’d make life easier for her. But it was such a hard decision for her. I wasn’t at the hairdresser when she did it but I know she did cry. But wouldn’t you know, when she came home and took of her hat, I was surprised by my reaction. My mom was so beautiful! She didn’t believe us when we said it, but having a clean-shaven head highlighted her good looks. We went on and on about it, but I think that kind of made her dwell on the loss more. Eventually she came around though and a few months later called to proudly say that she had gone to work, without her wig, for the first time! So,it’s true, not everyone will respond to shaving their head the same way. But regardless, they need the love, care and sometimes, silent understanding, of the people around them.
