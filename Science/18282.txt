 To the Editor: Re “In 2008, a 100 Percent Chance of Alarm” (Findings, Jan. 1): John Tierney criticizes climate change activists for being unbalanced reporters of the scientific evidence on global warming. If democracies were known to respond wisely to distant, intangible threats, his call for a more nuanced activism would be warranted. What makes global warming such a challenge is precisely the fact that political action is required decades before the effects will be unequivocally disastrous. Should we not therefore be realistic and let environmental activists indulge in a little politically motivated rhetoric? Aaron HannaWashington  To the Editor: John Tierney provides a valuable critique of climatic wishful thinking, but takes his argument too far in dismissing valid concerns about global warming. Many studies indicate that temperatures are steadily rising  and that a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture and therefore will provoke more storminess.  There is more here than a “bias in weather divination.” While psychology is at work in the human mind, carbon dioxide has no ideology or bias. More carbon dioxide, in the long run, retains more heat. This is fair reason for concern. Bruce E. JohansenOmaha Science Times welcomes letters from readers.
