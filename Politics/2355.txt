EVENT 3 Time: 3:36 p.m., Jan. 4 Place: Guthrie Center, Iowa (population: 1,569) Site: Prime Time Restaurant, a bar-and-grill with an exposed brick wall and beer served in mason jars Food: cheddar cheese balls, bam bam jumbo shrimp, Frisco burger Mood: pregame happy hour Art: Painting of a tiger staring menacingly into the distance Attendee admission: Mr. Cruzâs plans to abolish the Internal Revenue Service received an instant endorsement from a man seated beside him during his speech. âIâm getting audited on Wednesday,â the visitor said. Highlight: Mr. Cruz recalled a tantrum from his then-three-year-old daughter Caroline, who had wanted to ride in a car with her friends during a family vacation. That night, after a conversation with her mother, Caroline began to pray. âDear Jesus,â she said. âTonight, we had a situation. And Iâm not sorry. But itâs not going to happen again.â The anecdote had a point, Mr. Cruz suggested, semi-convincingly: âIn those words, it sums up where this country is.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
