EXETER, N.H. â George E. Pataki may be the most centrist candidate running for the Republican presidential nomination, but there was nothing moderate about his criticism of Hillary Rodham Clinton during his announcement speech Thursday. The former New York governor, who presented himself as more of a nonpartisan problem-solver than a political bomb-thrower, ridiculed Mrs. Clinton in a series of crowd-pleasing lines. Arguing for Republican economic policies, Mr. Pataki insisted that his party, rather than the Democrats, was best fit to represent ordinary Americans. He alluded in caustic remarks to the Clinton family’s accumulation of wealth through paid speech-making. “We are the party of the middle class â unless by ‘middle class,’ they mean someone who left the White House dead broke and 10 years later had $100 million,” Mr. Pataki said. “Unless by ‘middle class,’ they mean someone who charges a poor country $500,000 for a half-hour speech.” He continued, without naming Mrs. Clinton: “She speaks for the middle class? They are the party of privilege. We are the party of the middle class.” A few minutes earlier, Mr. Pataki said that under his leadership, there would be “no special rules for the powerful,” and strongly implied that Mrs. Clinton may have broken federal laws. (He did not specify which ones.) “Our Justice Department would treat all fairly and uphold the Constitution. No one will be above the law, not even if you’re a former secretary of state whose name happens to be Clinton,” he said. Denouncing Mrs. Clinton is a political no-brainer in a Republican nominating contest, and more marginal candidates, such as Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Carly Fiorina, the Hewlett-Packard executive, have sought attention with fiery attacks on the likely Democratic nominee. Mr. Pataki, for all his ideological moderation, is evidently no exception. A Clinton campaign spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Patakiâs remarks.
