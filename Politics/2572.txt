Good Wednesday morning from Washington, where there is some potential movement on trade and even on the issue of needle exchange. But as a conference of Latino elected officials invites candidates to speak, immigration is sure to be back in the national conversation. This week highlights one of the issues defining the contours of the 2016 election: immigration. For weeks, Hillary Rodham Clinton has said she would go further to halt deportations than President Obama has with executive orders. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who has proved a strong candidate on the Republican side, is the son of immigrants and has made their story a central part of his personal narrative. And Jeb Bush, whose wife, Columba Bush, grew up in Mexico, spoke fluent Spanish during his announcement speech in Miami on Monday, and, in response to protesters, gave an unplanned endorsement of overhauling immigration. Though the issue has already maintained a strong presence in the race, a relatively small cattle call moves it briefly center stage. At the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials convention in Las Vegas, starting Wednesday and continuing through Friday, Mrs. Clinton will be a featured speaker, as will Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The only Republican candidate scheduled to make a live appearance is Ben Carson. Though Mr. Rubio will not attend â his aides cited a scheduling conflict â he and Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, are expected to seek support from Hispanic voters, a fast-emerging group in battleground states. Mr. Bush vowed in his announcement speech that the next occupant of the White House would enact âmeaningfulâ changes to immigration, an issue that has bedeviled Republican lawmakers and enraged the partyâs base. The speech was well received, and he seemed presidential over television screens, which was how most people watched the speech. Mr. Bush will also skip the Naleo convention, heading to Iowa for his first visit to the early voting state as a declared candidate. He will send a video to the conference instead.

Mrs. Clinton will be in South Carolina, one of the crucial early voting states, where she will discuss a need for youth job training as part of her larger economic plan. Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, will be in Iowa, making several appearances. And Mr. Obama will speak at a ceremony honoring Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. Later, he will host members of Congress at the White House for a picnic, where the trade deal is sure to come up over their paper cups. The battle over how to handle sexual assault in the military has quieted a bit over the last year, but as a Senate vote showed on Tuesday, lawmakers remain deeply divided â and not by party â over the best path toward ending it, suggesting that the issue will continue to confront Congress. Senators narrowly rejected an amendment to a broad defense bill offered by Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, that would have given military prosecutors rather than commanders the power to decide which sexual assault crimes to try. The amendment needed 60 votes; Ms. Gillibrand got 50 including Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, and several other conservative Republicans including some newcomers to the chamber. Ms. Gillibrandâs efforts have been rejected in the past in favor of more modest legislation. Because the military has made strides in reporting and, in some cases, addressing assault, some pressure has lifted. But the new chairman of the committee, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said in a recent interview that the issue remained vitally important to him, even as he disagreed with her approach. At a news conference, Ms. Gillibrand vowed to fight on: “Once again, a majority of the U.S. Senate supported a strongly bipartisan measure to finally hold the military accountable and create a fair, non-biased military justice system,â she said. âYet, once again, Senate filibuster rules protected military brass. Still, we will not back down.â — Jennifer Steinhauer It’s been a mainstay of the Republican antidrug message for years: no federal dollars for needle exchange programs. Since the Reagan era, Republicans have seen such efforts as tantamount to the federal government endorsing drug use. That seems to be changing. Faced with a surge of AIDS and hepatitis cases in several states, Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee have backed a new compromise approach that would still ban federal spending on the needles themselves, but would allow grant money to support the broader effort. The turnabout on programs that have been found to work in cutting disease is more proof that direct experience with problems on the ground can lead lawmakers to modify their views. — Carl Hulse There are at least five Catholics among the possible Republican presidential candidates, and Pope Francis‘s positions on climate change could put intense pressure on them to respond. Now that he no longer has to worry about being an all-but-declared candidate, Mr. Bush seems at ease on the trail.  And Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, who has been exploring a run for the presidency, visited Michigan on Tuesday, suggesting to local business leaders that his rÃ©sumÃ© would make him a strong candidate. Neil Young is upset that Mr. Trump used his song âRockinâ in the Free Worldâ during his announcement speech. During his presidential kickoff, Donald J. Trump regaled listeners with tales of his skill as a salesman and negotiator. Another talent, unmentioned by the candidate, was on vivid display: Mr. Trumpâs gift for trash talk. Mr. Trump, who speaks with all the subtlety of a Gatling gun, unloaded on two other Republicans, Mr. Bush and, briefly, Mr. Rubio. There is plenty more where that came from. With his chances of winning the presidential nomination virtually nil, Mr. Trumpâs most likely role is as a wild-card assailant. Should he qualify for the televised debates, Mr. Trump may well be the most aggressive, least predictable person on stage. It is no accident that Mr. Trumpâs first targets were Mr. Bush (âHow the hell can you vote for this guy?â) and Mr. Rubio (âHe was unable to answer the question: Is Iraq a good thing or a bad thing?â) Republicans who have met with Mr. Trump say he speaks of them with undisguised scorn. Mr. Trump has also repeatedly voiced disdain for Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive whom he views as a failure in business. For someone like Mr. Bush, however, who has positioned himself closer to the political middle, it may be easier to have the host of âThe Apprenticeâ as a vocal antagonist than a more credible conservative challenger. — Alexander Burns In her trip to South Carolina, The Washington Times says, Mrs. Clinton is facing “post-Obama apathy” as she seeks to “energize” black voters in the state. As Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin faces a budget battle back home, he has taken four foreign trips, three of them paid for by taxpayers, The Washington Post reports. And both FiveThirtyEight, and The Wall Street Journal consulted charts to gauge Mr. Trump‘s chances, but the conclusions were a bit different. Jeb Bush has spent months struggling to address his presidential family ties, stumbling over questions about Iraq while declaring that he is his own man. On Tuesday night, he took a different approach while appearing on âThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.â Asked by Mr. Fallon about how he would deal with comparisons with his father and brother, Mr. Bush proudly said that there was no comparison with the elder George Bush, whom he called the greatest man alive. But the praise for his brother, former President George W. Bush, was a little more faint. âMy brother, I would say, is a significantly better artist than I am,â Mr. Bush said with a chuckle. âIâm still doing stick drawings, and he can actually paint.â As for his own strengths, Mr. Bush said, âIâm a whole lot younger and better looking.â Mr. Bush also opened up about his marriage, telling the story of how he met Columba when he was building a schoolhouse during an exchange program in Mexico when he was 21. Struck by love at first sight, Mr. Bush said he lost his appetite and could not sleep after they met, causing him to lose 20 pounds. Communication was also an issue at first, Mr. Bush explained, as his Spanish was ânot so hotâ and she was not much better at English. However, the young couple persevered. âWhen youâre in love, you can overcome those barriers pretty quick,â Mr. Bush said. âThereâs another language that matters the most.â — Alan Rappeport Like the Politics Newsletter?
