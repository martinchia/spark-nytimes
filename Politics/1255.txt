GREENVILLE, S.C. — Jeb Bush invited a firestorm on Friday by saying that âstuff happensâ in reference to renewed calls for legislative action after tragedies like the mass shooting in Oregon. âI had this challenge as governor because we had â look, stuff happens,â he said at a forum in South Carolina. âThereâs always a crisis and the impulse is always to do something, and itâs not necessarily the right thing to do.â The inelegant phrase immediately set off a wave of criticism from observers suggesting he was playing down the scourge of gun violence and the tragedy on Thursday, in which a gunman killed nine people at a community college in Roseburg, Ore. Mr Bush, taking questions from the state’s attorney general, Alan Wilson, was speaking about a pattern of proposing legislative responses that he said did not halt the tragedies they were meant to stop.  Asked afterward about the “stuff happens” comment, Mr. Bush said, âit wasnât a mistake,â and requested that a reporter point out âwhat I said wrong.â âThings happen all the time,â Mr. Bush said. âThings. Is that better?â Asked what he meant, Mr. Bush said he was talking more generally about the tendency to pass laws in response to tragic events. âTragedies,” he said.  “A child drowned in a pool and the impulse is to pass a law that puts fencing around pools. Well it may not change it.  Or you have a car accident and the impulse is to pass a law that deals with that unique event. And the cumulative effect of this is, in some cases, you donât solve the problem by passing the law, and youâre imposing on large numbers of people burdens that make it harder for our economy to grow, make it harder to protect liberty.â Mr. Bush said he was not referring specifically to Oregon when he said “stuff happens.” At the forum at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., Mr. Bush boasted of his pro-gun record as Florida governor, recalling awards he received from the National Rifle Association and noting that he once received a gun from the groupâs former president, Charlton Heston.   At a news conference in Washington, President Obama was asked to respond to Mr. Bush’s comments after being read a small portion of them. âI donât even think I have to react to that one,â Mr. Obama said, adding, âThe American people should hear that.â A spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, Allie Brandenburger, said in an email that Mr. Bush’s critics were “taking shameless advantage of a horrific tragedy.” âIt is sad and beyond craven that liberal Democrats, aided and abetted by some in the national media, would dishonestly take Governor Bushâs comments out of context in a cheap attempt to advance their political agenda in the wake of a tragedy,” she said. President Obama responded on Friday to the âstuff happensâ comment from the Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush about the mass shooting in Oregon. By MICHAEL D.
