The Supreme Court’s decision on the Affordable Care Act subsidies left Republicans in Congress badly divided on their next steps.  This year, the House and Senate approved a budget that included the same parliamentary twist that helped secure the Affordable Care Act’s passage. So-called “reconciliation” would allow Republicans to pass major health care changes that cannot be filibustered in the Senate â as long as those changes impact the government’s spending and revenue. House Speaker John A. Boehner said repeatedly that no decision had been made on how reconciliation would be used. That seemed to throw cold water on members of his conference pledging to move forward quickly after Thursday’s court decision. If the court had sided with the plaintiffs, Republicans had hoped to force President Obama to negotiate a new health care law more to their liking. Now, any significant legislation will simply be vetoed, Republicans conceded. That leaves them with a decision: Try to do something modest that could overcome a veto, or press forward with a true replacement for the Affordable Care Act? House Republicans vowed to press forward.  “The presidentâs made it clear heâs not signing anything, even bipartisan bills,” said Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and a leading health care legislator on the House Ways and Means Committee. “He will continue to be an obstructionist, so we are going to have to focus on what we think is right.” Lawmakers can make changes to the health care law’s tax increases and spending provisions, but they cannot make policy changes that do not impact the government’s finances, like regulations on the insurance market, and possibly the mandates on health care coverage Republicans dislike the most. Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia and the chairman of the House Budget Committee, who wrote the “reconciliation” language, said he would press forward with a full replacement of the A.C.A. “The goal is to get the American people to speak loudly enough through their representatives to get this administration moving in the right direction,” he said. But it was also clear the court ruling would slow that process. And Senate Republicans were not nearly as enthusiastic. “I wouldn’t want to say anything is fruitless because around here you do what you can do at the time you can do it,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, one of the small group of Republicans who tried to write the health care law before ultimately abandoning it.  Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas and one of the leadership’s point people in preparing for the decision, said he would introduce draft legislation to replace the A.C.A. But, he said, that would only begin the discussion. “We’re not going to do what the Democrats did and ram this through,” he said.
