As President Obama held a town-hall-style event in Virginia on Thursday evening to discuss his executive actions on gun control, one of his loudest critics, Donald J. Trump, promised a crowd of more than 1,400 people in Burlington, Vt., that he would eliminate gun-free zones in schools on his first day in office. The two events express the divide between the two presidential primary races on the issue of guns, which have been a focal point since the fatal shooting in June of nine churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., the site of next weekâs Republican debate. Mr. Obamaâs proposals for curbing the accessibility of guns â a move he said he was forced to take because previous efforts stalled in Congress â had support from 67 percent of people surveyed in a CNN poll released on Thursday.  But the split-screen debates in the two party primaries tell a different story. Among the three Democratic primary candidates, there has been an effort to talk about the importance of adding gun control measures â and Hillary Clinton and Martin OâMalley have faulted Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a state with a thriving gun culture, for his record on the issue.  Among Republicans, there has been very little distinguishing the candidates in their language about Mr. Obamaâs measures. Almost uniformly, they have criticized what they have called a government overreach. Few have gone as far as Mr. Trump did in Burlington, where Mr. Sanders is a former mayor. The general election may tell whether that divide can be bridged. Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, told a crowd in Burlington, Vt., on Thursday that the executive actions on gun control signed by President Obama can be undone by the next president.
