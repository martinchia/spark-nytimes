Updated, 1:06 p.m. |  Carly Fiorina waded into the politics of vaccinations on Thursday, explaining to a group in Iowa that she believes parents should have the option not to vaccinate their children. The Republican presidential candidate appeared to be sticking to the party line in her position, explaining that vaccines should be a matter of personal and religious freedom. She recounted a story about feeling pressured by a school nurse to allow her young daughter to receive a vaccine for human papillomavirus. Mrs. Fiorina said that in cases of highly contagious diseases with proven vaccines, schools should be allowed to prevent students from attending. But, she added, that should not be the rule in all cases. âI think when weâre talking about some of these more esoteric immunizations, then I think absolutely a parent should have a choice and a school district shouldnât be able to say, âSorry, your kid canât come to schoolâ for a disease thatâs not communicable, thatâs not contagious, and where there really isnât any proof that theyâre necessary at this point,â Mrs. Fiorina told reporters, according to a report in Time magazine. Vaccinations have become a perennial debate in politics, often pitting candidates against the scientific community.  Former Gov. George Pataki, a rival to Mrs. Fiorina whose campaign is struggling to gain traction, criticized her comments on Friday. Not sure how you run a major tech company @HP & reject accepted science that has eradicated diseases like small pox & polio @CarlyFiorina — George E. Pataki (@GovernorPataki) August 14, 2015  This year, Senator Rand Paul, who is an eye doctor, raised eyebrows when he seemed to suggest that he believes that vaccines can lead to mental disorders. He later said later said that he is not opposed to vaccines and posed for a booster shot. Four years ago, former Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota caused controversy when she said the H.P.V. vaccine can lead to “mental retardation.”  And former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, a candidate for president again in 2016, said that he had made the wrong decision by mandating the vaccine in Texas.  Mrs. Fiorina’s comments come a year after an unusual polio-like illness was seen in dozens of children in her home state of California.
