With Wednesday the new deadline on Capitol Hill, congressional negotiators on Sunday reported progress on a $1.1 trillion spending deal that has proved elusive. Top aides said the measure could finally be made public on Monday, which would represent a breakthrough after weeks of struggle over what policy restrictions could be included as legislative riders. The federal government is operating under a new short-term funding bill that will expire at midnight on Wednesday. Congressional leaders could again extend funding for a few more days to buy additional time. But the White House has shown little patience for anything beyond that, putting added pressure on lawmakers to act before leaving for the holidays. An added complication is a major tax bill that other members of Congress are negotiating. Democrats have become increasingly unhappy about the size and shape of the tax bill. If congressional leaders decide to combine the two huge measures for one big year-end vote, it could drive off Democrats believed to be needed for approval. No matter how the House and Senate choose to proceed, the pressure to finish up will be intense.
