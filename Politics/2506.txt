The super PAC backing Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who was relegated to the second-tier debate panel on Thursday in Cleveland, will broadcast an ad on Fox News in Iowa during the main event.  The spot, which will be aired by the Believe Again Super PAC, will later run statewide on broadcast and cable television in Iowa, where Mr. Jindal has made repeated trips and where he has focused much of his energy as a Republican presidential candidate.  “The debate in Cleveland is all about a celebrity, but one candidate is moving up where it counts, in Iowa: Bobby Jindal,” the narrator says in the ad.  The ad cuts to Mr. Jindal saying, “If you elect somebody to D.C. that wants to be popular with the mainstream media, we are done as a country.” Iowans Mr. Jindal has met at town-hall-style meetings are then featured in the ad. The super PAC, which is legally barred from coordinating with the campaign, is trying to send a message that the debate is merely one night of cable broadcast.  Mr. Jindal is polling low, but has been drawing large crowds.
