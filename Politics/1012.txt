Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Democratic National Committee have finalized a joint fund-raising agreement after months of negotiations, opening the door for the party to gain a significant head start on Republicans at roping in big checks from Democratic donors. The agreement will allow Mrs. Clinton to participate in events that raise money simultaneously for her campaign and for the Democratic National Committee, allowing the party to capitalize on her celebrity and popularity with donors to fill the rooms at party events.  While party committees can accept far larger contributions than candidates — $33,400 a year versus the $2,700 Mrs. Clinton can accept for the primary — donors are sometimes more inclined to write those checks if a popular candidate or elected official is attending the event. Party officials and a Clinton spokeswoman said the party organizations would face no restrictions on spending the money aside from those already mandated by law and that the cash and would be available no matter who the Democratic nominee was. “Hillary Clinton has always been a believer in party-building and is thrilled to be able to partner with the D.N.C. in order to leverage her fund-raising efforts on behalf of the national and state partiesâ work to elect a Democrat to the White House in 2016,” Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, said in a statement. The decision follows commitments by four state Democratic parties this week to jointly raise funds with Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. The finalization of the agreement was announced at a D.N.C. meeting in Minneapolis on Thursday and was reported by The Washington Post.  For any jointly-raised contribution, Mrs. Clinton will get the first $2,700 and the D.N.C. the next $33,400. Participating state parties would split any cash that remained. The decision has even more import thanks to new rules passed by Congress that permit parties to raise large checks for new accounts reserved for legal fees, real estate costs and the quadrennial national conventions. Unlike in past years, party officials will be able to solicit commitments of up to a million dollars for each election cycle from their most generous donors. Whether Mrs. Clinton and her party can capitalize on the agreement quickly remains to be seen. The party contribution limits apply annually, meaning that checks for the 2015 calendar year cannot be raised retroactively after Dec. 31. August and December are traditionally slow fund-raising months, effectively giving the Democrats September, October, and November to maximize the opportunity. No events have been scheduled yet, a D.N.C. spokeswoman said.
