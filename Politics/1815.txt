BOULDER, Colo. â Viewers of Wednesday’s Republican debate here will be treated to a decidedly liberal perspective â at least for 30 seconds. NextGen Climate, the outside group founded by the billionaire environmentalist and philanthropist Tom Steyer, is airing an ad on CNBC â the business network hosting the debate â during the prime-time face-off Wednesday that will cast climate change as an economic issue.  The 30-second spot, “Who We Are,” will run as part of a six-figure buy that also includes several days of digital ads, the group said. “Tomorrowâs debate will focus on the economy â and itâs hard to ignore the biggest threat to our economy: climate change,” said Suzanne Henkels, spokeswoman for NextGen Climate. “Weâve seen the G.O.P. candidates use the economy as an excuse for dodging questions on climate change, but in fact not addressing climate change would cost us $44 trillion in lost global G.D.P.” The ad opens with black-and-white footage of moments of American achievement, as a narrator says: “America has never been a country of quitters. It’s not who we are.” “We don’t ignore threats like climate change â we face our problems head on,” the narrator continues, as images of everyday Americans, as well as wind farms, scroll by. “With American-made clean energy, we can end our dependence on foreign oil, spark new innovation and create millions of new jobs.” This month, NextGen Climate announced a seven-figure ad campaign urging the 2016 presidential candidates to commit to achieving 50 percent clean energy by 2030. And during the 2014 cycle, the group spent about $100 million to try to influence several key Senate and governor’s races, where climate change was expected to play a significant role.
