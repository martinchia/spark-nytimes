It seems Representative RaÃºl R. Labrador has a considerable view of his singular ability to oust a speaker, tame federal spending and decapitate special interests. We know this, because he is trying to raise money by saying so.  In a letter to donors, Mr. Labrador, a Republican from Idaho elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010, reminds them that, like all members of the House, he is a perpetual candidate in need of cash. He reassures them that âyour support is the reason I sat in Speaker Boehnerâs office and gave him an ultimatum: Change the way youâre running the House of Representatives or step down. The next day, he resigned from Congress.â  Actually, several conservative members, many of them in the loosely formed Freedom Caucus, of which Mr. Labrador is a member, went after former Speaker John A. Boehner for the better part of a year. Mr. Boehner announced this fall that he would end his career in Congress. He was replaced in the speakerâs chair by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.  Mr. Labrador points out that he âdidnât stop there,â and that he âtold special interest groups that enough was enough and extracted $2 trillion in reduced spending over the next 10 years.â It is not clear what budget measure Mr. Labrador is referring to, but he generally votes against bipartisan budget deals and was not a major player in any fiscal negotiation. He did have a role in attempts to come up with immigration legislation, but he did not refer to this in his letter.
