Former Gov. Jeb Bush is challenging some long-held tenets of conservative tax policy with a populist plan that targets valuable deductions that benefit the wealthy and the “carried interest” loophole that has enriched hedge fund managers for years.  Mr. Bush took his tax plan directly to the business world on Wednesday in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that details his strategy of reducing corporate taxes and personal income taxes while eliminating provisions that favor the wealthiest Americans. The plan is intended to spur the economy to grow at an annual rate of 4 percent by giving companies incentives to invest domestically and by easing the tax burdens on low and middle-income families. “Low growth, crony capitalism and easy debtÂ â thatâs President Obamaâs economic agenda in a nutshell, and the tax code has helped make it possible,” Mr. Bush wrote ahead of an economic policy speech in North Carolina. “Itâs past time for a change.” Mr. Bush’s plan would cut individual rates from seven brackets to three, taxing income at 28 percent, 25 percent and 10 percent. It doubles the standard tax deduction that most filers take, ends what Republicans call the “death tax” on estates of the deceased and promises to make marriage more beneficial for tax purposes. The proposal also cuts the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, which Mr. Bush notes is 5 percentage points below China’s rate. To pay for the cuts, Mr. Bush says he will end the practice of worldwide taxation that has spurred the trend of corporate “inversions,” when companies use cross-border mergers to benefit from lower tax rates abroad. He would also assess a one-time tax on corporate cash stashed overseas and he would eliminate the interest deductions that companies take when they borrow.  Mr. Bush also put carried interest in his sights, suggesting that fund managers will no longer benefit from lower rates on investments. âWe will treat all noninvestment income the same, so unless you stake capital in an investment, you wonât be able to claim the capital-gains tax rate on your market gains,â he wrote. In devising the plan, Mr. Bush has taken pages from the populist playbook that has been employed by Donald J. Trump that will likely anger some companies that rely heavily on borrowing for investment. He also takes a subtle jab at Mr. Trump, suggesting that his idea of using tariffs to protect American companies is not a conservative approach. “Liberals will tell you that we need walls and tariffs to protect U.S. businesses from international competitors,” Mr. Bush wrote. “The liberals are wrong; we need tax reform.” A spokeswoman for Mr. Bush’s campaign would not say how long he projects it would take to achieve 4 percent economic growth or what impact the tax would have in deficits in the short term. Democrats pounced on Mr. Bush’s proposal on Wednesday as strategy that would most benefit the rich and impose new costs on the middle class. “More massive tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations, all while exploding the deficit or shifting the burden onto the middle class — an even more extreme plan than his brother’s,” said Holly Shulman, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee.
