Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is no stranger to the politically loaded gaffe, but on Tuesday in New York, it was his turn to chuckle when a foreign counterpart blurted out what everyone was thinking. âMr. President,â Kristian Jensen, the foreign minister of Denmark, said while addressing Mr. Biden at a United Nations summit meeting on countering violent extremism. âVice President â sorry,â he added quickly. âWell, could have been! Can be! Who knows?â Mr. Jensen continued, as a smiling Mr. Biden gazed down from the dais where he was leading the gathering. Mr. Jensen said that if Mr. Biden had some news to share, “please let us know.â The vice president did not. But the Danish minister’s remark was a reminder that as Mr. Biden flitted from meeting to meeting in New York on Tuesday, speculation about his presidential ambitions was never far behind. Rumors that the vice president is on the brink of a decision about whether to pursue his partyâs 2016 nomination have intensified this week. Aides have suggested it could be weeks before he reaches a conclusion â or much sooner. Disembarking from Air Force Two at LaGuardia Airport on Tuesday morning, Mr. Biden all but assured reporters traveling with him that he would not be making news, joking that they might even need some help staying awake through the antiterrorism summit, which at more than three hours was heavy with speeches and mostly devoid of light moments.  But just as it was about to end, Mr. Jensen changed all that. After his slip, Federica Mogherini, the European Unionâs foreign policy chief, took care in her remarks to emphasize the âviceâ in âvice president,â to more chuckles from Mr. Biden and the roomful of attendees.  When the meeting adjourned, Mr. Jensen approached Mr. Biden and the two shared a private laugh, off-mike, where neither could raise any eyebrows.
