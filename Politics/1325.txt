President Obama will join Chris Wallace on âFox News Sundayâ this weekend for a televised interview from Chicago. It is the first time that he will be on âFox News Sundayâ since being elected president. He was last on the program in 2008, when he was a United States senator from Illinois. The president has been a rare guest on the network, but he hasnât completely ignored it throughout his tenure. In 2013, he sat for an interview with Mr. Wallace, with a focus on the situation in Syria. And last year, he did an interview with Bill OâReilly during the Super Bowl coverage. A news release from Fox News said the interview topics will include the battle over Merrick Garlandâs Supreme Court nomination, the presidential election and Mr. Obamaâs legacy. The interview will be broadcast on the Fox broadcast networks, with replays on the Fox News cable channel at 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Eastern time.
