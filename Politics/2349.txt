MANCHESTER, N.H. â A middle-aged gay man confronted Senator Marco Rubio here on Monday over his opposition to same-sex marriage, pointedly asking, âWhy do you want to put me back in the closet?â âI donât,â Mr. Rubio replied. âYou can live any way you want.â The tense exchange inside the Puritan Backroom diner ended with Mr. Rubio walking away and the displeased voter calling him a âtypical politician.â Mr. Rubio, who is seeking to win over conservatives, is seldom asked about gay rights at his campaign stops. But courting voters in a crowded New Hampshire diner on the eve of the primary is an unpredictable business. The voter, who identified himself as Timothy Kierstead, was seated at a table with his mother and his husband when Mr. Rubio walked up behind him, according to pool reports of the encounter. During a brief conversation, Mr. Kierstead, 50, told Mr. Rubio that he was married but complained that the senatorâs position amounted to him declaring that âwe donât matter.â Mr. Rubio, who was standing with his youngest son, Dominick, 8, by his side, gently disagreed. âNo, I just believe marriage is between one man and one woman.â âWell,â replied Mr. Kierstead, âthatâs your belief.â Mr. Rubio continued: âI think thatâs what the law should be. And if you donât agree you should have the law changed by a legislature.â Mr. Kierstead said the law had already been changed, referring either to a Supreme Court ruling that has legalized same-sex marriage across the country or to state legislation in New Hampshire that did the same. Mr. Rubio decided to conclude their conversation. âI respect your view,â he said, patting Mr. Kierstead on the shoulder and starting to walk away. Mr. Kierstead was unsatisfied. âTypical politician,â he said loudly. âWalk away.â In an interview afterward, Mr. Kierstead offered a portrait of his life: He owns a restaurant in Manchester, and he and his husband have three children. He is a registered independent and said he would cast his vote for a Democrat on Tuesday because Republicans did not support his right to marry. âThey want to take my rights away as a citizen of the United States,â said Kierstead said. âLove is love,â he added. âPeople donât choose who they are going to love.â Mr. Kierstead said his mother and husband had approved of his confrontation with Mr. Rubio, for the most part. âHe knew I wouldnât shut up,â he said of his spouse. Sexuality, it seems, was a recurring theme during Mr. Rubioâs visit to the diner. A different patron in the same restaurant, a 92-year-old woman, asked Mr. Rubio about the personal life of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. âHeâs a bachelor, right?â the woman asked.  “He is,â Mr. Rubio said.  Then she asked, âIs he gay?â Mr. Rubio chuckled. âNo,â he replied.
