The next Republican presidential debate will have stricter polling criteria for candidates to make the main stage, potentially winnowing the field, the debate’s sponsor said Wednesday. Candidates such as Senator Rand Paul, Gov. Chris Christie and Mike Huckabee, who have all been struggling in recent polls, could be relegated to the second tier if their numbers do not improve, and Senator Lindsey Graham could be shut out entirely.  CNBC, the sponsor of the Oct. 28 debate, will stick with the two-tiered debate system that Fox and CNN employed in the two earlier Republican presidential debates, but it will use a polling threshold that will raise the bar for candidates to participate in the later debate.  The network said that it would use national polls to determine which candidates appear in the undercard debate at 6 p.m. and who participates in the prime-time event at 8 p.m. The debates will be at the University of Colorado in Boulder.  To make the cut in the later debate, candidates will need to be polling at 3 percent in an average of national polls conducted by NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, CNN and Bloomberg that were released from  Sept. 17 to Oct. 21. A candidate will have to be polling at a minimum of 1 percent in at least one national poll in that period to be invited to appear in either debate.  Networks have split the debates out of concern that the crowded Republican field would make it difficult for candidates to get sufficient airtime. The threshold is a shift from the two previous debates, which aimed to narrow the stage to 10 candidates based on polling averages. Carly Fiorina’s strong performance in the first undercard debate helped her emerge from the pack, and CNN eventually adjusted its rules to help her make it into the prime-time stage for the second debate.  Making the later debate is important both as a matter of pride and for reaching the greatest number of potential voters. CNN’s prime-time debate on Sept. 16 reached nearly 23 million viewers, while its undercard had an audience of 6.3 million.  The Republican National Committee praised CNBC’s criteria. “We have the most diverse and experienced field of candidates in history, and we applaud CNBCâs efforts to ensure that all of our top candidates will have an opportunity to share their views with the American people,â Reince Priebus, the committee’s chairman, said.  Meanwhile, candidates who are on the cusp of making the main stage expressed confidence that they would be there.  “Right now, we are in the clear for the prime debate,” said Sergio Gor, a spokesman for Mr. Paul’s campaign. “We look forward to seeing Senator Rand Paul on the main stage in Colorado.” Samantha Smith, a spokeswoman for Mr. Christie, noted that his polling average currently is high enough that the New Jersey governor would have to have a particularly rough stretch over the next couple of weeks to fall below the polling floor.  “We are averaging 3.75 (percent) right now and will be on the debate stage,” Ms. Smith said.  The party’s third debate is expected to focus on jobs, taxes and the economy.
