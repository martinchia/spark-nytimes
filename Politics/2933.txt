President Obama has had a sometimes rocky relationship with unions â and the workers they represent. Just this week, union leaders expressed displeasure at the administrationâs concluding of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that unions fear will be bad for workers. But that has not stopped Mr. Obama from wooing workers. On Wednesday, the White House will host the âSummit on Worker Voice,â an effort to give unions, organizers and some businesses a platform to discuss wages and other issues. âItâs in the numbers,â Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama, writes in an email Wednesday morning. âFirms with unionized workers have higher retention and higher productivity.â Mr. Obama has won praise from some unions for enacting overtime rules, expanding access to paid leave, helping to enact an equal pay act for women and pushing â so far unsuccessfully in Congress â for an increase in the minimum wage. The Worker Voice summit meeting will be going on all day, starting with a breakfast in the East Wing. But the centerpiece of the day will be remarks by Mr. Obama, who aides said would âstart a conversation with workers, employers, unions, organizers and other advocates and experts on how we can energize a new generation of Americans to come together and recognize the potential power of their voice at work.â
