Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These areÂ the places, faces and culinary selectionsÂ of 2016âs first proper bus tour. EVENT 20 Time: 2:01 p.m., Jan. 8 Place: Osage, Iowa (population: 3,619) Site: Teluwut Grille House & Pub, stuffed with T-shirts and assorted images of adult beverages. Mood: monkey-business casual Food: breaded broccoli, loaded criss cuts, hog wild wings Emotionally conflicted sign: âDo one brave thing a day â¦ and then run like hellâ Ominous sign: âIf these walls could talk  â¦â Highlight: An attendee, capping an occasionally profane preface, asked Mr. Cruz if he had âthe brass onesâ to effect change. The crowd roared. âI want to thank you for what is officially the most colorful question weâve had on the bus tour,â Mr. Cruz said. âI have to say, itâs hard to know where to start.â After some well-worn stump-speech fodder, Mr. Cruz got around to his central thought: In the Republican race, he suggested, no one could match him âwhen it comes to strength of spine, or other body parts.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
