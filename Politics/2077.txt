DES MOINES â Seven Republican candidates in search of evangelical votes in Iowa will audition on Friday before a group promoting âChristlike leadershipâ in government. The host of the forum, Bob Vander Plaats, is an influential leader of the Christian right in the state, and he has promised to make an endorsement soon after. That backing will bring with it a network of church-based activists and organizers for Iowa’s caucuses next year. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who is already backed by two of the three most influential social conservatives in the state, Representative Steve King and Steve Deace, a talk radio host, is widely thought to have an edge with Mr. Vander Plaats, which would add to a narrative of evangelicals coalescing around one candidate. But Ben Carson, the current leader in the polls among evangelicals, is also thought to be a strong contender. Mr. Vander Plaats, who many establishment Republicans quietly despise, likes above all else to go with a winner. In the past two presidential cycles, he backed the caucus victor, Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Rick Santorum in 2012, both of whom rode to the top with evangelical support. The other candidates attending are Mr. Huckabee, Mr. Santorum, Carly Fiorina, and Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky. Donald J. Trump, the current leader in Iowa polls, is a notable no-show. Even though Mr. Trump likes to proclaim, âI love the evangelicals,ââ he is done with multicandidate cattle calls now that he draws thousands to his own rallies. Three establishment Republicans, Jeb Bush and Governors Chris Christie of New Jersey and John R. Kasich of Ohio, are all otherwise engaged. Kedron Bardwell, a political scientist at Simpson College in Iowa with an expertise in religion, said the politically active evangelical electorate is far from decided. âTheyâre really scrutinizing these candidates hard,ââ he said. âThey want to know who fits the model of biblically based governance.ââ Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
