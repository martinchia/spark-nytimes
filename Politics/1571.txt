Good Wednesday morning from Washington, where the Senate finally reached an agreement on the National Security Agency surveillance bill. Hillary Rodham Clinton has a new advocacy group, and a previously reluctant segment is warming up to Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. And the presidential race is set to add another name to its roster. Mrs. Clinton will face a third rival for the Democratic nomination on Wednesday when Lincoln Chafee, a former senator and governor of Rhode Island, reveals his plans to join the race. A Republican who became an independent and then a Democrat, Mr. Chafee is expected to announce his intentions during a foreign policy speech in the afternoon at George Mason University in Virginia. Mr. Chafee will join Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Martin OâMalley, the former Maryland governor, in challenging Mrs. Clinton for the nomination. Mr. Chafee, the only Republican in the Senate who opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, has signaled that he will press Mrs. Clinton on her support of the war. Since hinting that he might run in April, Mr. Chafee has also questioned Mrs. Clintonâs performance as secretary of state and raised concerns about foreign donations to her familyâs foundation. Political analysts in Rhode Island were surprised to learn of Mr. Chafeeâs presidential aspirations. He enters the race as a long shot, lacking Mrs. Clintonâs fund-raising prowess or name recognition and Mr. Sandersâs grass-roots support. Some have suggested that Mr. Chafee is looking to rebrand himself after opting not to seek re-election as governor amid weak poll numbers and the threat of a primary challenge. However, even critics say that he is sincere and that his presence will press Mrs. Clinton on foreign policy. âGovernor Chafee is a good and gracious man and certainly has every right to run for this office,â said Joseph McNamara, chairman of the Rhode Island Democratic Party, who noted that Mrs. Clinton has strong support in the state. âAnd although it is a little late for him to get into this race, we only wish him well.â  Alan Rappeport Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. Mr. O’Malley and Mr. Sanders will meet with members of the American Federation of Teachers, a union whose endorsement would be a tremendous lift toward the Democratic nomination. Mr. O’Malley will also speak to another crucial group, the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. President Obama will participate in “Live From the White House” interviews on the economy, a continuing series, with television anchors from Dallas, Sacramento, Seattle and other cities. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey will hold a breakfast event and will tour small businesses in Greenville, S.C. The most significant rollback of security surveillance since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks was sent to Mr. Obama on Tuesday, but the fight over security is hardly ending. The delicate negotiations that forged the U.S.A. Freedom Act, which passed the Senate 67 to 32, left big issues on the floor. That act largely dealt with surveillance authority in the U.S.A. Patriot Act, the law passed overwhelmingly after the Sept. 11 attacks. Senators and House members in both parties badly wanted to include controls on a section of a separate law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which they say has also been abused by the government. But the architects of the U.S.A. Freedom Act said that focus would have upset the compromise supported by Mr. Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner. The issue is bound to return. Senators Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, a political odd couple who helped write the U.S.A. Freedom Act, have already begun writing the next chapter. They want to close a loophole in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 that allows the government to read the content of emails that are more than six months old. In 1986, Mr. Lee was in the sixth grade. Mr. Leahy, the longest-serving senator, was in the Senate. âI was here when that passed,â he told reporters to laughter. âAt that time, everybody assumed that if you had something on your computer, an email or something, you didnât have enough capacity. In six months, it was going to be gone anyway.â He added, âIf we donât protect Americansâ privacy, I would say we are no longer secure.â — Jonathan Weisman Mr. Christie has been tackling the major parts of his expected 2016 platform speech by speech: next up, immigration. He has said that he would give a speech on the topic this month, but at the Economic Growth Summit meeting in Orlando, Fla., on Tuesday, Mr. Christie gave a brief preview. He began by laying out two concepts âthat we should all be willing to agree to.â First, the immigrants living in the country illegally are not going to self-deport. Second, there are not enough law enforcement resources to âforcibly deport those folks,â he said. While this may seem like the basis for a policy embracing a pathway to citizenship, Mr. Christie, who had previously offered tepid support for the idea, rejected it on Fox News last month. After outlining his two points, he acknowledged that the options for comprehensive overhaul get much narrower, and he became cautious in explaining how he would deal with the âforward-looking issue,â or even how to define it. But he did articulate two central aspects of his eventual immigration platform. First, he rejected the idea of âbuilding a wall or a fence along our entire border,â calling it âinefficientâ and âineffective.â He argued that anyone who wanted to would find a way through it. And he also called on employers to shoulder more of the responsibility for monitoring immigrants. âE-verify should be used by everybody, and be forced to be used by everybody,â Mr. Christie said. — Nick Corasaniti Mr. Paul‘s stances on the N.S.A. bill and on foreign intervention are beginning to ease the concerns of some backers of his father, Ron Paul. In a potential blow to Jeb Bush, who had been hoping that Nevada would switch its election process to a primary, the State Legislature opted instead to stick to its caucuses. And despite earlier hints that he might leave the Florida primary to its home-state candidates Mr. Bush and Senator Marco Rubio, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin on Tuesday, while in Florida, vowed to compete in the state and said that he would “be back many more times.â The Washington Post examines the history of the Clinton Foundation, and how its efforts to court major donors is creating problems for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. Mike Huckabee and George E. Pataki had diverging responses about Caitlyn Jenner, formerly known as Bruce, showing a gap in the party over some social issues. And Mr. Bush, a profile in New York magazine finds, “is not the Jeb Bush you think he is.” The Democratic National Committee’s finance chief is helping raise money for Mrs. Clinton, in apparent violation of party rules, Politico reports. As the presidential hopefuls declared their candidacies, USA Today reports, the resulting web traffic left “a unique digital footprint on the nation’s Facebook conversation.” Emily’s List, the Democratic advocacy group for female candidates who support abortion rights, is beginning an independent expenditure effort dedicated entirely to Mrs. Clinton. Emily’s List has been running a program, Madam President, for two years that was dedicated to promoting the concept of electing a female president. It was implicit that Mrs. Clinton would be that candidate, but now the group is making their support official. In a memo to donors, an official with the group noted that the project would be aimed at persuading and turning out female voters in targeted states and would feature extensive polling, voter contact, TV ads and digital advocacy. The official, Denise Feriozzi, wrote that it would be the most extensive independent expenditure program in the 30-year history of the organization. As part of the push, Emily’s List is taking over the social media platforms that had been controlled by Ready for Hillary, the grass-roots organization built around nudging Mrs. Clinton into the presidential race. — Jonathan Martin Like the Politics Newsletter?
