An outside group that sought to mar Senator Rand Paulâs presidential campaign kickoff with a television advertisementÂ  linking him to President Obamaâs Iran policy is going on the air with a new spot about the candidate and the recent nuclear deal. The ad is timed to start airing right after the first sanctioned Republican presidential debate on Thursday evening. It is being aired by the 501c4 groupÂ  called the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America, which does not have to reveal its donors. Mr. Paul has criticized the Iran deal as âunacceptableâ and has said he will vote against it. But the group’s goal appears to be seeking to highlight his previous support for Iran negotiations in general. The ad will run as part of a six-figure cable buy in New Hampshire and Iowa, according to officials with the group. Mr. Paul, who has struggled in the polls of late and has been drowned out by the enormous attention paid to Donald J. Trump, has been criticized for years by hawkish members of the party for his more noninterventionist views. All members of the large Republican presidential field have criticized the Iran deal in some form, but the ad highlights that Mr. Paul was open to the talks in the first place, and stresses the climate in which he is now campaigning. âRand Paul supported President Obamaâs negotiations with Iran,â the narrator says in the spot, before cutting to clips of Mr. Paul saying he was âone of the senators whoâs in favor of negotiations with Iran.â âActions have consequences,â the narrator says, adding that the deal that Mr. Obama helped reach had given Iran âa path to nuclear weapons.â âCall Rand Paul and tell him to stop siding with Obama and stand up to Iran,â the narrator concludes. Rick Reed, who was involved in the ads for the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth that were used to undercut John F. Kerry in the 2004 presidential bid and who is the president of the group running the new ads, called the Iran deal âa disasterâ and urged âconservatives to call Senator Paulâ and tell him to âstop supporting appeasement.â Doug Stafford, a top adviser to Mr. Paul, said he had not seen the ad and could not comment on specifics, but noted that Mr. Paul had âclearly and repeatedly stated his opposition to the deal.â Mr. Stafford, the chief strategist for Mr. Paul, called the spot “a lie, unfortunately typical of the Washington machine. Just like Ronald Reagan, Rand Paul believes in peace through strength — and this administration did not negotiate from strength.  They lifted sanctions too soon and ended up with a bad deal Senator Paul strenuously opposes.” Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
