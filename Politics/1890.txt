Hedieh Ghaffarian, an Iranian-born immigrant who was raised in California and built a successful floral design business, will become the next chief White House florist, the office of the first lady, Michelle Obama, announced on Thursday. Ms. Ghaffarian, who uses the nickname Roshan, will be at the White House for next week’s state dinner for President Xi Jinping of China, but officials said she would officially start in the East Wing in mid-October. âRoshanâs life story is a powerful reminder that the American dream endures,” Mrs. Obama said in a statement, “and the president and I look forward to seeing her creativity flourish for White House guests to enjoy year-round.” The previous florist, Laura Dowling, who had been in the position since Mr. Obama became president in 2009, abruptly departed in March. The White House eventually issued a statement praising Ms. Dowling’s work, calling it “always lively and colorful” and saying it reflected “not only the season but the unique and historic rooms which they graced.” But several news organizations reported that Ms. Dowling had been escorted off the grounds, and people close to the situation reported clashes between Ms. Dowling and others inside the White House residence, where the florist works. Ms. Dowling said in a statement that she was moving on to pursue other opportunities. In a statement issued by the White House on Thursday, Ms. Ghaffarian said she was “humbled” and would “dedicate myself to advancing the tradition of excellence and elegance in the White House.” Follow the New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.
