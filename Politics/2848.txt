Donald J. Trump has made a few things clear to voters as he has barnstormed the country making his case for the presidency. He will build a wall; he is very rich; and he went to Wharton â the University of Pennsylvaniaâs prestigious business school. Professors on campus are staying mostly mum about Mr. Trumpâs presidential prospects, but when it comes to his political marketing skills some of them cannot help but appreciate his results. âShort, clear statements are easy to process,â said Michael Platt, a professor of marketing and neuroscience at Wharton.  âThey do not rely on nuance or subtlety. That seems to resonate with people and possibly reinforces what I think are nonverbal signals Trump transmits, unknowingly, to the public.â Professor Platt suggested that Mr. Trumpâs celebrity and physical features â his height and his confident scowl â are exploiting ancestral mechanisms that are appealing to the general public. Studies show that when people look at a face more often, they tend to prefer it, so the attention showered upon Mr. Trump may be reinforcing his favorability. Jonah Berger, who also teaches marketing at Wharton, said that Mr. Trump might be gaining attention by shooting from the hip. âControversy drives conversation,â Professor Berger said. âI think whether on purpose or by accident, heâs done a masterful job of using controversy to keep his name in the news. â Professor Berger argues that not all publicity is good publicity, but that Mr. Trump has done a good job of walking the fine line of being offensive enough to get attention without drawing universal condemnation. The approach tends to work for generating celebrity buzz, he said, but it could prove tenuous in the long term. As for Wharton, it has been handling its own bout of Trump publicity with care. The school has asked its faculty members to avoid discussing Mr. Trumpâs politics publicly. And his incorrect use of its name â he calls it âThe Wharton School of Financeâ — has not gone unnoticed.  âHeâs not treated in the most reverent tone here,â Professor Berger said. âBut we wish all of our students well.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
