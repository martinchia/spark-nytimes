Good Monday morning from Washington, where the Capitol continues to offer its condolences to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for the death of his son Beau. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina will announce his plans to run for president on Monday and will begin a busy week on the campaign trail, but most eyes are on the Senate, where the deadline to extend a National Security Agency surveillance program has passed. Sweeping National Security Agency surveillance powers lapsed at midnight after Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, refused to allow quick approval of a House-passed measure that would have kept the laws in place while a new program is introduced. The outcome was a major embarrassment for Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, also of Kentucky. It meant that antiterrorism powers instituted after the Sept. 11 attacks were interrupted for the first time in a Congress controlled by the Republican Party, which has championed the law and its national security credentials. Mr. McConnell had pledged to avoid such messy brinkmanship if the Republicans took over the Senate. Despite the failure to avoid a shutdown of the N.S.A. program, the Senate cleared the way for eventual approval of a House bill to end the governmentâs bulk collection of telephone records. During Sunday’s unusual session, Mr. Paul acknowledged the bill would pass. But how quickly that will happen depends on Mr. Paul and other critics of the N.S.A, as a series of procedural markers approaches. Mr. Paul, who has addressed the N.S.A. fight while seeking to raise funds for his Republican presidential bid, and who has aggressively pushed the cause on social media, did not appear willing to bend much. He acknowledged that he was taking a political risk and said on the floor that some in Washington appeared to be secretly hoping for a terrorist attack “so they can blame it on me.” It was a difficult moment for Mr. McConnell. Not only did he have to allow a House bill he opposed to move forward, but he was also stymied by a home-state colleague whom he endorsed for president. Seeing parts of the U.S.A. Patriot Act expire on his watch â even temporarily â was not something he envisioned at the start of the year.  — Carl Hulse Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. Though the Florida race for the Republican nomination is thought, at least at the moment, to be a contest between the state’s own former Gov. Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio, several hopefuls will join them on Tuesday at Walt Disney World for an economic summit meeting hosted by Gov. Rick Scott. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey are expected to attend, among others. It is also a busy week for individual appearances on the campaign trail, as Mr. Rubio holds events in New York, Connecticut and Idaho; Mr. Walker will be in Georgia and North Carolina; and Mr. Graham and Donald Trump will make appearances in Iowa. As for the Democrats, Hillary Rodham Clinton will hold fund-raisers on Monday in New York City and on Long Island; and former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland will attend a question-and-answer session in Washington on Wednesday with the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. The death of Joseph R. Biden III, known as Beau, has brought out the rarest of things in Washington â a laying down of swords. Voices from across the political spectrum offered condolences to the vice president for the loss of his son, the former attorney general of Delaware. Republicans who have been deeply critical of the Obama administration immediately offered their support for the vice president, who has now outlived two of his children. “I’d like to express my sincere condolences to the entire Biden family in their moment of such deep & profound loss,” Mr. McConnell posted on Twitter. “Saddened by the news of Beau Biden’s passing. My prayers are with The Vice President, Dr. Biden and the whole family,” Mr. Bush wrote. Despite some less-than-flattering political caricatures of Mr. Biden, the vice president remains beloved in his party, and is viewed as a paternal figure and the face of empathy in the administration. Mr. Biden, whose time in Washington has spanned decades, has had a political career that many would envy, but he has also endured personal pain that few could imagine. Shortly after winning election to the Senate in 1972, his first wife, 13-month-old daughter and two sons were in a car accident. His wife and daughter died; his sons, including Beau, survived. — Maggie Haberman A bloated field of presidential candidates is about to swell further. Three more contenders are expected to enter the presidential fray this week, starting with Mr. Graham, who will make his plans known on Monday morning in his hometown, Central, S.C. Mr. Graham will bring a hawkish foreign policy voice to the race and a clear counterpoint to Mr. Paul. Mr. Graham, who lacks robust funding or strong opinion poll numbers, enters as an underdog, but he will look to use his years of experience to steer the Republican debate with his message of âsecurity through strength.â He will also reintroduce himself to an American public as someone who came from humble beginnings â his announcement will take place steps from where his family ran a liquor store and pool hall â and who can work across party lines. Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, will make his presidential plans known in Dallas on Thursday. After a failed campaign in 2012, Mr. Perry has been reviewing foreign policy issues. He has also abandoned his signature cowboy boots and started wearing dark-rimmed glasses. While the Republican field gets increasingly unwieldy, the Democrats are expected to get their fourth candidate on Wednesday, when Lincoln Chafee, the former governor and senator for Rhode Island, makes a âmajor announcementâ during a foreign policy speech at George Mason University. If anything, the mantra for this election cycle appears to be the more the merrier. — Alan Rappeport The most important political news this week may come from Carson City, Nev. That is where the State Legislature is wrapping up on Monday the session it holds every two years, but with one bit of unfinished business that has important implications for the 2016 election. A bill to change the stateâs presidential nomination contest to a primary from a caucus was passed out of an Assembly committee but has not yet been approved by the full chamber. The change is an important part of Mr. Bushâs early-state campaign strategy. Facing skepticism from some conservatives in Iowa and South Carolina and the prospect of a crowded field in New Hampshire, Mr. Bush has been counting on Nevada to give him a lift in the initial weeks of the nominating contest. Mr. Bush has already held town-hall-style meetings in the population centers of northern and southern Nevada and has paid a visit to the stateâs Republican governor, Brian Sandoval. But it is not clear how much Mr. Bush would focus his efforts on Nevada should the state retain its caucus system, which can favor more conservative candidates. With the libertarian following that Mr. Paul enjoys in the state (his father won 19 percent in Nevadaâs 2012 caucuses), another Nevada caucus may not be fertile ground for Mr. Bush. State political observers believe the switch to a primary may still pass by sine die, or adjournment, on Monday â there is support in both parties for a change that could ensure more attention and money from the candidates â but the end-of-session rush in Carson City is especially chaotic this year because the legislature is considering far-reaching tax and education measures. — Jonathan Martin Support for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont seems to be gaining momentum, with the candidate drawing overflowing crowds at rallies in Iowa late last week, the first evidence that Mrs. Clinton could face a credible challenge in the caucuses. Appearing on “Face the Nation” on CBS, for the final show hosted by Bob Schieffer, Mr. Bush said on Sunday that he had not decided whether he was running, and that he was not violating the spirit of campaign finance laws by delaying his candidacy so that he could raise more money. “Of course not,” Mr. Bush said on the matter. And Secretary of State John Kerry, who has kept a grueling pace as the United Statesâ chief diplomat, hit a curb while cycling in France and broke his leg. The accident cut short a trip to Europe that was set to begin an active month of diplomacy. An opinion poll conducted by The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics suggests that Mr. Walker’s “popularity streak in Iowa is real.” It shows him with the best ratings in the field and with the highest percentage of likely Republican caucusgoers listing him as their “first choice for president.” Mr. O’Malley’s biggest challenge in his fight for the Democratic nomination might not be from Mrs. Clinton, ABC News writes, but could come “from his own backyard” â a reference to his role, as mayor of Baltimore, in formulating the policing policies that contributed to riots in late April. And Politico reports that a campaign video for Mr. Paul showing part of his long Senate speech against the N.S.A. bill might “run afoul of Senate rules” that prohibit using the chamber’s proceedings in campaign activities. The Washington Post finds that Carly Fiorina is taking liberties with the truth when she says “every agency” of the government got “more money,” “every year.” It was an odd weekend to be celebrating in Washington â at least for lawmakers. The annual gala of the Ford’s Theater Society usually draws congressmen, senators and administration officials to celebrate the year’s Lincoln medalist. This year, the recipient is Diane Nash, a civil rights activist who was instrumental in the Freedom Rides of 1961. But Beau Bidenâs death, which prompted the White House to cancel a reception for Ms. Nash, and the Senate session over the N.S.A programs curbed the festive atmosphere. Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the minority leader in the House, walked the red carpet, but she entered the theater through a side door, avoiding the throngs in the foyer. While the evening had a more somber tone than in past galas, the attendees still managed to make room for fun. The crowd, featuring cummerbunds and chignons, sang along to Boyz II Men’s “End of the Road,” and swayed as the singer Joss Stone performed barefoot on stage. A pair of Croatian cellists performed Michael Jackson’s “Smooth Criminal,” shaking their heads wildly and high-fiving the background singers as they exited the stage. To prepare to play for one of the biggest nights in Washington, they said, they spent the day meditating and “tooth brushing.” “It’s a big honor,” Stjepan Hauser, one of the cellists, said. “My teeth â they look nice?” — Jada F.
