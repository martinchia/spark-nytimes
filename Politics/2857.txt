And then there were 17. James S. Gilmore III, the former governor of Virginia, filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday to enter the crowded field of Republican presidential contestants. He becomes the 17th prominent candidate to seek the party’s nomination. Mr. Gilmore signaled last month that he planned to embark on a long-shot White House bid. He told The Richmond Times-Dispatch that the existing candidates did not understand how to handle the international threats facing the United States and that he saw an opening. “I don’t think we’re addressing the threat to the country,” Mr. Gilmore told the newspaper. “I bring to the table experience that others don’t have.” Mr. Gilmore was governor from 1998 to 2002. He also ran for president in 2007 before dropping out of the race amid a lack of fund-raising. The following year, Mr. Gilmore ran unsuccessfully in Virginia for an open Senate seat. A former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Mr. Gilmore will enter the race too late to compete for a spot in the party’s first presidential debate, set for next Thursday. Mr. Gilmore, 65, plans a formal announcement in early August.
