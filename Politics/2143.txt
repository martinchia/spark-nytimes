Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016âs first proper bus tour. EVENT 25 Time: 12:25 p.m., Jan. 9 Place: Strawberry Point, Iowa (population: 1,279) Site: Back Home Country Cookinâ, with boisterous guests in wooden booths beneath holiday decorations and Christmas trinkets Mood: Ted Cruzâs New Yearâs Rockinâ Saturday afternoon Food: Homemade pie by Brenda Attractions within, according to outdoor signage: âWelcome! Presidential Candidate Ted Cruz,â âPiesâ Dangers below: As Mr. Cruz spoke, his daughters, Caroline and Catherine, 7 and 5, played at his feet. âIâm a little worried theyâre gonna tie my shoelaces together,â he said. âEvery parent knows, itâs much more dangerous when theyâre quiet.â He asked the crowd to kindly advise him if the girls began lighting his jeans on fire. Highlight: Mr. Cruz called on a woman who said she had four yes-or-no questions. âYes, yes, no, yes,â Mr. Cruz said quickly, to laughs. In fact, the answers were: 1) Yes, he has read the Constitution. 2) No, he does ânot remotelyâ think that Supreme Court decisions are the law of the land. 3) No, he does not support birthright citizenship. 4) No, he has not read âThe Creature From Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve.â But he has read âDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
