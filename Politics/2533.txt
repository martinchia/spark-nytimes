SAN FRANCISCO â When Jeb Bush summoned a car from Uber on Thursday morning, using the ride-hailing app to take him to Thumbtack, a consumer-service technology company, more than a dozen reporters packed around as he exited the vehicle. This was, after all, no ordinary Uber ride. The car that Mr. Bush hailed was a symbolic gambit on his part to highlight the on-demand economy â where app-driven services like Airbnb and TaskRabbit loom large, and which Republicans are increasingly pointing to as an example of the unfettered market leading to economic prosperity without the intrusive hand of government regulation. But if Mr. Bush was delighted to showcase his technological prowess, his Uber driver â a 35-year-old Yemeni named Munir Algazaly, who says he typically does not vote â failed to even recognize his famous passenger. âI had no idea,â he said with a laugh, when told that he had been ferrying Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, the son of one president and the brother of another, not to mention a 2016 presidential candidate himself. Still, Mr. Munir, who said if he does vote is likely to support Hillary Rodham Clinton, had nothing but positive things to report about Mr. Bush, who he called âa nice guy.â He said Mr. Bush had a good Uber rating â drivers rate the users, and users rate the drivers after each ride â and that the two had discussed âthe city, the traffic.â And while Republicans may like to cite Uber as an example of economic prosperity for the 21st century, an admittedly anecdotal handful of interviews with Uber drivers in San Francisco revealed a group leaning slightly more Democratic.  Vladimir Kravets, 24, from Ukraine, who was been driving for Uber for three months, said he likes the extra money, which supplements his other job at a roofing company, but âitâs not so easy, because Uber charges like 30 percent.â âIf you want to make good money, you need to spend a lot of time driving here,â he said.   And Luis Luna, 48, who has been driving Uber for about four months, said he hoped âin the future that we might have some benefits, instead of just being contractors.â âIt would be great to have regular benefits, basic benefits,â he said. âPretty much regular benefits, like health care.â When asked for his opinion about Mr. Bush, he diplomatically said he had âno comment.â But he did have some questions about Mr. Bushâs Uber ride: âSo Jeb is coming all this way to take Uber?â he asked. âWill it be a special Uber they design for him? If heâs running for president, itâs got to be safe. Itâs got to be a special Uber.â It was, in fact, a black Toyota Camry. After his question-and-answer session at a consumer-service technology company here, Mr. Bush said he had no concerns about some of the recent challenges and criticism companies like Uber are facing over their labor practices. “Thereâs going to be a big tension between companies that are disrupting the old order and if theyâve done something wrong, they should pay a fine,” he said. “But itâs a pretty vital service. I learn a lot when I go on these shared car services, I meet people that are customizing their lives in a way that should be time for celebration.” By MICHAEL BARBARO and ASHLEY PARKER Uber is part of the 2016 presidential debate, with the responsibilities of employers, the virtues of technology and the necessity of workplace regulation at issue.
