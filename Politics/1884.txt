On a day when the campaigns of Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio tried to one-up each other in terms of their solvency, Mr. Bush’s 31-year-old son took a sharp jab at the Florida senator for missing votes in Washington while running for president.  “As a Floridian, I’m a little disappointed, because he’s missing, like, 35 percent of his votes,” Jeb Bush Jr. said at an event hosted by the New York University College Republicans. “And it’s just, kind of, like, dude, you know, either drop out or do something, but we’re paying you to do something, it ain’t run for president.” His comments were reported by Politico Florida.  The younger Mr. Bush, who often makes campaign appearances before younger audiences on behalf of his father, also spoke about Jeb Bush’s organizational edge over Mr. Rubio in stark terms.  “We’re way ahead of Marco’s campaign,” Jeb Jr. said. “We’ve got four offices set up in Florida. Our national headquarters is there. Marco doesn’t have an office in Florida.” In reality, the two campaigns â who may be competing mightily for donors more than voters at this point â are facing their own advantages and disadvantages after the third fund-raising quarter of the year. Jeb Bush’s campaign raised just over $13 million, an amount that is almost what Mitt Romney raised in the third fund-raising quarter in 2011. But Mr. Bush’s team swelled in staffing and spending this year before the campaign and the “super PAC” supporting him were disentangled, creating a false sense of security about finances, according to two people with direct knowledge of the spending.  Mr. Bush began instituting a series of cost-cutting measures in the middle of the summer, but they were more widespread than his aides initially indicated.  Still, Mr. Bush’s aides and allies have been frustrated that Mr. Rubio has boasted of being on more solid footing financially. Mr. Rubio raised less than half of what Mr. Bush raised â the intake in primary dollars was less than $6 million â and their relative cash-on-hand difference is minimal. While Mr. Rubio is getting a look from some major donors, such as Sheldon Adelson, some people close to the notoriously mercurial casino magnate insist his interest in the Florida senator has been overstated.  Nonetheless, Mr. Rubio has remained quiet and focused amid increasingly sharp criticism from Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida who was once his mentor.
