LONDONDERRY, N.H. â The men of the Bush family hate being âput on the couch,â their preferred term for dismissing the news mediaâs attempts to psychoanalyze their political dynasty. But it might be worth bringing in Sigmund Freud for Jeb Bushâs latest remarks. Speaking at a town hall-style event on Thursday, Mr. Bush, unprompted, offered that he loves his mom, Barbara Bush, most of all. âI get asked all the time: âWell, are you like your brother? Are you like your dad?ââ he said. âI know thereâs a real fascination about this. Letâs just â let me get this out of the way: I love my mother more than my dad.â Well, then. But Mr. Bush wasnât done just yet. âPut aside all the 41 and 43 â who you like, all that stuff thatâs a People magazine kind of fascination,â he continued, referring to his father, George Bush, the 41st president, and his brother, George W. Bush, the 43rd president. He ended on a sweet note. âIâm blessed, thatâs all I have to tell you,â he said. âIâm blessed to be George and Barbaraâs son, and Iâm blessed to be George W.’s brother. But the world weâre in today is dramatically different than 2000, when my brother got elected, and 2001, when the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon and the plane went down in Pennsylvania.â Moments later, a voter asked him a question slightly less fraught with the burden of history â to compare and contrast himself with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, one of several more moderate candidates Jeb Bush is battling in New Hampshire.   âWell, I think Iâm much better looking,â Mr. Bush quipped, to laughter, before going on to promote his own record in the private sector, then as governor of Florida. When he had finished, nearly seven minutes later, he praised Mr. Christie â âChris is a great guyâ â but concluded, âI donât think he could give you a record of accomplishment that compares to that.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
