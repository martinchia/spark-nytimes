Former Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa gave Hillary Rodham Clinton a big endorsement Friday, writing an opinion piece in The Des Moines Register saying that she “will keep fighting” to provide opportunities for Iowans. The early endorsement from one of the state’s most beloved Democrats comes as Mrs. Clinton heads to Iowa for a swing of events. She will hold a town hall on college affordability in Dubuque on Friday, followed by the Wing Ding Dinner in Clear Lakes and the all-important Iowa State Fair on Saturday, where Mr. Harkin is expected to campaign with her. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has acknowledged that her more liberal opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, could win Iowa where caucusgoers shunned her in 2008 and she finished third.  In his endorsement, Mr. Harkin, who has retired from the Senate, notes his Iowa roots and the opportunity that has come his way, and praises the rest of the Democratic field, but says Mrs. Clinton can singularly deliver for Iowans. “Now itâs time for a president who can create a stronger future. As Democrats, weâre fortunate to have a slate of candidates that are all fine individuals, but we need a fighter who has a record of getting things done and the vision for the future that will build on the progress weâve made. For my wife, Ruth and I, that candidate is Hillary Clinton.” And he continues to invoke the “fighter” theme in promoting the candidacy of the former first lady, senator and secretary of state. “Hillary and I also both know that while talent is universal, opportunity is not. My brother Frank was deaf, and in school he was told that when he grew up he could be one of just three things: a printer, a cobbler or a baker. Our country has come a long way since that time, but inequality is still lived by kids all across the country, from our inner cities to the small towns of Iowa. Today, too many talented children face limits on their futures. They need a champion in the White House. I know Hillary Clinton will be that champion. It was over a year ago that I said that though I was retiring from the Senate, I would not be retiring from the fight for social and economic justice. That is why today I am proud to endorse my longtime friend and colleague, Hillary Clinton, in her candidacy for president of the United States. I know that she will keep fighting until the opportunities that seemed like an impossibility to a boy from Cumming, Iowa, can be lived by every child in this country.” Amy Chozick contributed reporting.
