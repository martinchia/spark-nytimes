Democrats who have found themselves on the defensive over their support for Planned Parenthood say they believe they can now turn the tables on Republicans after two anti-abortion activists who conducted a sting on the organization were indicted in Texas. House Democrats called on Republicans to disband a special committee investigating the organization in light of the criminal action. Political operatives pounded Republicans on Tuesday over their backing of the activists who filmed the organization undercover and accused staff members of illegally selling fetal tissue. “House Republicans should admit they are wrong and move on,” said one missive from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In separate releases aimed at nearly 20 House Republicans, the campaign committee accused them of jumping to conclusions over Planned Parenthood and rushing to cut funds for the organization, which supporters say is a critical health resource for women. The Republican lawmakers represent districts in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. Republicans were fairly quiet about the indictments issued by a Houston grand jury. But given the strong anti-abortion sentiment among House Republicans, it seems unlikely that they would quickly back down on their investigation of Planned Parenthood or their effort to cut funding for it. The issue has also been a common presence on the campaign trail, with Carly Fiorina making the videos an important component of her stump speeches. The two activists who posed as biomedical workers were accused of tampering with government documents â a felony â and one also faces a misdemeanor charge related to buying human organs. Planned Parenthood was cleared of wrongdoing.
