Married to a woman from Mexico and fluent in Spanish, Jeb Bush shares his Hispanic ties proudly. But he has also seen firsthand the painful side of discrimination. In an interview conducted in Spanish with Telemundo, Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor who is running for president, explained the influence that Hispanic culture has had on his family and opened up about his son’s first brush with racism.  Mr. Bush said that his son, George P. Bush, is “brown-skinned” and that as a child when he traveled from Miami to Ocala to play in a baseball game he was taunted because of it. The episode was upsetting to family members, and a reminder that real racial harmony remains a distant goal. “I had to explain or describe that people who hate are not the majority, and we must accept them and move forward,” Jeb Bush said. Such experiences are why Mr. Bush seeks to strike a softer tone when discussing immigration in a crowded field of Republican rivals who have adopted harsher oratory. The governor said in the interview that language used by Donald J. Trump was especially painful. “I was hurt, hearing somebody speaking in such a vulgar fashion,” Mr. Bush said. “This makes the solving of this problem much more difficult when we have politicians talking like that. We cannot progress.” Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
