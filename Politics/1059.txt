The evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr. endorsed Donald J. Trump for president on Tuesday, giving the Republican candidate another boost in the final days before the Iowa caucuses, in which religious voters usually play a crucial role.  The endorsement had been anticipated for the last several days, especially after Mr. Falwell heaped praise on Mr. Trump when the candidate spoke at his school, Liberty University, in Lynchburg, Va., last week. Mr. Trump’s campaign cut a radio ad featuring those warm words, which the campaign put on the air in Iowa over the weekend.  But as Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz compete aggressively to win the Iowa caucuses in six days, the Texas senator has been relying heavily on a network of pastors to help push him over the finish line. Mr. Falwell’s backing of Mr. Trump is the latest signal from a prominent party figure to Republican voters that the brash New Yorker is acceptable to the religious right.  In a statement released by the campaign, Mr. Trump said, âIt is truly an honor to receive Jerryâs endorsement. Not only is he a high quality person, with a wonderful family, whom I have great respect for â I also consider him a very good friend and his support means so much to me.â  The campaign made clear that the endorsement was personally from Mr. Falwell, since the school is a nonprofit and cannot engage in politics.  Mr. Trump has been reaching out to evangelicals more overtly in recent days, including a visit to a Presbyterian church in Muscatine, Iowa, on Sunday.
