Jeb Bush will disclose the names of his “bundlers,” or volunteer fund-raisers, his campaign said on Wednesday. The announcement, which comes as Mr. Bush and other presidential candidates are preparing to submit detailed financial information to the Federal Election Commission, makes Mr. Bush the first â and so far only â Republican candidate to pledge to disclose his bundlers. “Governor Bush is committed to transparency,” said Kristy Campbell, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush. “We plan to release a list of individuals bundling donations for the campaign for the first two quarters by the time we file our next F.E.C. report.” Bundlers are the financial heart of any presidential campaign, which requires hundreds of volunteer fund-raisers to tap into networks of friends, family and business associates, each of whom can only give $2,700 for any one election. Federal law does not require candidates to disclose the names of bundlers unless they are registered lobbyists. But some major party candidates have done so voluntarily, including President Obama, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and former President George W. Bush, Mr. Bush’s brother. Doing so makes it possible for voters to known who candidates rely on the most to raise money and what industries and interests those people represent. A spokeswoman for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said he would not voluntarily disclose the names of his bundlers. Officials at several other campaigns, including Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin, did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.  Alex Conant, a spokesman for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, said the candidate would not disclose bundlers. “We’ll disclose what the law requires us to, but we don’t discuss our strategy beyond that,” said Mr. Conant.
