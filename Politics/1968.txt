The hip-hop music magnate Russell Simmons endorsed Hillary Clinton for president on Friday, saying she is a practical progressive he trusts while criticizing Senator Bernie Sanders as “overstating what he can deliver to underserved communities.” Mr. Simmons, the business mogul who co-founded the label Def Jam Records and several clothing lines, made the announcement in a series of Twitter posts that praised Mrs. Clinton as a “longtime friend” better able to deliver on her promised policies.
