George W. Bush has been raising money in private for Jeb Bush’s White House campaign for months, but on Tuesday the former president took a small step into a more public role for his younger brother: He sent out a fund-raising email. “I know what it takes to sit in the Oval Office and deal with the issues that come across the president’s desk,” wrote the 43rd president, in what Jeb Bush’s aides said was his second fund-raising solicitation of the campaign. “And I know that Jeb has what it takes to lead our nation.” As part of a last-minute push to bank money ahead of Wednesday night’s quarterly fund-raising deadline, the former president stayed on safe rhetorical terrain, heaping praise on the former Florida governor as “compassionate” and filled with “resolve.” The message was a reminder that the former president is still popular among grass-roots Republicans and can be an asset for his brother in the nominating contest: the former president and his wife, Laura Bush, are also draws among Republican donors and have been headlining events around the country to raise money for the campaign.  The former president is hosting a fund-raising lunch in northwest Arkansas on Friday that is expected to attract many Walmart executives, and he recently added a fund-raising event next month in Denver to his schedule.
