Good Monday morning from Washington, where, though Congress has work to do before its August recess, its members still found time to fight among themselves. Two other deadlines are around the corner as outside fund-raising groups have to file paperwork, and the candidates await word on whether they have been invited to the debates. Toward that end, those on the brink find themselves competing with a surprise front-runner for attention. Less than two weeks before the first Republican presidential debate, candidates are turning up the volume in hopes of getting onstage and keeping up with Donald J. Trump. With qualification for the Aug. 6 debate dependent upon candidatesâ positions in the polls, those who are languishing have been ramping up their attacks and using creative antics to grab attention. Last week, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky looked to ignite his campaign by setting a copy of the tax code on fire. He also attacked it with a wood chipper and a chain saw. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina made the most of his recent dust-up with Mr. Trump, who gave out Mr. Grahamâs cellphone number to the world, starring in a video demonstration of the ways to destroy his flip phone. (Chopping, dropping, toasting and smashing were among them.) So why are the candidates so combustible? âThey are scrambling because of what has happened with Trump jumping into the race and distracting everybody,â said Dean Crutchfield, a brand analyst who likened the tactics to guerrilla marketing strategies that companies use. âThey need to turn the volume up.â Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, has tried to raise his profile by directly engaging with Mr. Trump, calling his candidacy a âcancer on conservatism,â that must be âclearly diagnosed, excised and discarded.” Mike Huckabee turned his attention to President Obama over the weekend, invoking Holocaust imagery to criticize the nuclear deal with Iran. âIt is so naÃ¯ve that he would trust the Iranians,â Mr. Huckabee said on “Breitbart News Saturday.” âBy doing so, he will take the Israelis and march them to the door of the oven.â As the number of polls has increased, candidates like Mr. Graham, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, who cracked the top 10 in a poll released on Sunday, have routinely found themselves on the outside, looking in. Though the lineup is not set, they are nearly out of time to make a splash big enough to register. The run-up to the debate promises to be feisty. â Alan Rappeport Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. Promising more than a half-billion solar panels by the end of a first term and a target of clean energy for every home in a decade, Hillary Rodham Clinton unveiled goals on Sunday evening to reduce the threat of climate change. She will expand on those goals at an event on Monday in Iowa. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will make several appearances in South Carolina, an early voting state that figures prominently in the victory plans of several candidates. And Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will speak about infrastructure needs and policy during an event in New York with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo. Recent train delays along the Northeast Corridor and the stalled highway bill have reignited debates over the age and soundness of the nation’s roads, bridges and tunnels. The Empire struck back on Sunday against young Jedi Ted Cruz, hitting him hard for the breach of Senate decorum he perpetrated when he called Mitch McConnell, his majority leader, a liar on the Senate floor on Friday. But Mr. Cruz, Republican of Texas, and his sidekick, Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, may not be done yet. The rift between Mr. Cruzâs ardent conservatives and the Republican institutionalists shows no sign of abating â an incendiary mix of political ambition and rank-and-file Republican voter anger. âRegrettably, in recent times, the Senate floor has too often become a forum for partisan messaging,â Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, said on Sunday in a broadside against Mr. Cruz. “It has been misused as a tool to advance personal ambitions, a venue to promote political campaigns, and even a vehicle to enhance fund-raising efforts.” âIn a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act,â Mr. Cruz fired back, unrepentant. The question is where he goes from here. Senators Cruz and Lee are trying to upend Senate rules and win simple majority votes on any amendments they want to bring to the Senate. So far, with Republican leaders warning of âchaos,â they have won almost no backing. What they have won is the allegiance of conservative activists pressing for a showdown with Republican leaders. And that is not likely to end â at least as long as Mr. Cruz remains in the presidential race. â Jonathan Weisman Virtually all of the 2016 contenders, and the “super PACs” supporting them, have trumpeted their fund-raising successes of the last few months, announcing figures that are propelling the Republican primary to unheard-of levels of money. But some of the most interesting information will only begin trickling out this week: By midnight Friday, the super PACs, which control most of the money in the race so far, will have to file detailed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission. The filings will disclose two things that are not yet fully known. The first will be who provided all the money to the PACs, which can raise unlimited money from individuals and corporations: the names and occupations of the wealthy Americans putting their money behind the Republican contenders. And the second will be what the PACs did with it. The disclosures will shed new light on how super PACs have moved to the center of the 2016 campaign. Increasingly, super PACs and other organizations are picking up the tab for what used to be “exploratory” expenses, paid for by the candidates using money raised under contribution limits. They are also paying for grass-roots organization, rapid-response, and other tasks that used to be handled by the campaigns. â Nicholas Confessore The story of Mrs. Clintonâs State Department emails has given Republican candidates an opportunity to attack, and while some of them lost no time doing so, others were more restrained. It is an apparent reflection of the thinking of campaign operatives and outside groups who are looking past the Republican primaries toward a general election race against a woman who has often benefited from rivals who have swung too hard. The Senate voted on Sunday to resurrect the federal Export-Import Bank, handing the Republican Partyâs most conservative wing a major defeat and setting up a showdown this week with House leaders divided over the moribund export credit agency. To shift the debate on abortion, Republican politicians have refined how they are talking about pregnancy and abortion rights, choosing their words in a way they hope puts Democrats on the defensive. And, three days after a gunman with a history of mental illness opened fire in a movie theater in Lafayette, La., Mr. Jindal called for other states to toughen their gun laws, telling CBS’s “Face the Nation”: “We need to make sure that background system is working. Absolutely, in this instance, this man never should have been able to buy a gun.â Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was in Louisiana this weekend, where BuzzFeed writes, though he was expected to “feature a significant emphasis on criminal justice,” he “mostly stuck to his bread and butter: economic inequality.” Presidential candidates were well represented on the Sunday news talk shows, as will most likely be the case for the foreseeable future for those who are left out of the debates and are in need of a public platform.Mr. Sanders, who does not have to worry about being excluded from any of the debates, discussed gun rights as he sought to clarify his stand and past moves on the issue. And on “Meet the Press,” The Huffington Post notes, Mr. Kasich broke from Mr. Huckabee and his other Republican candidate counterparts to say that he would not necessarily end the nuclear deal with Iran if he were elected president. The exodus of people from economically besieged Puerto Rico to Florida could help Democrats in the vital swing state, The Washington Post reports. Like the Politics Newsletter?
