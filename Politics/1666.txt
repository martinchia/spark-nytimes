Jeb Bush’s team, which has looked for many of its advisers to pledge fidelity to his all-but-declared campaign, has at least one who is still involved in multiple projects. Mr. Bush, the Republican former governor of Florida, has said he favors eliminating one of  President Obamaâs immigration reform measures through comprehensive reform. But a paid evangelical adviser to Mr. Bush supported a court filing on behalf of members of Congress arguing that the order, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (known as DACA), should be struck down. The adviser, Jordan Sekulow, a lawyer who works with religious conservatives, signed on to the brief filed by the American Center for Law and Justice with the Fifth Circuit Court, arguing that Mr. Obama had overreached his authority. That brief was also signed by the Republican senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, both of whom are running for president. Mr. Cruz has said if elected he would vacate the order. In an interview with Megyn Kelly on Fox News this month, Mr. Bush indicated that he would repeal the DACA program, but would absorb it through broader reform. He has also indicated in other interviews that he believes Mr. Obama went too far with the order, which allows young people who were brought into the country as children to apply for deportation deferrals and work permits. A person close to Mr. Bush said that if he moves forward with the campaign, Mr. Sekulow is expected to wind down his work as chief counsel with the American Center for Law and Justice.
