CHARLESTON, S.C. â The killing of nine people Wednesday at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church hit close to home for many South Carolinians. Count Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican and the stateâs senior senator, among them.  Shortly after learning the news, his younger sister, Darlene, texted him with an unexpected, personal connection â her daughter, and Mr. Grahamâs niece, went to school and grew up riding the bus with the church attack’s suspect, Dylann Storm Roof. âThatâs whatâs so mind-boggling about it â how small South Carolina is,â said Mr. Graham, now a presidential candidate, as he drove around the city on Friday. In a phone interview, Mr. Grahamâs niece, Emillie Boggs, 20, said she was âin shockâ when she learned that the suspect was Mr. Roof, who she sat near in eighth-grade English class. âHe wasnât necessarily antisocial, but he was awkwardly social,â said Ms. Boggs, a senior at the University of South Carolina. âHe was kind of quiet and he only talked when he kind of had to, but he wasnât mean. He was just strange.â Ms. Boggs remembered Mr. Roof as the skinny boy who always wore tight jeans and a black and yellow stripped jacket to class â âlike a bumble bee,â she said â and who often made âdisrespectfulâ comments that would get him in trouble. Some of the boys in her class, she added, thought âhe was just one of those quiet, cool kids,â but the girls largely found him a little bit âweird.â Mr. Roof stood out in her mind as someone who was always a little bit off; one time, she said, she thought he tried to create a petition to get a curse word added to the dictionary. She also said that while he often made âinappropriate comments, just like any other teenage boy,â she had never heard him say anything racist, or negative about the black students at their school. âHe wasnât bullied, he wasnât a bully,â Ms. Boggs said. âHe was the kind of kid youâd expect to have bad behavior in high school, maybe not graduate, but youâd never expect anything like this.â  Follow the New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.
