The campaign finance lawyer for the outside groups supporting Jeb Bush has accused Donald J. Trump of improperly mingling his corporate business with his campaign work and has asked the Federal Election Commission to investigate.  The lawyer, Charles Spies, sent missives to the election commission and to Alan Garten, Mr. Trump’s corporate lawyer. The letters were first reported by Politico.  They were prompted by a cease-and-desist letter that Mr. Garten sent to the Right to Rise PAC, warning against running damaging ads about Mr. Trump. In his reply letter, Mr. Spies mocked Mr. Garten, pointing out that the ads in question had been run by a different group, the Right to Rise âsuper PACâ, not the leadership PAC to which he had sent the letter.  “In light of your confusion over the difference between Leadership PACs and Super PACs, we have to assume you may also be unaware of the F.E.C’s prohibition on a federal candidate’s use of corporate resources for campaign purposes,” Mr. Spies wrote. “Just as your client is attempting to quickly learn the basics of foreign policy, we wish you personally the best in your attempts to learn election law.” Mr. Spies separately asked the F.E.C. to look at the company acting as an agent for the Trump campaign, saying they made what he called an illegal corporate in-kind contribution.  âTrump and his agents have explicitly directed his corporate attorneys at the Organization to do the dirty work for the campaign,” Mr. Spies wrote. He also cited a cease-and-desist letter that Mr. Garten sent to the Club for Growth, the anti-tax group that ran $1 million in ads against Mr. Trump, as another piece of evidence.   A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump’s campaign, Hope Hicks, and Mr. Garten did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
