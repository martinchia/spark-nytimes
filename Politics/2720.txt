MANCHESTER, N.H. â Maybe it was just the end of a long, tiring day of campaigning. Or maybe Senator Marco Rubioâs opponents have gotten into his head. But on Monday, Mr. Rubio, the Florida Republican, who has been under relentless criticism for uttering his talking points over and over in Saturdayâs presidential debate, had another repetitious lapse. Speaking to a crowd in Nashua, he was lamenting the decline in American family values. Then he lamented the decline in American values again. This is what he said verbatim, as his wife and four children looked on: âWe are taking our message to families that are struggling to raise their children in the 21st century because, as you saw, Jeanette and I are raising our four children in the 21st century, and we know how hard itâs become to instill our values in our kids instead of the values they try to ram down our throats. âIn the 21st century, itâs becoming harder than ever to instill in your children the values they teach in our homes and in our church instead of the values that they try to ram down our throats in the movies, in music, in popular culture.” Mr. Rubio appeared to notice his own echo: As he repeated the word âthroats,â he caught himself, but proceeded to the end of his sentence nonetheless.
