Good Tuesday morning from Washington, where President Obama will celebrate his birthday by continuing to press for the nuclear deal with Iran and where pundits, politicians and pollsters are focused on Thursday’s Republican debate. But on Tuesday, we will find out exactly who will be debating. It is decision day for the “decision desk” at Fox News. The network, which is one of the hosts of the first sanctioned Republican presidential debate in Cleveland on Thursday, will announce sometime after 5 p.m. Tuesday which candidates will make the prime-time cut. The remaining candidates will be featured at an earlier forum on Thursday. A few details have dribbled out about the format: 60-second answers, and 30-second rebuttals. Facebook, which is co-host of the debate, will join the questioning every 15 minutes or so. Fox News has not said which five national polls it would use to determine who makes the stage. There was a Fox News poll released on Monday evening, but there have been a range of other surveys. One polling outfit, at Marist College, suspended its polling because it did not want to be part of determining who made the debate stage. But the reality of the sprawling 17-candidate field has posed challenges for all networks hosting debates. Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas are fighting for the final spots, though Mr. Kasich has cracked the Top 10 in several recent polls. Among the only certainties is that Donald J. Trump, who was not at the early-state forum in New Hampshire hosted by C-Span on Monday night, will be on the stage.

Hillary Rodham Clinton will be in Denver, her first 2016 campaign event outside the early voting states, where she will participate, her team says, in “a grass-roots organizing meeting as part of her efforts to work for every vote and take nothing for granted.” On Tuesday, President Obama’s birthday, he and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will meet in the Oval Office with Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general. And Jeb Bush will appear at the Southern Baptist Convention rally as part of his effort to secure the support of evangelicals.   Mr. Obama will meet privately at the White House on Tuesday with about 20 representatives of Jewish groups, his latest bid to confront concern over the nuclear deal with Iran as he works to counter a drive in Congress to reject it. Mr. Obama âwill come preparedâ to argue that the agreement, which lifts some sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program intended to prevent the development of a bomb, âisnât just in the best interests of the United States, itâs clearly within the national security interests of our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel,â Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said. The group, set to meet in the Cabinet Room, will include both opponents and supporters of the deal. But before the meeting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who has called the agreement a âhistoric mistake,â will speak out against it in a webcast organized by the Jewish Federations of North America. The president has been working feverishly to build support for the deal and is scheduled to address the subject on Wednesday at American University in Washington. J Street, a pro-Israel group that is in favor of the accord, will announce on Tuesday a $2 million television advertising campaign in Baltimore, Denver, Detroit, Philadelphia and Portland, Ore., intended to sway wavering lawmakers. The 30-second spot bills the deal as “Good for Israel, Good for America.” — Julie Hirschfeld Davis Mr. Obama unveiled a climate change plan on Monday to sharply limit emissions. The new rules, which he called imperative, include a goal to cut emissions by 32 percent by 2030, and are sure to meet fierce resistance from Republicans and the coal industry. Reports that Mr. Biden was seriously exploring entering the 2016 race reignited discussion among Mrs. Clintonâs advisers about what his potential candidacy would mean for the contest ahead. The comedian Amy Schumer appeared with her cousin, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, to call for increased gun-control measures in the wake of the shooting at a showing of her movie “Trainwreck” at a theater in Louisiana. And Senate Republicans fell several votes shy of the number needed to begin debate on a measure to defund Planned Parenthood. A Wall Street Journal poll finds that unhappy voters are driving the rise of anti-establishment candidates. Mr. Walker stopped by a pizza shop in New Hampshire before Monday’s forum and was met, The Washington Post writes, with a protest stunt, several tough questions from the crowd and “a man with a scraggly beard wearing a black top hat,” a scene less welcoming than those he has encountered in Iowa. And BloombergPolitics argues that Mr. Biden‘s deliberations about whether to run are based on “emotion-laden impulses” in the face of “stark” electoral prospects against Mrs. Clinton. Why won’t Mr. Walker say Mr. Obama is a Christian? The Washington Post suggests he is trying to score points with the Republican base. There’s a crisis in Rick Santorum‘s campaign, with his campaign manager and others leaving amid the candidate’s paltry fund-raising, Politico reports. If his run for president doesnât work out, Mr. Christie is getting plenty of practice as a television personality. As he maintains an aggressive and active campaign schedule, spending most of the past two weeks in Iowa and New Hampshire, heâs also been sure to check in on Fox News and other cable shows with increasing regularity. In the last week alone, Mr. Christie has been on Fox News at least five times, speaking to Sean Hannity, Megyn Kelly, “Fox and Friends,” Bill OâReilly and “Americaâs Newsroom.” He also stopped in at CNN to talk to Jake Tapper and CNBC to share milkshakes with John Harwood. Often affable and extremely comfortable in front of the camera, Mr. Christie has discussed everything from Mr. Obamaâs new environmental regulations to the delicate dance in choosing between Bruce Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi. While he may be a natural on TV, as most politicians are, the aggressive television schedule reflects not punditry ambitions, but rather Mr. Christieâs intense effort to make it onto Thursdayâs debate stage. By keeping his name in the headlines and his face on television, his campaign is staying fresh in the minds of those who will be deciding the debate lineup: nationally polled voters. As of early Tuesday morning, our colleagues at The Upshot have Mr. Christie just squeaking in. — Nick Corasaniti Like the Politics Newsletter? Get it delivered to your inbox.
