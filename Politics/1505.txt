Returning to his political roots as his campaign struggles, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin called on Monday for anti-union measures that, if carried out, would greatly reduce the influence of organized labor in public and private workplaces. At an appearance scheduled for Las Vegas in the afternoon, Mr. Walker plans to call for making it illegal for federal employees to join unions, extend right-to-work policies across the nation and eliminate the federal agency that investigates unfair labor practices.    âTo grow the economy at a higher rate requires a comprehensive approach and reform of the labor unions is a key part of the plan,ââ Mr. Walker plans to say, according to an advance text of his remarks. Mr. Walker shot to national prominence in 2011 by ending most collective bargaining rights of teachers and other public employees in Wisconsin, an effort that drew thousands of protesters to the Capitol, while making Mr. Walker a hero of conservatives nationwide, including big Republican donors like the Koch brothers. This year, he signed a bill making Wisconsin the nationâs 25th right-to-work state, which prevents private-sector unions from requiring workers to pay union dues.    Mr. Walkerâs proposals for what he would do as president amount to the most sweeping curtailment of organized labor since President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the National Labor Relations  Act during the Great Depression, according to labor historians. âHeâs trying to turn the clock back to the 1920s before we had real growth of the labor movement,ââ said Gary Chaison, a professor of labor relations at Clark University in Massachusetts. âHe not only goes after the unionsâ role in collective bargaining, but after the unions as institutions.ââ   Mr. Walkerâs core argument is that unions inhibit economic growth and job creation, and that union leaders â âbig union bosses,ââ in his words â hold too much power over public officials.    Democrats say union membership has been a path to the middle class for millions of Americans. âBy seeking to dismantle unions â the backbone of the middle class that gave us weekends, paid vacations, and child labor laws â Scott Walker is again placing his political ambitions and the demands of his billionaire benefactors ahead of middle-class Americans,ââ a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee said in a statement.  Beyond marching in Labor Day parades and accepting endorsements from union leaders, the leading Democratic presidential candidates, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, have not offered the labor movement policies that would grow unions, labor experts said.  Even if Mr. Walker is not the Republican nominee, labor unions fear his call for national right-to-work legislation.   Mr. Walker especially targets public sector workers, the one area where labor unions have grown recently. He would forbid federal workers from forming unions and give state public employees the right to opt out of paying union fees. The core DNA of Mr. Walker’s presidential campaign is his taking on of unions at home. After leading in some polls of early voting states, his support has plummeted. He registered at 2 percent nationally in an ABC News/Washington Post poll on Monday and was at 3 percent in Iowa in a Quinnipiac Poll last week.  On Friday, Mr. Walker canceled major speeches in California and Michigan, an indication his campaign needs to conserve resources, and redouble its efforts in Iowa and South Carolina, whose conservative Republican voters once embraced him and must again if he is to have a path to the nomination. At an appearance in Iowa on Saturday, Mr. Walker promised to âwreak havoc on Washingtonâ just as he did when first elected governor.
