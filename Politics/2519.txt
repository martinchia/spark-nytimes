Good Thursday morning. The debate over the Iran nuclear deal in Congress and among the candidates continues to pull focus onto the national stage. But a major character still waits in the wings as speculation will attach itself to his every move until he decides whether to stay out of view or to step into the campaign lights. On Thursday, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is considering a presidential campaign, will spend a full day in New York, Hillary Rodham Clintonâs home base, raising money for Democrats and appearing with local officials. Those officials include Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who is supporting Mrs. Clinton. But Mr. Cuomoâs political aides sent an email urging people to come to a rally that heâll hold with Mr. Biden in support of raising the federal minimum wage. Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, and Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, who until recently was the top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, will also meet with Mr. Biden to discuss the backlog of evidence kits in sexual assault cases, which hinders prosecutions and is an important issue for many women. Mr. Biden has identified with both issues — workersâ rights and ending violence against women — throughout his career; they are also of premium importance to the Democratic base. Later, he will appear on âThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,â an eagerly anticipated appearance in a setting that is likely to suit Mr. Biden. And heâll raise money for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee at an event hosted by James Torrey, a longtime bundler for President Obama, and by Gary Hindes, a friend of Mr. Bidenâs for four decades. As with most of Mr. Bidenâs recent appearances, the temptation will be to read his schedule like tea leaves for hints of his 2016 plans. But as has been the case throughout, it is difficult to predict the future of a man enduring unimaginable personal grief after the death of a son. —Â Maggie Haberman What We’re Watching â Â President ObamaÂ will meet in the morning with Gold Star Mothers, a group of women whose children died while in the armed services, to discuss the Iran nuclear deal. Later in the day, he andÂ Michelle ObamaÂ will award theÂ 2014 National Medal of Arts to the novelistÂ Stephen King, the actressÂ Sally FieldÂ and other artists and performers. â Â The campaign trail is relatively quiet: Jeb BushÂ will hold a town-hall-style event in New Hampshire, andÂ Mrs. ClintonÂ will make appearances with womenâs groups in Wisconsin and Ohio. Going Against Grain, Paul Plans to Start Planned Parenthood Fight Speaker John A. BoehnerÂ desperately wants to avoid it. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has said no way. But some Republican members of Congress â who also happen to be running for presidentÂ â have other plans for a fight over funding Planned Parenthood. AndÂ on Thursday,Â Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is seeking the Republican nomination, will push to bring that fight to the Capitol right away. At noon, Mr. Paul plans to headline a rally of anti-abortion activists who are calling on Congress to cut off Planned Parenthoodâs federal financing in the wake of videos accusing the organization of illegally selling fetal tissue for a profit, which the group denies. The rally will take place â where else â on the Capitol’s lawn. The issue is particularly tense because the question of appropriating money to the organization has become entangled in the debate over the budget, which has to be dealt with before the government runs out of spending authority onÂ Sept. 30. For senators like Mr. Paul andÂ Ted Cruz of Texas, their hard-line opposition to Planned Parenthood funding is likely to bring them into conflict with Mr. McConnell, who strongly believes the Republican Party cannot afford the harm to its reputation from another shutdown. But the debate could be especially rough for Mr. Paul and Mr. McConnell, who have rebuilt and cultivated their relationship despite getting off to a bad start in their home state, Kentucky, when Mr. McConnell supported Mr. Paul’s primary opponent. That raises the question: Will Mr. McConnell come to regret giving his blessing to Mr. PaulâsÂ successful bidÂ to change the electoral process in Kentucky so that he could run for president and re-election to his Senate seat at the same time? â Jeremy W. Peters A Court Ruling Brings a Cheer for Boehner, if Not Quite Three Under pressure from conservatives in his ranks on multiple fronts,Â Mr. BoehnerÂ was in need of a victory and, on Wednesday, he got one. The rulingÂ byÂ Judge Rosemary M. CollyerÂ of United States District Court that House Republicans could go forward with their lawsuit against the Obama administration over health care spending was at least an initial validation of Mr. Boehnerâs strategy against the White House. Mr. Boehner has battled critics in his own party who have complained that he is not aggressive enough in challenging Mr. Obama. They are now unhappy with his handling of the Iran deal and, of course, Planned Parenthood. Like Mr. McConnell, Mr. Boehner has argued that there are more effective strategies than government shutdowns and votes that go nowhere. He can now wave the court ruling as evidence that his approach can produce actual results. At least some of his troops seem to agree. When Mr. Boehner announced the lawsuit ruling at a special meeting of House Republicans on the Iran deal on Wednesday afternoon, there was a loud cheer. â Carl Hulse Our Favorites from the Times âÂ Mr. Bush released a tax plan that would eliminate some tax brackets and curtail the deductions and the âcarried interestâ tax loophole that have enriched investment managers. âÂ The Democratic officials who have expressed concern about Mrs. Clinton have compiled a Plan B list of some big names. âÂ And Mrs. Clinton backed the Iran nuclear deal in a speech in Washington. Along with saying that the United States should take the lead in dealing with the migrant crisis in Europe, she called for tougher enforcement measures in the deal. What We’re Reading Elsewhere âÂ  The Los Angeles TimesÂ writesÂ thatÂ Ben Carson‘sÂ appeal to conservative voters âlooking for outsider presidential candidates without the bombast ofÂ Donald Trumpâ is based on Mr. Carsonâs âChristian faith, his outsider status and his medical background.â Separately, Mr. CarsonÂ seemed to questionÂ Mr. Trump’s faith on Wednesday, CNN writes. âÂ  NPRÂ reportsÂ that a conservative Latino group âfunded by the Koch brothersâ wrote a letter to Republican candidates âvoicing its frustration with Republican immigration rhetoric on the campaign trail.â âÂ  And Paul Solotaroff of Rolling Stone spent some time with Mr. Trump, and wrote: âOver the course of 10 days and several close-in encounters, I got to peer behind the scrim of his bluster and self-mythos and get a very good look at the man. What I saw was enough to make me take him dead serious.â Cruz, Trump and Even Captain America Brave Heat at Iran Rally The lawn in front of Mr. Cruz was littered with American flags and signs, costumed Tea Party activists and a former Marine dressed as Captain America. But pushed to the outskirts of the West Lawn, where Mr. Cruz, Mr. Trump and other conservative voices were leading a rally against the Iran deal, a ring of people sought shelter not from the crowds but from the sun. Such are the risks of staging an event in early September in Washington, where 90-degree heat is compounded by humidity to remind everyone theyâre standing in a swamp. The heat can also keep people away, perhaps explaining why the crowd facing Mr. Trump was slightly smaller than heâs used to. Not absent, however, were the many, many reporters and cameras that follow Mr. Trump wherever he goes. Before he even spoke, he found himself at the center of a swarm eight or nine people deep. âEverywhere Donald goes, he brings 100 television cameras,â Mr. Cruz told reporters after both candidatesâ speeches. âDonald Trumpâs being here ensured the mainstream media would cover this event. And it is my hope that the coverage will include the catastrophic national security consequence of this deal.â â Nick Corasaniti
