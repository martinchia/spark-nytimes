Good Tuesday morning from Washington, where Congress returns from its Fourth of July holiday to find education bills, highway funding and potential Iran nuclear deals waiting for it. But as the activity on the trail slows a little, Hillary Rodham Clinton seems ready to enter another stage of her campaign. Mrs. Clinton is about to give her first national close-up in her second presidential campaign. She has been a candidate for almost three months. In that time, she’s done a few news conferences and a smattering of local interviews in early states, but no national sit-downs. But this afternoon, she will sit with the CNN reporter Brianna Keilar in Iowa. The interview comes as Mrs. Clinton has faced increasing criticism for avoiding questions on policy (the trade deal supported by President Obama but opposed by many Democrats) and on personal issues (her use of a private email account at the State Department and the fund-raising practices of her family’s foundation). Mrs. Clinton’s aides said that her early focus was on interacting with as many voters as possible in small settings and that this national interview would be the first of several. Much of the early campaign was about allowing Mrs. Clinton to exist in a safe political space, bringing one of the world’s most famous political faces back down to earth from her days as secretary of state so that voters could forge a bond with her. But over the weekend, a half-dozen protesters created an unpredictable environment for Mrs. Clinton as she marched in a parade in northern New Hampshire. At the same time, her aides sought to give her a buffer so that voters could see her, separating journalists with a rope, creating a series of viral photos that ricocheted through Twitter. The challenges that the Clinton campaign, and the candidate, face are unique. But while her political problems may be complex, the solution that her team seems to have settled on, at this point, is fairly simple: Open the doors to the news media a bit wider. â  Maggie Haberman Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. In the evening, Mr. Obama will meet with Senate Democrats at the White House, where the Iran nuclear deal and the July agenda are likely topics. On the campaign trail, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana are in New Hampshire for several events, including a popular campaign stop at a pints and politics appearance for Mr. Jindal. Mrs. Clinton and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida are in Iowa. And Illinois will vote in a special election to replace Representative Aaron Schock, who resigned in March amid intense scrutiny over renovation costs for his opulent office in Washington. State Senator Darin LaHood, a Republican and the son of Ray LaHood, the transportation secretary until 2013 under Mr. Obama, is considered a favorite in the race of three Republicans and two Democrats.  The House and the Senate return on Tuesday for a monthlong push to the August summer recess, with the possibility of a nuclear deal with Iran and the need to renew the federal highway program hanging over the coming weeks. Both chambers will begin the month considering education measures, and conservative activists are already urging Republicans to scuttle a bipartisan overhaul of the No Child Left Behind Act scheduled to be on the Senate floor. The House is also set to take up some spending bills while the money debate is stalled in the Senate, where Democrats are threatening to block any appropriations measures until Republicans agree to new budget talks. If the United States and Iran agree to limits on Iran’s nuclear abilities in exchange for eased economic sanctions, Congress would have 30 days to review that understanding, and it would immediately take center stage on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers must also find a way to keep federal highway projects going after July 31. Senators are more inclined to push a long-term solution if they can find a way to pay for it while the House leans toward another short-term fix. The highway measure is also tied up in efforts to renew the expired charter of the Export-Import Bank, an effort that has much more support in the Senate than in the House. â Carl Hulse First, it was a meeting with President RaÃºl Castro of Cuba. Now, itâs an Oval Office sit-down with the head of Vietnamâs Communist Party. Mr. Obama, who has made his willingness to talk to longtime adversaries in pursuit of diplomatic breakthroughs a hallmark of his foreign policy, will press forward with that approach on Tuesday at the White House when he welcomes the party’s general secretary, Nguyen Phu Trong. The meeting comes four decades after the fall of Saigon and marks the 20th anniversary of normalized relations between the United States and Vietnam. It also underscores the extraordinary pace and depth of the reconciliation between two former enemies that have been linked in recent years by a mutual concern about a rising China and the emergence of a sweeping trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that both countries see as vital to their economic and security interests. Mr. Obama and Mr. Trong âwill discuss how we can further advance our cooperation,â said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, calling the meeting âhistoric.â The visit comes just days after Mr. Obama announced he was to formally resume diplomatic relations with Cuba, another onetime adversary whose Communist leaders the United States had long relegated to pariah status. The move has incited outrage among many Republicans and Cuban-American lawmakers who argue that Mr. Obama is appeasing a dictator, but he has countered that the best way to address concerns with the regime is through engagement. The White House suggested the meeting with Mr. Trong was no different. â Julie Hirschfeld Davis The ample crowds and unexpectedly strong showing garnered by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont are setting off worry among Mrs. Clinton‘s advisers and allies, who believe he could overtake her in Iowa polls by the fall and even defeat her in the nationâs first nominating contest there. A tax-exempt group formed by allies of Mr. Rubio said on Monday that it was preparing to spend upward of $20 million on issue advertising, money whose source the organization is not required to disclose.The announcement suggests that Mr. Rubio is the biggest beneficiary so far of a largely untested means for moving unlimited cash into presidential primary campaigns: utilizing nonprofit groups that work alongside “super PACs,” but that are not required to disclose who is providing the money they raise. And as Mr. Obama awaits news on the Iran deal, he is keeping his schedule relatively bare. Just in case. Mr. Jindal wrote on Twitter on Monday that to imagine what a Clinton or a Sanders presidency would look like, one would only need to “look at what’s happening in Greece today.” Politico takes a look. Republican donors, The Associated Press reports, have become alarmed at the party infighting over Donald J. Trump‘s comments about immigrants from Mexico, and have called for an end to “Republican on Republican violence.” And BuzzFeed found footage from a Las Vegas comedian who brought Mike Huckabee on stage during a show in 2010, gave him a mask, dressed him as Cher, and joined him in a duet of “I Got You Babe.” Mr. Sanders‘s rise in polls threatens to tar the Democratic Party among moderates because of his association with socialism, Politico reports. Mr. Obamaâs decision to sing âAmazing Graceâ at the end of his eulogy for the black pastor who was killed with eight others in Charleston, S.C., last month, became one of the more memorable moments of his second term. But the idea raised at least some eyebrows when he broached it with his closest confidantes. Mr. Obama was on the Marine One helicopter leaving the White House en route to Andrews Air Force Base for his flight to South Carolina when he mentioned the thought to his wife, Michelle Obama, and Valerie Jarrett, the couple’s close friend and a White House senior adviser. âWhen I get to the second part of referring to âAmazing Grace,â I think I might sing,â he told them, by Ms. Jarrettâs account. âHmm,â Ms. Jarrett recalled responding. Mrs. Obama was a little more pointed. âWhy on earth would that fit in?â she asked. He tried to explain. âI donât know whether Iâm going to do it,â he said, according to Ms. Jarrett, âbut I just wanted to warn you two that I might sing.â Ms. Jarrett told the story at the Aspen Ideas Festival last week. She noted that she had a little history with Mr. Obamaâs singing career, recalling the 2012 fund-raiser at the Apollo Theater in Harlem when he crooned a little Al Green to a cheering crowd despite her warning, âPlease, whatever you do, donât sing.â So this time, she said, she knew better than to object. Many who watched him that day noted that he paused a long time before beginning to sing. âSo later I said to him, âWere you thinking about whether or not to sing?â â Ms. Jarrett recalled at Aspen. âHe said: âOh, no, I knew I was going to sing. I was just trying to figure out which key to sing it.â â â Peter Baker Like the Politics Newsletter? Get it delivered to your inbox.
