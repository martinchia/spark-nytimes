Take a glance at President Obamaâs public schedule for the next few days, and it may appear the leader of the free world is indulging in a week of summer vacation.  Mr. Obamaâs daybook is clear as far as the eye can see, save for a briefing Monday afternoon with military commanders at the Pentagon and a meeting on Tuesday with the head of Vietnamâs Communist Party.  Behind the scenes, though, the blank agenda is a sign of a White House on standby, as the president and his team await news from Vienna on whether the secretary of State, John Kerry, and negotiators from around the globe can strike a deal with Iran to restrain its nuclear program. By keeping Mr. Obama free, White House officials maximize their ability to move quickly to schedule a last-minute news conference or public statement by the president announcing a long-sought accord. The president’s schedule, said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, âhas been left intentionally fluid to account for the fact that we may have news out of Vienna,â where Mr. Kerry is in marathon talks to try to cement a deal before a Tuesday deadline, or by Thursday, after which a congressional review period would double, to 60 days from 30 days. For now, the atmosphere at the White House is one of bated breath, with many officials bracing for a negotiating deadline that has already slipped twice this year to be blown once again. âItâs certainly possible,â Mr. Earnest told reporters on Monday. âI donât have an expectation to share.â A major breakthrough that would shape the presidentâs foreign policy legacy and trigger a sharp debate in Congress is a distinct possibility, but until an agreement is struck or collapses, there is some foot-tapping and watch-checking underway. âWeâll just have to see how the week takes shape,â Mr. Earnest said.
