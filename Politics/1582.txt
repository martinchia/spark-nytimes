Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is going on tour to promote his new book this week and one prominent reader is not so happy: Karl Rove. Mr. Rove, the veteran Republican strategist and former adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote a lengthy rebuttal to a section of Mr. Cruz’s book, “A Time For Truth,” disputing a 2009 conversation that the senator recounts. Although the book will not be released until Tuesday, excerpts detail an angry call that Mr. Rove made to Mr. Cruz over his solicitation of support from former President George H. W. Bush in his campaign to become Texas’s attorney general. Mr. Cruz claims that Mr. Rove bullied him into downplaying the endorsement and suggested that Mr. Bush was too old to make such decisions. According to Mr. Rove’s recollection, detailed in a post on Medium, Mr. Cruz put the elder Mr. Bush in the potentially awkward position of being asked to support the opponent of a candidate, Greg Abbott, who his son had appointed to the Texas Supreme Court. “My call to Mr. Cruz apparently didnât offend him back then because he continued seeking my counsel about his political ambitions, specifically his 2012 bid for the U.S. Senate,” Mr. Rove wrote. “One piece of advice I offered was that he should stop describing himself as the ânext Marco Rubio,â since he did not have Senator Rubioâs outstanding legislative record of accomplishments as speaker of the Florida House of Representatives.” Mr. Rove also disputed the idea that he would have questioned the faculties of the 41st president. “I am accustomed to being criticized for othersâ political benefit, but am disappointed in how Senator Cruz decided to raise the name of one of the finest presidents our country has ever known, President George H.W. Bush,” he said. Mr. Cruz hit back at Mr. Rove on Sunday evening, releasing an email exchange that the two had at the time in which Mr. Rove asked him to keep a low profile about Mr. Bush’s donation to his campaignÂ out of concern that it would complicate fund-raising for the Bush presidential library. The dust-up comes as Mr. Cruz is looking to raise his profile in an increasingly crowded Republican field of presidential candidates and burnish his reputation as someone who will stand up to his party’s establishment power-brokers. âI understood that my recounting in my book A Time for Truth the threats he made in the 2009 Texas Attorney General race â and the disparaging remarks he made about President George H.W. Bush â would cause him some discomfort,” Mr. Cruz said in a statement. “But I never imagined that his response would be a straight-out falsehood.”
