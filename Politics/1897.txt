Summer might be over, but the summer of Hillary Rodham Clintonâs discontent continued on the Sunday talk shows, as the political class continued to chew on the challenges facing her candidacy — including the continuing investigation into her private email, the rise of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in Iowa and New Hampshire, and the potential threat of a candidacy from Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.  Mr. Sanders, whose campaign has been almost entirely focused on economic issues, stopped by NBC News’s “Meet the Press” to show off his foreign policy chops. Looking ahead to the second Republican presidential debate on Wednesday, candidates and pundits pontificated about a divided party swept up in the anti-establishment charisma of Donald J. Trump and the quiet religiousness of Ben Carson, who has climbed in the polls lately and on Sunday coolly defended himself against Mr. Trumpâs claim that he lacked energy. Ben Carson âI am not specifically going after Trump supporters. I am going after everyone in America,â Mr. Carson said on ABC Newsâs “This Week.” âIf we donât begin to change our direction and change our attitude, I think we may not survive into the future.â He said his comments questioning Mr. Trumpâs faith were not meant as an insult, though he said, âit was certainly spun that way by the media because they enjoy creating a fight.â In response to Mr. Trumpâs comments that he lacked energy (which Mr. Trump has also said of Jeb Bush), an almost eerily measured Mr. Carson replied, âIt doesnât bother me because I recognize I have plenty of energy, operating on people for 10, 12, sometimes 20 hours at a time. You donât have to be loud to be energetic.â  Senator Bernie Sanders Mr. Sandersâs message about income inequality and taking on Wall Street has resonated with Democratic voters, but as Chuck Todd of NBC News pointed out on Sunday, his foreign policy positions are not widely known. Asked about how many Syrian refugees the United States should shelter, Mr. Sanders declined to say. âItâs impossible to give a proper number until we understand the dimensions of the problem,â he said. (That differs from the position of former Gov. Martin OâMalley of Maryland, who is also seeking the Democratic nomination and last week called on the United States to accept at least 65,000 refugees fleeing Syria and Iraq.) Mr. Sanders reminded Mr. Todd that he voted against authorizing military force in Iraq in 2002 â which Mrs. Clinton has said she regretted supporting. âWhat I feared would happen, in fact, did happen: mass destabilization in the region,â he said. But Mr. Sanders did not present himself as the antiwar candidate and said he was not against the use of force in all circumstances. He voted to authorize the war in Afghanistan. âI believed that Osama bin Laden needed to be captured, needed to be brought to trial,â Mr. Sanders said.  Gov. Chris Christie  Mr. Christie, the New Jersey governor, whose presidential prospects have dimmed amid political scandals in his home state, took a jab at Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, who previously worked for Mrs. Clinton but has yet to endorse his former boss.  âWhen I sat and watched Bill de Blasio the other day talk about how it’s safer in New York City,â Mr. Christie said on NBC News, âit’s ironic that the only person who thinks it is safer in New York City are guys who are walking around with armed guards all the time.â Gov. John Kasich Mr. Kasich, the Ohio governor and a relative latecomer to the Republican field, attempted to prove his conservative credentials. âI would build the wallâ on the Mexican border, he told Fox News. âIâd make it clear that anybody who tries to make it over that wall: âNo more excuses, youâre going back.â â When asked about his previous comments about an increase to the federal minimum wage and whether he supported what President Obama and other Democrats have pushed for, Mr. Kasich pushed back. âI fundamentally believe it ought to be done at the state level,â he said. âThatâs what I believe.â Donald J. Trump In a preview of the tactics he might bring to the Republican debate on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump, speaking on CBS News’s “Face the Nation,” criticized Carly Fiorina’s business record and said his widely-criticized comments about her face had been taken out of context. “I was talking about her persona,” Mr. Trump said. “She had tremendously, you could call it bad luck, you could call it she did a bad job, but Hewlett-Packard was a disaster. And Lucent, the company she was at before Hewlett-Packard, was a disaster.” Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in spirit Across all the Sunday news programs, pundits picked apart whether Mr. Biden would enter the Democratic contest and discussed his searing interview with Stephen Colbert on âThe Late Showâ last week, when he discussed, with agonizing grief in his voice, the death of his 46-year-old son, Beau Biden. Mrs. Clintonâs supporters have publicly said that Mr. Bidenâs entry could help her emerge from the Democratic race battle tested. But Ron Fournier of National Journal wasnât buying it. When asked on “Meet the Press” whether Mr. Biden would help Mrs. Clinton, he said, simply, âNo.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
