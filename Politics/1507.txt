As if there were not enough visitors to Iowa these days, the first caucus state will host on Monday the one person who knows for a fact he won’t be living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue come the end of January 2017. President Obama will take a bus tour in Iowa aimed not at securing caucus votes for himself but at promoting his education bona fides. If it happens to generate interest on the part of Democratic voters for Democratic candidates, so much the better. Mr. Obama will join a bus tour conducted by his education secretary, Arne Duncan, before heading to North High School in Des Moines for a town-hall-style meeting where he will discuss ways to make college better and more affordable. Over the weekend, he announced the creation of a new college scorecard to help students and their parents pick the right school â but not rating each school as originally envisioned â and also announced his intention to make it possible for students to apply for financial aid in October rather than wait until January. After all, in January, young people in Iowa may be busy with other things.
