Hillary Rodham Clinton on Friday unveiled the next prong of her plan to raise taxes on the wealthy and use the increased revenue to help undergraduates pay for college and ease the $1.2 trillion in debt they collectively face.  The plan, which she introduced in New Hampshire on Monday, would cost $350 billion over the next decade and include refinancing options for students who have graduated with debt. While in Dubuque, Iowa, on Friday, she talked about easing the financial burden on working parents trying to get their undergraduate degrees. “I want to help these young people get their education so that they and their children will have a better life,” Mrs. Clinton said.  Mrs. Clinton proposed giving such parents better access to child care by increasing spending on the Child Care Access Means Parents in School Program, which provides grants for campus-based childcare centers, to $250 million from $15 million. The plan, based on a program she founded in 1990 as the first lady of Arkansas, would also give $1,500 yearly scholarships to as many as 1 million parents enrolled in undergraduate colleges and universities and who maintain at least a 2.5-grade-point average. “We have to make a quality education affordable and available without saddling young people with decades of debt,” Mrs. Clinton said.  Mrs. Clintonâs higher education plans have drawn criticism from both sides of the political aisle. Liberals argue it does not go as far as plans by two of her Democratic rivals, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin OâMalley of Maryland, in helping eliminate the debt load faced by students at public universities. Republicans promptly labeled the plan typical tax-and-spend liberalism that wonât help the problem. âObamacare for college,â was how one presidential candidate, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, put it. After the town-hall-style meeting in Dubuque, Mrs. Clinton planned a short flight to Clear Lakes where she was scheduled to address the Wing Ding Dinner, an annual  fund-raiser and a must-stop for Democratic presidential hopefuls. Mr. Sanders and Mr. O’Malley were also scheduled to speak.
