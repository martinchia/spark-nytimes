Good Monday morning from Washington. The Republican candidates have a busy week lined up, and the Iowa caucuses have added some technology to their traditions. But the week begins with President Obama in Europe, a Bush heading there and the politics of foreign affairs taking a step into the spotlight.  Foreign policy, which has factored heavily in Republican stump speeches so far, will be center stage this week from Europe to the campaigns. Mr. Obama is in Germany on Monday for the Group of 7 summit meeting, where he will meet with German officials and representatives from Canada, France, Italy and Japan, to discuss maintaining the economic sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine. Mr. Obama will also meet with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq, to discuss terrorism and the growing threat of the Islamic State. Then on Tuesday, Jeb Bush, the brother and the son of former presidents, will visit Berlin, in his first major overseas trip as an all-but-declared presidential candidate. For Mr. Bush, it has been a difficult couple of months over foreign policy, as he conceded privately that the rollout of a large list of foreign policy advisers had been botched and as he seemed loath to criticize George W. Bushâs decision to invade Iraq. His Europe trip is a chance to reset ahead of his anticipated campaign kickoff rally on June 15. But it also highlights how foreign policy has dominated the Republican side of the discussion, while Democrats have focused on domestic issues. Hillary Rodham Clinton has said little about foreign affairs, focusing instead on sweeping proposals like policing overhaul, voting rights and expanding Mr. Obamaâs executive actions on immigration rights. As Ross Douthat wrote on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton has deprived critics on the left of oxygen as sheâs assumed positions popular among the general electorate. It also means that, on foreign policy, Mrs. Clinton is leaving the most ground for Republicans to draw a clear contrast with her and to tether her to Mr. Obama.

Mr. Obama will hold a news conference on Monday from the Group of 7 meetings. The Republicans will hold another group gathering from Thursday through the weekend: Mitt Romney‘s summit meeting in Utah, where Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, among others, are expected to vie for prospective donors.Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky will speak at the Baltimore County Lincoln Reagan Dinner in Maryland on Tuesday; Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive, is in New Hampshire for most of the week; and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey will be in Washington, D.C., and in Iowa. And as for the Democrats, Mrs. Clinton will hold fund-raisers in New York ahead of her formal, and large, campaign kickoff rally on Roosevelt Island on Saturday, while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will be in Iowa later in the week, and former Gov. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island will be in New York and in New Hampshire. The Iowa caucuses are a process heavy with tradition. Paper ballots are counted by hand, while voters gather in a room and try to persuade others to support their candidate. This year, the caucuses are going high-tech, at least in how they tally votes. While the voting process will remain the same, the results will now be reported via a custom app made in partnership with Microsoft. Officials at each precinct will be able to tally and report their results with the app, making the process more efficient and accurate. Previously, officials had to call in a number and use a touch-tone phone to report results, which sometimes led to erroneous reporting from clumsy fingers. âIt wasnât speed; itâs more the accuracy,â said Charlie Szold, the communications director for the Republican Party of Iowa, when explaining the change. âPeople will be able to see the data that theyâre inputting. It sounds like a small change, but itâs a huge difference.â The decision was made in conjunction with the state Democratic Party, and while speed may not have been a deciding factor, the real-time counting of the results will allow the news media to get faster results and alert officials more quickly to potential problems. Any online reporting carries the risk of a cyberattack, of course, which is why the state chose Microsoft, Mr. Szold said. âThey have a long history of secure apps and secure business programs,â he said. And should anything go horribly wrong, the phone lines will still be up if anyone needs to make a call. — Nick Corasaniti How Mrs. Clinton campaigns and, should she win, how she may govern is very much on the minds of Democratic senators from red states. That is partly a result of their own self-interest: Five Democratic senators from states Mr. Obama lost at least once â Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Jon Tester of Montana, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Claire McCaskill of Missouri â are all up for re-election in 2018. Yes, that would be Mrs. Clinton’s first midterm election. — Jonathan Martin Appearing on the Sunday talk shows, Mr. Graham and Mr. Walker showed that though foreign policy had been the driving focus of the early campaign, Republicans were beginning to try to distinguish themselves on domestic and social issues as well. The adjustments to the electoral map made by Mrs. Clinton‘s team have gotten the attention of a superdelegate who supported Mr. Obama in 2008. Will the House Republican leadership pull the trigger on the fast-track trade-negotiating bill this week? That’s the big question on Capitol Hill as backers of new trade deals seem to be closing in on the magic number to put the legislation over the top. The original schedule had the trade bill being on the floor at some point this week. But Republican leaders didn’t lock it in as they continued to press for support in what will be a very close vote. Timing is tricky in these situations, and House leaders need to go at precisely the right moment. Move too soon and they risk a humiliating defeat and the loss of momentum; wait too long and labor and environmental opponents could peel away support, or some sudden development could cause trouble. Whether or not the bill is on the floor this week, Speaker John A. Boehner made clear last week that June was the make-or-break month, saying he didn’t see much point in extending the fight into July if trade advocates didn’t yet have the votes. — Carl Hulse Mr. Chafee‘s suggestion last week that switching to the metric system would be part of his economic policy, a suggestion that raised more than a few eyebrows, “actually makes a lot of sense,” The Huffington Post argues. The Washington Post writes how Mrs. Clinton’s campaign is generating a new breed of female fund-raisers. Mr. Graham‘s comments on Sunday about climate change and other issues are, Politico writes, just the latest examples of “how the South Carolina Republican breaks with many other conservatives seeking the G.O.P. presidential nomination.” John Dickerson at CBS News breaks down “the politics of voting rights, fraud or freedom?” The issue re-entered the conversation last week after Mrs. Clinton criticized several Republicans for their efforts to require ID’s at the polls and other voting measures. If early events are any indication, craft breweries are among the locations du jour this election cycle. So far, Mr. Bush visited Four Peaks Brewery in Arizona, and Mrs. Clinton swung by Smuttynose in New Hampshire. Bob Pease, the chief executive of the Brewers Association, is particularly pleased. âI think you always get a better turnout at a brewery,â Mr. Pease said with a laugh, while talking to First Draft at his groupâs marquee event, Savor, in Washington this weekend. While he has no preferred candidate yet, he can recommend some drinking spots in the three early voting states: Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. In Iowa, he recommends Peace Tree, in Knoxville, about an hourâs drive from Des Moines. The brewery began in 2009 in a former Nash Rambler car dealership and has grown to sell its beer across Iowa, and parts of Nebraska and Minnesota. In South Carolina, Mr. Pease recommends Coast Brewing Company in Charleston, just off the old Navy base. And in New Hampshire, Mr. Pease believes Ms. Clinton has already visited the best brewery for political events in the Granite State at Smuttynose. For Mr. Pease, it is a no-brainer for candidates to make breweries, which have become âa community hub,â he said, a part of the campaign. âEverybody likes to go to a brewery,â he said. âThereâs not a better place.â  — Nick Corasaniti Like the Politics Newsletter?
