The opening phase of Hillary Rodham Clintonâs presidential campaign, with its sporadic and somewhat sheltered schedule of small round-table discussions, is coming to a close, her aides said Thursday. Beginning with a June 13 rally where she plans to lay out a more detailed rationale for her candidacy, Mrs. Clinton is expected to begin detailing policy proposals, interacting with larger groups of voters at town  hall settings and speaking to even bigger crowds of Democrats, mainly in the early nominating states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, the aides said. Though her aides described the June kick-off event as a pivot into a new phase of the campaign, they said she still remained focused exclusively on winning the Democratic primary, and on raising the $100 million they say she will need to do so. The aides, who briefed reporters at Mrs. Clintonâs Brooklyn campaign headquarters, insisted on anonymity, but refused to say which of Mrs. Clintonâs rivals, Democratic or Republican, she considered a threat, and gave few specifics about the June 13 rally other than to reveal that Bill and Chelsea Clinton, who have not campaigned with her yet, would both attend. And they provided little else in the way of candor, other than to acknowledge that Mrs. Clinton, who performs better when she is not overscheduled, would still have a long way to go to ramp up to a full-blown general election-style pace.
