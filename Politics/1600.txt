ATLANTA â Georgia may not be one of the all-important first four states to vote in the 2016 presidential nominating process starting in February, but Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican candidate, made a quick pit stop here on Wednesday night to say he’ll compete hard in the March 1 primaries in the state and several others. Speaking at a campaign fund-raiser before about 100 people at the Buckhead Club, Mr. Walker â who spent the day on a three-city swing through South Carolina â said the March 1 primaries through much of the South would be key to his chances of winning the nomination. “We didn’t just come here by accident,” Mr. Walker said. “With March 1 being not long after those first four states, we think that the March 1 primaries â the S.E.C. primaries, if you will â are going to be incredibly important, and we feel we can do well.” “Georgia’s going to make a difference,” he added, “so get used to seeing us.” Advisers say that the March 1 states of Alabama, Minnesota, Tennessee and Virginia are also shaping up well for Mr. Walker, based on endorsements and grass-roots voter support that they are seeing so
far. Mr. Walker is focused on winning the first state to hold a nominating contest, Iowa on Feb. 1, and hopes to leave there with momentum to help him in the next states: New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. He hasn’t been campaigning much in New Hampshire, to the consternation of some Republican admirers; after the Atlanta fund-raiser he caught a flight to New Hampshire, where he is doing two meet-and-greet events on Thursday. He’ll hold a fund-raiser in Boston on Thursday night before moving on to Iowa for three days of campaigning.
