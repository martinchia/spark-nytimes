MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. — Speaking just six miles apart on Friday morning, Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas renewed their bitter personal feud, while their supporters echoed the candidates’ language and themes â a sign that the bitterness between the two men has now seeped deeply into the feelings of voters.       Mr. Trump called Mr. Cruz âthe biggest liar Iâve ever seen,” a line he has been pushing all week. Trump supporters, some of whom said they had once considered supporting the Texas senator, largely agreed with Mr. Trumpâs harsh assessment. âIâm very disappointed in Ted Cruz because of the way heâs going after other opponents, and some of the things I donât think were actually fair,” said Ken Ivey, a retired contractor who waited in line to hear Mr. Trump.   Earlier in the day, Mr. Cruz mocked Mr. Trumpâs vague generalities. âItâs easy to say âmake America great again,â ” he told supporters in a room overlooking the ocean. âDo you understand what made America great in the first place?â An attendee, Mike Loebs, echoed his candidate, complaining of Mr. Trump, âHeâs all yadda yadda yadda.” âHe has nothing specific,” added Mr. Loebs, who retired after 30 years in the Navy. âI think heâs a bully. If you donât agree with him, youâre fat, dumb or ugly.”  âTrump is a complete disaster,” said another Cruz supporter, John Allen, a retired salesman. Mary Jane Duke, who attended the Trump rally, said of Mr. Cruz: âHe is not an honest man in my opinion. The fact checks show heâs absolutely telling lies.” The acrimony, not just between the candidates but their base supporters as well, could have significant consequences, both in the short and long term. With polls showing that as many as 25 percent of Republican voters in South Carolina could still change their minds before the primary on Saturday, the deeply negative feelings Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz have planted in the hearts of voters means neither candidate is likely to pick up support from the other team. That could make Senator Marco Rubio of Florida the beneficiary of any defectors, or of any fence-sitters who are simply sick of negative campaigning.  And the Cruz-Trump animosity could also portend long-term difficulties for the Republican Party if one of them becomes the nominee and strong negative impressions remain among the other’s supporters.    âI was somewhat of a fan of Cruz, but I donât like the way heâs been lately,” said Steve Armendt, who has a kitchen countertop business in Myrtle Beach and attended the Trump rally.  âI donât like the way heâs slinging mud against Trump.” Mr. Trump, who on Friday dropped any criticism of Pope Francis after the pope clarified remarks questioning Mr. Trumpâs faith, returned to the more familiar target of Mr. Cruz, whom he has bitterly attacked since the Texas senator won the Iowa caucuses this month. Once again, Mr. Trump accused the Cruz campaign of stealing the Iowa victory by claiming that day, incorrectly, that Ben Carson was dropping out. He also said Mr. Cruz had âdoctored upâ a photo of Mr. Rubio shaking hands with President Obama. âIt never took place,” Mr. Trump said of the photographic forgery on a website made by the Cruz campaign.          Mr. Trump has led South Carolina polls by double digits for months, with his support at 30 percent to 35 percent since early December. Mr. Cruz and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida have broken away from the remaining field and are locked together about 15 percentage points behind Mr. Trump in the Real Clear Politics polling average. Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump have been fighting aggressively for anti-establishment voters in South Carolina, including the many evangelical Christians. Mr. Cruzâs tactics, to judge by Trump supporters, may have tarnished the candidate. âFor somebody like Cruz who professes to be such a strong Christian, to lob those kinds of personal attacks, it seems hypocritical to me,” said Tim McClellan, a facilities manager, who waited in a half-mile line to see Mr. Trump at the Myrtle Beach Sports Center. A television ad Mr. Cruz is running attacking Mr. Trump with old footage of him voicing support for abortion lead Mr. Trump to threaten a lawsuit. The threat drove some Cruz supporters even more firmly into the senator’s camp.  âI think he made a big mistake threatening to do that, because Senator Cruz is an outstanding attorney whoâs represented cases before the Supreme Court,” said Randy Riddle, a retired Presbyterian pastor at the Cruz rally.    Jim Witzigman, a retiree, had narrowed it down to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, but said he now favored Mr. Cruz. âTrump was talking about his sister being a Supreme Court nominee and says he doesnât know what her views are; I donât buy that,” he said. âI donât believe he doesnât know she voted to overturn the ban on partial birth abortion in New Jersey.” Outside the Trump rally, Bill Waters was dressed as a construction worker and held a sign reading âIâm Ready to Work on the Wall.” In his day job, Mr. Waters said, he dresses as the Statue of Liberty and stands outside a tax preparation firm. âYouâll lose if you vote for Cruz,” he chanted to people waiting to enter the event.
