ATLANTA â The final question to the candidate was from Diane: âWhat can people in this room who like what theyâre hearing do to help the campaign?” âDiane, we love you,” Carly Fiorina beamed, before sharing her website and appealing for âyour treasure or your time or your network of people.” Ms. Fiorina rode the wave of good first impressions she had made on Thursday in the undercard debate of Republican presidential candidates in Cleveland into a packed conference of conservatives on Friday.   She was welcomed at the event, Red State Gathering, a group that generally rejects the Republican establishment, with a standing ovation.  There was further applause for her ideologically barbed speech, tougher than ones she often delivers â and for her echo of a charge from the debate that Hillary Rodham Clinton âlied about Benghazi and lied about her emails.” âWeâre going to have a nominee who throws every punch, who will never pull her punches,” Ms. Fiorina, a former tech executive without elected experience, told the crowd.   Attendees echoed the chatter on social media and from some commentators that Ms. Fiorina had been the standout of the second-tier debate among seven candidates with polling numbers that were too low to break into the top 10 in the main event. âI think sheâs going to be in the first cut next time,” said Daniel McCabe, a lawyer from Stamford, Conn. But there is no guarantee of that, given Ms. Fiorinaâs long polling slump since announcing her candidacy and relatively anemic fund-raising. The second debate, on Sept. 16 at the Ronald Reagan Foundation and Library, will also allow only the top 10 candidates in national polls into the main event, with others again at a “kiddie table.” Stephen DeMaura, the executive director of a âsuper PAC” supporting Ms. Fiorina, complained in a memo to reporters on Friday that other candidates had spent lavishly for TV ads to boost their standing in the polls, which he compared to a âsugar high.”   He blasted as a ânational polling charadeâ the criteria used in both of the two first debates by the sponsoring networks, Fox News and CNN.    âThe national polling standards CNN has already announced reward celebrity and Name ID over serious campaigning in the early states and are completely unreflective of how the GOPâs primary process is supposed to work,” Mr. DeMaura said.  The PAC, Carly for America, has taken on most of the tasks of Ms. Fiorinaâs campaign because of its ability to raise money from wealthy donors. Its strategy is to channel its money ($3.4 million raised in the first half of the year) to field organizing in early voting states.  In Atlanta, Ms. Fiorina, whose lack of name recognition means she has opportunities to grow her support, was embraced by the crowd, whose preferences tended to run to rock-ribbed conservatives like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana.  Katie Spee, from Alpharetta, Ga., who had tuned into Ms. Fiorina for the first time, said she liked her answer to a question about her leadership style. Ms. Fiorina said she would fire the leaders of the Department of Veterans Affairs and bring in 10 average veterans, and say to them, âTell us how you want to be served.”
