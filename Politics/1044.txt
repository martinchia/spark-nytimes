After a difficult summer in which she fell behind Senator Bernie Sanders in New Hampshire, Hillary Rodham Clinton has recovered the ground that she lost in the Granite State, and many viewed her debate performance favorably.  A Suffolk University-Boston Globe poll shows the two Democratic presidential candidates virtually tied, with Mrs. Clinton having support of 37 percent of likely Democratic voters and Mr. Sanders at 35 percent. The survey’s margin of error is four percentage points.  A June poll from Suffolk showed Mr. Sanders starting to close the gap with Mrs. Clinton, and he eventually overtook her in New Hampshire after months of negativity  publicity surrounding her use of a private email server as secretary of state. However, Mrs. Clinton’s strong debate performance this week already seems to be paying dividends.  Friday’s poll, which was conducted after the debate on Tuesday, found that 54 percent of the respondents thought Mrs. Clinton was the winner, compared with 24 percent for Mr. Sanders.  Although questions remain about Mrs. Clinton’s trustworthiness, she is the overwhelming favorite among Democrats in the state when it comes to electability in a general election. And the saga over her emails does not seem to bother Democratic voters who are weighing their options.  The Suffolk survey shows an uphill battle for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in New Hampshire, where his support sits at 11 percent and half of those questioned think he should not bother entering the race.  “If heâs going to get in, heâs got to get in soon,” said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. “Weâre four months away from Iowa and New Hampshire.” Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
