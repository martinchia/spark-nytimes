Good Tuesday morning from Washington, where President Obama is hosting Brazilâs leader at the White House. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky heads to Denver to mingle with the marijuana entrepreneurs, and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is set to release his new book. But the political spotlight will be on New Jersey, where the governor is due to announce his next move. Chris Christie will take the stage at his biggest town-hall-style event yet on Tuesday. With a microphone and a setup reminiscent of the forums that made him famous, the Republican governor of New Jersey will announce that he is running for president in his childhood hometown of Livingston on Tuesday morning. Mr. Christie’s announcement has been both expected and uncertain after a string of setbacks including the âBridgegateâ investigation, a wobbly state economy and Jeb Bush‘s entrance in the race. Many political operatives believed he might decide to skip the campaign. Yet Mr. Christie, whom many Republican donors and elected officials urged to run in 2012, is seizing what is very likely his last chance to seek the presidency. No longer considered a front-runner, Mr. Christieâs path toward raising money is unclear. However, the governorâs aides believe his now-famously brash persona will allow him to rise in a crowded field of candidates criticized as milquetoast or as mired in clashes over issues like same-sex marriage and overhauling immigration. What makes Mr. Christie stand out â his temperament â has often been his undoing over the years. Whether he can keep the focus on voters, and avoid talking too much about himself while trying to connect with them, remains to be seen. Maggie Haberman Presidential candidates face a midnight deadline to close the books on their first-quarter fund-raising. Mr. Cruzâs new book, “A Time for Truth,” is set to be released. Mr. Obama will participate in a conference call at 2:45 p.m. to discuss the importance of reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank. The Conference Board releases its monthly index of consumer confidence at 10 a.m. The somewhat surprising Supreme Court decision upholding independent congressional redistricting efforts immediately touched off a push to get more nonpartisan commissions in place before the next reapportionment after the 2020 census. Backers of taking some of the politics out of the decennial redrawing of the lines for House districts said Monday’s ruling eliminated the legal uncertainty surrounding such efforts. It could also provide momentum for state initiatives with three election cycles â 2016, 2018 and 2020 â before new districts need to be mapped out. “I believe we have a chance to make Congress work again for the American people by creating competitive districts,” said Ellen O. Tauscher, a former centrist Democratic House member from California and former State Department official. She is forming a new bipartisan group, “YouDrawTheLines2021,” to push commissions similar to the one adopted in her home state. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, called on Congress to pass standards for independent commissions, but most of the activity is likely to take place in multiple states where some grass-roots moves toward independent redistricting were already happening. With the polarization of Congress as evidence of the need for change and the new ruling, advocates of more neutral congressional mapmaking have a significant opening. — Carl Hulse Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will hold a meeting in the Oval Office on Tuesday with President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil two years after she canceled a state visit because of revelations that the National Security Agency was spying on her. On Monday, Mr. Obama took Ms. Rousseff on a quick visit to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, a place he seems to favor when seeking better ties with foreign leaders. On a beautiful sunny day, Mr. Obama pointed to different parts of the memorial as they walked around it. The two leaders had dinner on Monday night, with a menu that included heirloom tomatoes, eggplant bruschetta, lamb and wilted spinach, and coconut banana opera cake with espresso ice cream for dessert. Mr. Biden is joining the Oval Office meeting with Ms. Rousseff on Tuesday because he has visited Brazil three times in three years, most recently to attend Ms. Rousseffâs inauguration in January. Mr. Obama and Ms. Rousseff will hold a news conference shortly after noon, when a defense cooperation agreement is expected to be announced along with efforts to advance trade between the two countries. Ms. Rousseff is hoping the visit improves her image at home, where her approval ratings are abysmal because of a moribund economy and a continuing corruption scandal. — Gardiner Harris A look at Mr. Christie‘s planned announcement, where he stands on the issues, his path to the nomination and five things you might not know about him.
