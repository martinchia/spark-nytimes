Speaker John A. Boehner and a House delegation have wrapped up a three-day trip to Lithuania, where aides said he reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to resisting Russian aggression in the region. Visiting the capital, Vilnius, to mark the country’s 25th anniversary of independence, Mr. Boehner and seven other House members discussed security issues with the nation’s leaders, including legislation that gave the Obama administration the ability to provide arms to Ukraine. Mr. Boehner and the delegation also visited a new liquefied natural gas terminal that could help ease Russian energy dominance in the region. The group Monday visited barricades Lithuanians erected in 1991 to protect government buildings from Russian forces. Mr. Boehner frequently says American allies in world trouble spots are uncertain about the Obama administration’s foreign policy intentions and he has used overseas trips such as the one to Lithuania to offer reassurances to friendly nations. “Whether it’s arming Ukraine or declaring energy independence, Lithuania sets an example for the region, and frankly the world,” Mr. Boehner said at a news conference following a weekend meeting at the presidential palace.
