As most members of Congress return to Washington today for what is expected to be a very busy session, Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican, will be flying down to Kentucky to visit with Kim Davis, the jailed Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses. Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, is also holding an event outside the Carter County Detention Center in where Ms. Davis is currently being held. Mr. Huckabee announced his visit last week, but the two Republican candidates will not be holding a joint rally, according to the Cruz campaign. Mr. Cruz, instead, will fly down early and then take questions from the press around 1 p.m. Mr. Huckabeeâs event will start around 2:30, and feature Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council and Mathew D. Staver of Liberty Counsel. Both candidates have been among the most vociferous in supporting Ms. Davis. Mr. Cruz released a statement after her arrest that called on âevery believer, every constitutionalist, every lover of liberty to stand with Kim Davis.â Mr. Huckabee took to Twitter on the day of Ms. Davisâs arrest, posting many messages: I stand w/ Kim Davis & Americans of faith under attack by Washington elites who have nothing but disdain for our faith & the Constitution. — Gov. Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) September 2, 2015  And he has also introduced a “Free Kim Davis Now” petition through his campaign.
