Senator Marco Rubio praised Megyn Kelly, the Fox News debate moderator who has come under fire from Donald J. Trump, but said he was not going to comment on Mr. Trump’s latest remarks. Mr. Rubio, a Republican presidential candidate and Florida senator who received mostly positive reviews for his performance in the Fox News debate this week, made the comments to Chuck Todd in a taped interview that will be broadcast Sunday on NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” Asked whether Mr. Trump should apologize for his caustic remarks about Ms. Kelly, Mr. Rubio replied, “I think Megyn Kelly is very good. She’s going to ask tough questions. She’s a strong woman, and I think she can take anything that comes her way.” But he added, “I’ve made a decision here with Donald Trump. You know, if I comment on everything he says, my whole campaign will be consumed by it. That’s all I’ll do all day. ” Republicans “welcome anybody who wants to be a part of the Republican Party. He obviously has the poll numbers that justify him being on the stage, and we’ll let him answer for what he says and so forth. At this point, I mean, we’ve got to focus on our message.” Otherwise, he said, “my whole campaign will be what â how do you feel about what Donald Trump said about something. He says something every day.” Mr. Rubio’s comments reflect the difficulty some candidates are having with respect to Mr. Trump, who has caused considerable angst among Republican leaders over his increasingly contentious statements, but who polls show is tapping into anti-establishment anger within the party’s base.
