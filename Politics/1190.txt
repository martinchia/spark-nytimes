Right to Rise, the “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush that has dominated the ad-spending battle so far, has canceled up to a third of its ad reservations in March 1 primary states, according to media buying sources. By early January, the group had reservations for about $10 million in the Super Tuesday states of Texas, Tennessee, Virginia, Oklahoma and Georgia, having booked them far in advance to ensure lower rates. The cancellation has not, at this point, been accompanied by increased advertising in South Carolina, whose Republican primary voters cast their ballots on Saturday. Mr. Bush is depending on a strong showing there to capitalize on a his fourth-place finish in New Hampshire, which his campaign said had âreset the race.â  The group said it was using the cancellation to help prioritize future buys. âDelaying these start dates will give us the opportunity to prioritize our resources following South Carolina as we look ahead to the important March 1 states,â said Paul Lindsay, a spokesman for the group. Right to Rise had reported $59 million cash on hand at the start of the year and said it had raised $118 million to date, but those figures did not include the cost of the final six weeks of advertising before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primaries, where the group spent heavily.
