Good Thursday morning, as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas continues his Southern bus tour, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont catches Hillary Rodham Clinton in New Hampshire, and soapbox stump speeches and the smells of fried foods and natural fertilizers await the candidates in Iowa. Charlie Szold, the communications director for the Republican Party of Iowa, sent an email on Wednesday, saying that â97 percent of Iowa corn has reached the âsilking stage.â â And that can mean only one thing: Itâs State Fair time. The 11-day Iowa State Fair beginning on Thursday in Des Moines is Iowaâs biggest event of the year. Its one million visitors come to ogle a life-size cow sculpted from butter, visit the livestock barns, and snack on fried Oreos and pork chops on a stick. But the fair is also a political cornucopia. Nearly every candidate from both parties is planning a visit, braving the scorching weather to coax a few more voters in the first-in-the-nation nominating state. Most candidates will speak for 20 minutes on the Soapbox, a stage that has hay bale seating and is sponsored by The Des Moines Register. It is a rare occasion to address a bipartisan crowd and has elicited memorable moments over the years. It was here that Mitt Romney told a heckler in 2011 that âcorporations are people, my friend,” a line that followed him through the general election. Mike Huckabee is first on the schedule on Thursday morning, followed by the Democrats Jim Webb, the former Virginia senator, and Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor. Jeb Bush will appear on Friday, with most of the rest of the candidates appearing over the weekend and into next week. Mrs. Clinton is visiting the fair on Saturday, but will not speak publicly on the Soapbox. Donald J. Trump, whose offer of childrenâs rides in his helicopter was nixed by fair officials, was said to be heading to the fair on Saturday as well, though at the time of publication, the details were sketchy. His campaign told The Des Moines Register that Mr. Trump would not, as earlier reported, be introducing Def Leppard on the Grandstand stage.

Several other candidates will be in Iowa as they wait for their turn at the fair.Rick Santorum, who ended his schedule there on Wednesday night with a Pints and Politics event, starts his day with a Coffee and Conversation town-hall-style meeting, before heading to a pork roast in Henry County.Mr. Bush will attend the Polk County 2015 Summer Sizzle, a gathering “for family fun, classic cars and great food.”And Carly Fiorina, who has emerged as a Republican weapon against charges that the party is engaged in a war on women, will hold a town-hall-style event. In New Hampshire, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ben Carson have the place to themselves. Maybe itâs because a new poll in New Hampshire has Mr. Sanders tied with Mrs. Clinton among likely Democratic primary voters. Or maybe itâs because the attention paid to Mrs. Clintonâs sweeping plan to make college more affordable was eclipsed by headlines like, âThe email story just keeps getting worse for Hillary Clinton.â Whatever the reason, the Clinton campaign has chosen the August doldrums to go on offense after months of coverage about her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state. On Tuesday, after the campaign said Mrs. Clinton had directed aides to give the Justice Department the server and a thumb drive that contained copies of the emails, her advisers convened a late-night conference call to get surrogates on message. (âHillary Clintonâs use of personal email was consistent with the practice of prior secretaries of state and permitted at the time she was secretary of state,â read a crucial talking point.) Then, on Wednesday, Jennifer Palmieri, a spokeswoman for the campaign, emailed supporters, âA note about Hillary Clintonâs emailsâ that tried to explain the latest development. âMany of the Republican candidates for president have done the same things for which theyâre now criticizing Hillary,â Ms. Palmieri wrote. Mr. Sanders was not mentioned. â Amy Chozick Though Mr. Sanders is engaged in a tight race with Mrs. Clinton in New Hampshire, according to recent polls, it is hard to say who is winning. The most recent poll, from Franklin Pierce University and the Boston Herald, showed Mr. Sanders with the support of 44 percent of likely Democratic voters and Mrs. Clinton at 37 percent. The poll of 442 people claimed to have a margin of error of 4.7 percentage points, which The New York Times, as per policy, rounded to five. While many headlines blared that Mr. Sanders had overtaken Mrs. Clinton in New Hampshire, The Times confused some readers by reporting this as a âstatistical tie.â Why, many asked, was Mr. Sanders not winning if he was up by number greater than the margin of error? As The Timesâs polling team notes, the difference between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton is not statistically significant, despite what the headline numbers might to suggest. âA poll’s aim is to try to figure out what a certain population thinks by interviewing a small sample of that group and weighting the results,â said Megan Thee-Brenan, deputy editor of news surveys at The Times. âBut even with good weighting, there is error built into the process.â The fastest way to roughly determine whether the difference between two candidates is statistically significant is to double the margin of sampling error â in this case five â and compare that number with the difference between the two percentages. For Mr. Sanders or Mrs. Clinton to be âwinningâ in this poll, one of them would have to be up by roughly more than 10 points. â Alan Rappeport The passions of big contributors â and their ability to change a candidateâs fortunes â are a keenly felt undercurrent to the debate over the fate of President Obamaâs nuclear deal with Iran. A word catches fire on social media among disaffected Republicans, called racist by some, who feel their candidates lean too far left. During a campaign trip to New Hampshire, Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio said that conservatives should not be shy about saying that âwe care about people who are down and out, and we want to give them a chance to succeed.â And former President Jimmy Carter said that recent liver surgery revealed cancer that had spread to several parts of his body.   A group that includes the great-great-grandson of Charles Darwin and 28 Nobel laureates, Newsweek writes, has been pressing for presidential candidates to hold a science-only debate, under the thinking that many of the most important issues on the trail “are impossible to discuss without dealing with physics, math and biology.” In 2008, they were ignored. But, this year, they “believe they have a better chance.” “If Donald Trump were to ask me to be his running mate,” Jesse Ventura, a former professional wrestler, movie star and governor of Minnesota told a local CBS station, “I would give it very serious consideration.” And The Huffington Post profiles a key campaign staff member on Mr. O’Malley’s team: his teenage son. Both the Democratic and Republican parties are seeing the rise of outsider candidates like Mr. Sanders, Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump as they campaign against the established political status quo, The Washington Post reports. Politico looks at how Huma Abedin, Mrs. Clinton‘s most trusted aide, is becoming increasingly embroiled in her boss’s email scandal. Mr. Cruz reached behind the black leather seat for his briefcase. âThe bus tour doesnât let me read, I read on airplanes,â he said. âThis bus tour is terrible for that.â As he has zigzagged across the country, often cramming in three or four events a day with hours of travel between, heâs working between too, signing books, doing interviews and playing with his two children. But, he still came prepared, and offered First Draft a look at his current reading list. The two books in his briefcase were from prominent conservative voices: âThe Conservative Heart,â by Arthur Brooks, president of the American Enterprise Institute, which Mr. Cruz said he was in the middle of and enjoying greatly, and âPlunder and Deceit,â by Mark R. Levin, the nationally syndicated conservative radio host. But Mr. Cruz heaped the most praise on two books he had recently finished. The first was, âReckless Endangerment,â by Gretchen Morgenson, a Times reporter, and Joshua Rosner, about the financial crisis. âA great book,” Mr. Cruz said. But his favorite? âThe Looming Tower,â by Lawrence Wright. âItâs just gripping,â Mr. Cruz said, âhighly recommendingâ the book to First Draft. âIt traces back to the 1950s and the rise of radical Islam, and it goes through it just with a level of detail.â âAnd itâs well written,â he added. âItâs a great read.â â Nick Corasaniti Like the Politics Newsletter?
