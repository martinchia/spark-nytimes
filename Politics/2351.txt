Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These areÂ the places, faces and culinary selectionsÂ of 2016âs first proper bus tour. EVENT 10 Time: 12:25 p.m., Jan. 6 Place: Sibley, Iowa (population: 2,798) Site: Lantern Coffeehouse & Roastery, with exposed brick walls and snowfall visible through the front windows Mood: vigorous nodding, warm drinks Food: rainbow candy canes, Trader Joe’s Speculoos cookie butter, soft molasses cookies (three for $1) Tunes: Saying he hoped for snow on caucus day, Bob Vander Plaats, an Iowa religious leader and Cruz endorser, broke briefly into song: âIâm dreaming â¦ of a whiiiiiite â¦ caucus.â Reviews were mixed. âItâs bad, I know,â he said. Beetlejuice-esque website plug: âTedCruz.org,â Mr. Cruz said at one point, adding, âTedCruz.org. TedCruz.org.â Highlight: Mr. Cruz lampooned the anodyne âissuesâ pages populating most candidatesâ websites. He used gun rights as an example. âIn a Republican primary in Texas or Iowa, there is a right answer on the Second Amendment: âI support the Second Amendment,ââ he said. âUnless you are clinically insane, thatâs what you say.â His page, by contrast, includes a âProven Recordâ tab as well, detailing his practical experience. âI donât say a word,â he said,â about whatâs hidden in the deep recesses of my heart.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
