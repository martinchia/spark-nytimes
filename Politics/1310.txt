MANCHESTER, N.H. â Viewers in New Hampshire are seeing a lot more of Bernie Sanders during the breaks in their favorite television shows than they are Hillary Clinton. Almost double, in fact. The Sanders campaign is outspending Mrs. Clinton’s team in the New Hampshire media market, with about $1.3 million in paid advertising time and reservations for the week after the Iowa caucuses. The Clinton campaign has spent about $580,000 in paid advertising and reservations. One reason for the discrepancy: The Sanders campaign has dedicated more than half its budget for this week to the Boston media market. It is the most expensive of the four markets serving New Hampshire (the others are Manchester, N.H.; Portland, Me.; and Burlington, Vt.). And it is also the biggest market in Massachusetts, which votes on March 1 as part of Super Tuesday and is a prime target for the Sanders campaign. âWeâre making an investment in a March 1st state,â said Tad Devine, a senior strategist with the Sanders campaign. âWeâre running against someone who won that state against Barack Obama in 2008.â As of November, the most recent poll from The Boston Globe had Mrs. Clinton with a 25-point lead, 54 percent to 29 percent, over Mr. Sanders among likely Democratic voters in Massachusetts.  Mrs. Clinton hasnât been silent on advertising. Just this week she aired two new ads in Las Vegas and one in South Carolina. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign didnât immediately respond to requests for comment.
