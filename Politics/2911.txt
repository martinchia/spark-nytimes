Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey was not even invited to the main stage of the last Republican debate, but he has managed to get the attention of the Republican presidential candidate who is leading in the polls. As Mr. Christie’s courtship of New Hampshire voters has started showing signs of paying off, Donald J. Trump took an impromptu shot at the governor’s record in New Jersey on Monday in hopes of slowing his momentum. How is Chris Christie running the state of NJ, which is deeply troubled, when he is spending all of his time in NH? New Jerseyans not happy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2015  Mr. Christie has been languishing in most state and national polls this election cycle, as Mr. Trump has stolen some of his thunder as the party’s bombastic straight talker. But he has remained a persistent presence in New Hampshire â the first state to hold a primary election â and over the weekend won a valuable endorsement from the influential New Hampshire Union Leader newspaper. Mr. Christie is returning to New Hampshire on Monday to accept the endorsement of Renee Plummer, a prominent Republican businesswoman and political activist in the state. While he claims to only be a counterpuncher, Mr. Trump hasÂ a tendency to attack rivals when they show signs of strength. He raised questions about Ben Carson’s religion when the retired neurosurgeon started surging in Iowa and hit Senator Marco Rubio on his attendance record in the Senate when the Florida Republican started getting too close for comfort in the polls. Mr. Trump has largely left Mr. Christie alone until now, occasionally criticizing his record of managing his state’s struggling economy, where the billionaire developer once ran a number of casinos. On Monday he made clear he is watching Mr. Christie’s movements in New Hampshire. “New Jerseyans not happy!” he said.
