Surrounded by immigrants from several countries, Martin OâMalley, the Democratic presidential hopeful, pledged on Tuesday to go further on overhauling the immigration system than any other candidate, in a clear effort to present a contrast with Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mr. OâMalley, speaking at an event at the New York State Immigrant Action Fund in New York, ticked off several proposals that he would carry out as president, vowing to close detention centers where those on the verge of being deported are often held and saying that the nationâs enduring symbol should not be a “barbed-wire fence.â Calling the current immigration system “inhumane,” he also characterized overhauling immigration as a basic economic issue, suggesting it could help the nation get back on a solid footing on jobs and wage growth. For Mr. OâMalley, the former governor of Maryland, the issue of immigration is a familiar one. He has spoken repeatedly about his support for allowing illegal immigrants to get driver’s licenses, an issue that tripped up Mrs. Clinton, then a senator from New York, in a Democratic presidential primary debate in 2007. But he also clashed with the White House in 2014 amid a surge of migrants, many of them children, illegally coming into the United States from Central America to escape violence at home. Mr. OâMalley faulted the White House for its policies of returning the children to their home countries, something that Mrs. Clinton expressed support for during her book tour for her memoir, âHard Choices.â Mr. OâMalley vowed to work on resolving a deadlock over the issue in Congress, where comprehensive immigration overhaul efforts have stalled. Several of the immigrants who appeared with Mr. O’Malley talked about their own stories of hardship, explaining their desire to live legally in the United States. Mr. Obama last fall took executive action to block millions of deportations. Mrs. Clinton has said she would go further than the president did, but has not laid out a concrete plan yet.
