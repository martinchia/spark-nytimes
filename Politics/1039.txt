Republicans have made a sport out of critiquing those posing the questions in this yearâs presidential campaign. But they are finding a reliable ally in Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. He is now playing the role of serial media critic, scolding his interviewers for their interest in political intrigue and disagreements between candidates. On Sunday, Mr. Sanders made his displeasure known in a series of television appearances. âIf I may,â Mr. Sanders tsk-tsked at George Stephanopoulos of ABCâs âThis Week,â when asked about his differences with Hillary Rodham Clinton. âWe need to have a media more interested in the issues facing working-class people and the middle class rather than political gossip.â Pressed on his relationship with President Obama, Mr. Sanders grew annoyed once again. âLook, this is media stuff,â he said. Chuck Todd, the host of âMeet The Press,â earned a similar â and almost identically worded â rebuke on Sunday, when he asked whether Mr. Sanders was turning more negative in his approach to Mrs. Clinton. âDo you want to target Hillary Clinton personally?â he asked. Mr. Sanders had had enough. âChuck,â he said, âthis is exactly media stuff.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
