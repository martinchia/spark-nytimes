RYE, N.H. â Jeb Bush needs a boost. Heâs getting a bus. As his presidential campaign limps through the fall, Mr. Bush invited a small group of reporters on Tuesday aboard his new ride, with âJeb Can Fix Itâ etched across the side. A recap of how it played out: 6:34 p.m.Â Mr. Bush comes to the back, where two long black leather couches stretch beneath the windows. âNice boots,â he says to a television reporter, striding over in his own. They are inscribed with his name. 6:38Â Mr. Bush is asked why heâs on a bus. âYou get to hang out with people,â he says. âWeâll have people off and on the bus, not just press but people from New Hampshire. Put the full court press on âem. Before they leave, theyâve got to say, âYes, Iâm for you.â â Dutiful laughter fills the bus. âShh. Itâs a secret plan,â he says. âWeâll talk about that later.â 6:43Â A local television reporter, who has been covering Mr. Bush, introduces herself. âYou donât think we notice you?â he asks. âYouâre hurting my feelings that I wouldnât recognize you.â He crosses his legs, boot heel angled skyward. 6:48Â Mr. Bush recalls last weekâs debate. âThe debate, the so-called debate, is more of a performance,â he says. âIt gives you an opportunity to say whatever you want. Iâve got to train myself to say whatâs on my mind rather than what the question is.â How can he master that art? âAfter 62 years?â he asks. He laughs at himself. âI donât think any question that we prepared for was a question we were asked,â he continues, knocking the CNBC moderators, âbecause they didnât do anything they said they were going to do.â 6:50Â Mr. Bush is asked about his nerves. âI felt really good about the debate I screwed up on,â he says. He clarifies that this was before the debate started: âNo, I felt bad after.â What happens? âI got shouted down when I tried to interrupt in the beginning. Then I couldnât finish the sentence in the Marco deal,â he says, about an exchange regarding Marco Rubioâs Senate voting record. Mr. Bush is asked if he has to stop directly answering the debate questions to succeed. âYeah. Iâve got to stop doing that. Itâs kind of weird, but thatâs why itâs not really a debate.â 6:52Â Mr. Bush decides he should keep answering questions after all, to a point. âIâve just got to be clear about what I want to say,â he says. âI think I know what I want to say.” 6:54Â Mr. Bush discusses his media consumption habits. âI donât read every word of what you guys record or write,â he says. âThereâs a lot of stuff. Everybodyâs prolific in their reporting and stuff. And it doesnât help me get better, per se.â 6:58Â Mr. Bush discusses his actual consumption habits. âMaybe after,â he says, waving off an aide offering M&Ms. âIâve got another gig here.â âA little energy?â the aide, Tim Miller, says. âA little sustenance?â Mr. Bush feigns annoyance at the echo of a Trumpian insult: âYou think I need a little more energy?â He scoops up some turkey jerky. 7:01 Mr. Bush is asked about how to reconcile his campaign message with voter frustrations.
 âYouâve got to connect with that frustration,â he says, adding, âCan you rely on someone that has no proven record of getting things done?â 7:03Â Mr. Bush recalls his attack on Mr. Rubio during the debate, when he likened life in Congress to a âFrench workweek.â âI really did a disservice to the French,â he says. âI now know that the average French workweek is actually greater than the German workweek. And so, my God, I totally insulted an entire country, our first ally, that helped us become free as a nation. And I apologize.â 7:05Â Mr. Bush mulls the groundswell of support for Donald J. Trump and Ben Carson. âIâm not smart enough to know, to explain the Trump or Carson phenomena yet,â he says. âCarson is such a nice person. I mean, heâs really a nice guy.â Mr. Bush is asked if someone without any government experience can succeed as president. âWe might find out,â he says. 7:07Â Mr. Bush, after mentioning Richard M. Nixonâs famous visit to China, wonders if his references are connecting. âI used the Nixon-to-China analogy once in front of a group of young people who looked at me like, âWhoâs Nixon?ââ he says. He turns to this reporter: âDo you know what the Nixon-to-China moment is?â I do. 7:08Â Mr. Bush muses on his new physique, aided by a paleo diet.Â  âDoes it take getting used to?â he asks, repeating a reporterâs question. âNo.â He chides those who failed to join him at Goldâs Gym in Charleston, S.C. âAt 5:30, I was there,â he says. 7:09Â Mr. Bush is not done musing. âI am in good shape,â he says for emphasis. 7:10Â Mr. Bush, asked a pro forma question about how he stays positive every day, waxes surprisingly philosophical. âIâve learned to accept the fact that I am imperfect under Godâs watchful eye,â he says. âI can get better. I donât have a self-esteem problem and I donât have an overstated worth problem. Thereâs a balance that Iâve acquired in life through my journey in life that gives me serenity.â 7:13Â Mr. Bush notes his staff members’ ability to overcome obstacles during his time as Florida governor.Â  âWe all learned how to identify â I canât use the terms that we used â the poo bombs that were around the corner,â he says. He extends the analogy: âThey learned how to anticipate these things happening, look up, take two steps to the side, let it splat on the sidewalk and keep going.â 7:14Â Mr. Bush praises his campaign workers’ dedication to details. âWeâve laid out more details, scored by all the nerdy bean counters,â he says of his policy proposals. 7:15Â Mr. Bush excuses himself.Â  âIâve got to get into my mind-set here,â he says, as the bus arrives in Raymond, N.H., for a town hall. 7:16 Mr. Bush teases his campaign workers’ dedication to details.Â  âYouâve got 47 minutes for Q. and A.?â he asks an aide with his schedule, within earshot of the reporters. âWhat about 45 and a half?â He steps off the bus.
