In Iowa, when J. Ann Selzer talks, people listen. Many surprising findings in a new survey by Ms. Selzer, Iowaâs most respected pollster, are sure to be topics of elated or anxious conversations on campaign conference calls on Monday morning. Among the findings, released Saturday night: Hillary Rodham Clintonâs lead over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has shrunk to just 7 percentage points; Donald J. Trumpâs favorability with Republicans has sharply increased, suggesting he has room to increase his lead; and Democrats are largely untroubled about Mrs. Clintonâs email controversy â suggesting her vulnerabilities are deeper. With both partiesâ nominating races entering a more serious phase after Labor Day, there is room for candidates to move up or down, but the late-summer snapshot in the poll, conducted for The Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics, will concentrate the minds of many of the candidates.  Mrs. Clintonâs support among likely Democratic caucus-goers dropped 20 percentage points from Ms. Selzer’s previous Iowa Poll in May; Mr. Sandersâs support grew 25 points since January. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has not said if he will run, polled at 14 percent. If he doesn’t run, his supporters would split equally between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders. Three other Democrats in the race, Martin OâMalley, Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee, who are at 3 percent or less, would have to forfeit their supporters if the caucuses were held now. Democratic rules require candidates to reach a viability level of around 15 percent for their votes to be counted. Mr. Trump, who was the choice of 23 percent of likely Republican caucus-goers, was viewed favorably by 61 percent, a startling rise of 34 percentage points since May.  In another eye-opening finding, business-oriented establishment Republicans preferred Mr. Trump to Jeb Bush 30 percent to 16 percent. The retired surgeon Ben Carson, another outsider candidate, drew 18 percent support, ranking second in the Republican field. Others who improved since May included Ted Cruz, at 8 percent, and Carly Fiorina, at 5 percent.   Scott Walker, also at 8 percent, continued to slide from earlier in the year when he was the first choice of Iowa Republicans.   Mr. Bush and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, both at 6 percent, had about the same support as in May.   What is driving Mr. Trump’s support? More than 90 percent of Republicans said they were unsatisfied or âmad as hellâ with the United States government and politicians in general.  Here is how The Register put it: âLike Democrats in 2007 who looked for their savior in Barack Obama, Republicans in 2015 seem to be looking for their savior in Trump.ââ Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
