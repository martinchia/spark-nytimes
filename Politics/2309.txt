Donald J. Trump often excoriates the news media, calling reporters dishonest or disgusting. On Tuesday night, after Mr. Trump’s lengthy news conference in Jupiter, Fla., claiming victory in the Michigan and Mississippi primaries, that antagonism turned physical, according to a journalist who said she was grabbed roughly by Mr. Trumpâs campaign manager. The Trump campaign disputed her account. The reporter, Michelle Fields of the conservative website Breitbart News, said that she was yanked from behind when she tried to ask Mr. Trump, who was slowly making his way out of the room, a question about affirmative action. âSomeone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down,â she wrote Thursday in a post describing the incident. âI almost fell to the ground, but was able to maintain my balance. Nonetheless, I was shaken.â  Ms. Fields said that another reporter, Ben Terris of The Washington Post, identified the man who grabbed her as Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager. Mr. Terris, in his own first-person article on Thursday, described Mr. Lewandowski as having âgrabbed her arm and yanked her out of the way.â Mr. Terris added: âFields stumbled. Finger-shaped bruises formed on her arm.â Hope Hicks, a Trump spokeswoman, called both Ms. Fieldsâs and Mr. Terrisâs accounts âcompletely false.â Ms. Hicks asserted that the two reporters had ânever met Corey.â She said she herself âdid not witness any encounter,â and noted that ânot a single camera or reporter of more than 100 in attendance captured the alleged incident.â âThere are often large crowds aggressively seeking access to Mr. Trump, and our staff would never do anything to harm another individual,â Ms. Hicks said in a statement. Ms. Fields responded by posting on Twitter a picture of her arm, showing bruise marks. âI guess these just magically appeared on me,â she wrote.
