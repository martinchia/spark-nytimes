Hillary Rodham Clinton’s campaign has received commitments from four Democratic state parties, including in the crucial proving ground of New Hampshire, to enter joint fund-raising agreements with the campaign just as the nomination battle is beginning. The four are a small fraction of the dozens of state parties that the Hillary for America campaign has asked to join such agreements. Many are still considering the request; some officials said they are working through how the arrangement would be put into effect while the nominating fight is underway. Mississippi, Virginia and Wisconsin have also signed agreements with the Clinton team, according to two people briefed on the issue who were not authorized to speak publicly. Virginia, a critical general election battleground, is home to Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a close friend of Mrs. Clinton’s and a former Democratic National Committee chairman.  The move to create the “Victory Funds” – in which the money raised would be divided between the state parties and the Clinton campaign – comes as efforts to form a joint fund-raising agreement with the Democratic National Committee have repeatedly hit snags over concerns in the Clinton campaign about the current party leadership’s controlling the money in any shared account. The national committee, which is intended to remain neutral, has been accused by Mrs. Clinton’s rivals for the  nomination of taking actions that could benefit Mrs. Clinton, such as restricting the number of debates.  Even as some of the recent efforts by the D.N.C., such as devising the debate schedule, have been seen as beneficial to Mrs. Clinton, discussions for a joint fund-raising agreement between Mrs. Clinton’s campaign and the D.N.C. have repeatedly hit snags. There are concerns and distrust within the candidate’s campaign of the current party leadership in terms of controlling the money in a shared account, according to three people briefed on the issue.  Officials with Mrs. Clinton’s campaign declined repeated requests for comment.  Aides to two other Democratic candidates, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, who both have deep institutional ties and the ability to raise money, also declined to comment for this article. Another Democrat who could potentially attract major donors, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., is considering a run.  The state party arrangement does not directly relate to the national committee, but several committee officials were said to have been unaware until recent weeks that Mrs. Clinton’s team planned such a move. Some Democrats who are not allied with any campaign also privately expressed surprise, suggesting a note of presumption while the primary campaign is still taking place. They wondered about the value of emphasizing joint fund-raising agreements when Republicans have quickly outpaced Mrs. Clinton in raising money with “super PACs.” New Hampshire’s participation in the arrangement could also raise questions for the party: The state party’s chairman, Raymond Buckley, is a vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee. The agreements have been reached just ahead of the D.N.C.’s meeting at the end of this week in Minnesota, where the candidates will attend and address party officials. In a statement, Mr. Buckley said, “I don’t think it is ever too early to start preparing to win the general election. State parties can sign such a fund-raising agreement with each of the candidates and I’ve told them all I’m willing to sign one for them.”   The agreement could grant the state parties access to more resources and allow extra help with voter registration and other matters. The option is legally available to any Democratic candidate. â¨â¨But only Mrs. Clinton has the ability to tap into donors who can write large checks, as well as the infrastructure that makes the arrangement work. Officials in the states to which Mrs. Clinton has the closest personal ties, New York and Arkansas, said they were considering whether to move forward. â¨â¨”Itâs being reviewed,” said Basil Smikle, the executive director of the New York State Democratic Party and a former Senate aide to Mrs. Clinton. “We look forward to working with and supporting Secretary Clintonâs campaign for president.” Some officials at state parties suggested the practice is similar to a fund-raising agreement with the campaign of a sitting senator or an insurgent in a statewide race. Those officials described it as similar to what Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, had with state parties. â¨â¨But others expressed reservations about the appearance â and realities â of the practice before there is a nominee.
