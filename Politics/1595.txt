A “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush raised huge contributions from a wide array of Bush family business associates, prominent Republican donors, and former political appointees of his brother and father, according to disclosures submitted to the Federal Election Commission on Friday.  More than 80 individuals or corporations have given $1 million or more to presidential campaigns and the political organizations supporting the candidates. The super PAC, Right to Rise USA, raised about $103 million during the first six months of the year, easily outpacing groups supporting Mr. Bush’s rivals for the Republican nomination. At least 26 individuals or companies contributed more than $1 million to the group, including Mike Fernandez, a Cuban-American billionaire who gave $3 million; Francis Rooney, a former ambassador to the Vatican, who gave over $2 million; and Helen Schwab, wife of the investor Charles R. Schwab, who gave $1.5 million. Another 22 donors contributed at least $500,000, according to the filing. And close to $30 million of the total came from Florida, where Mr. Bush served two terms as governor. Corporations provided $16.3 million of the group’s total, underscoring the unique advantages of super PACs: Mr. Bush’s presidential campaign committee is banned from accepting corporate gifts. And donations to super PACs are unlimited, while campaign committees are limited to raising $2,700 from each donor for the primary election, and the same amount for the general election. At least 28 former United States ambassadors, or companies they control, contributed a total of $5 million to the super PAC. They include Al Hoffman and Mel Sembler, Florida investors and longtime Bush allies, and John Negroponte, a former U.S. diplomat and ambassador to Iraq. Members of the Bush family also donated: Former President George W. Bush, Mr. Bush’s brother, contributed $95,000, while his father, former President George Bush, gave $125,000. American Pacific International Capital, a San Francisco-based company whose board members include another brother, Neil Bush, gave $1.3 million. And a cousin, the health care executive Jonathan Bush, gave $100,000. The 2016 race could be the most expensive in history, in part because of spending by âsuper PACs.â Legally, the groups cannot coordinate with candidates, but there is plenty of wiggle room.   Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
