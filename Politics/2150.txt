Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, endorsed Senator Ted Cruz on Monday, trumpeting his âwillingness to take on the Washington cartel.â Mr. Perry, who ended his own run for president in September, said his stateâs junior senator was âready to serve as commander in chief on Day 1.â The endorsement, reported by Politico on Monday, comes two days after another high-profile announcement of support for Mr. Cruz by Glenn Beck, the radio host. Mr. Cruz called Mr. Perry âa friend and a remarkable public servant,â praising his economic stewardship of Texas. Mr. Cruz also served under Mr. Perry as the stateâs solicitor general.
