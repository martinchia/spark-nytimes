For much of the year, Jeb Bush has sent conflicting signals about how he planned to deal with the legacy of his brother, former President George W. Bush â reaching for it in some cases, distancing himself in others. But on Thursday, the day after the second Republican presidential debate, in which he strongly defended his brother against Donald J. Trump, Mr. Bush highlighted that moment on his Twitter feed. Around noon, Mr. Bush sent out this remark, “When it comes to my brother, there’s one thing I know for sure. He kept us safe.” That quotation was next to a photo of a memorable moment â his brother standing next to a New York City firefighter atop the rubble of the destroyed World Trade Center towers in Lower Manhattan days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.  He kept us safe. pic.twitter.com/Plq9Hm7caE — Jeb Bush (@JebBush) September 17, 2015  The moment during the debate when Jeb Bush defended his brother, whose foreign policy record has repeatedly been criticized by some of the Republicans running for president, was widely seen as one of his strongest of the night.  In his Twitter post, he made no mention of the terrorist attacks, the worst ever on United States soil, which took place during his brother’s first term in office. As the campaign has gone on, Mr. Bush’s allies have felt he has been in something of a no-win situation with his brother. Mr. Bush has said he is his own man, as some critics have sought to tether him to his brother’s legacy, but Mr. Bush has also made clear in several speeches his love for the former president.  While Mr. Bush is struggling in polls in the early states and nationally, his brother remains highly popular with Republican primary voters in Iowa and South Carolina, and embracing him could be helpful.
