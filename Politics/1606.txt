In what appears to be either a premature presidential announcement or a tease of one to get attention, the Twitter account of Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin sent word on Friday afternoon that he was seeking the 2016 Republican nomination for president. Mr. Walker, who has been all but officially running for president for months, is scheduled make âan announcementâ on Monday afternoon in Wisconsin about whether he will seek the White House. Fridayâs tweet said, âScott is in. Are you? Join our team todayâ with a photo of Mr. Walker that features the words âSCOTT WALKER IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.â Mr. Walker usually signs his personal tweets with his initials, but âSKWâ is not on this one. Scott is in. Are you? Join our team today. pic.twitter.com/JueJJKDdCt — Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) July 10, 2015  Asked if the tweet constituted an official announcement, a spokeswoman for Mr. Walker replied by e-mail, âStay tuned for Governor Walkerâs announcement on Monday at 5pm CT.â On Friday night, a Twitter spokesman emailed a statement to media outlets saying that the tweet had not been caused by the Walker campaign. “We’re looking into today’s issue, and we’ve determined the Walker team was not at fault,” said the spokesman, Nu Wexler. He said he had no further information about how the tweet had been sent out.
