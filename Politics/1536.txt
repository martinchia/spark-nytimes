Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is meeting Thursday with Richard L. Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., a person briefed on the get-together confirmed. The agenda for the meeting, to be held at the vice president’s official residence at the Naval Observatory, was unclear. But it came at Mr. Biden’s request, according to the person briefed, and it will take place as the vice president is seriously considering whether to run for president in the 2016 campaign. Mr. Trumka, who has promoted Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in national political talk, has been among those urging labor leaders to hold off on endorsements as the nominating process plays out. Mr. Biden met with Ms. Warren over the weekend. Mr. Trumka has urged Hillary Rodham Clinton to be more vocal about issues related to income inequality.
