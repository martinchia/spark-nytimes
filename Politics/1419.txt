DES MOINES â When Senator Ted Cruz speaks to as many as 2,000 conservatives at a Rally for Religious Liberty on Friday night, he will feature on stage Iowaâs equivalent of the Christian bakers and florists who became cause célèbres by refusing to provide services for same-sex weddings. Richard and Betty Odgaard, a Mennonite couple who would not rent their event space for a gay wedding in 2013, incurring a $5,000 fine from the Iowa Civil Rights Commission, have had their cause taken up by Mr. Cruz as he seeks support from Iowaâs many evangelical voters. Mr. Cruz, the Texas Republican, has blamed âliberal fascismâ for driving the Odgaards out of business. The couple closed their cafe, gallery and event space, the Gortz Haus, in January. They said business steeply declined after they decided not to hold any weddings rather than risk another fine. Iowa law since 2007 has forbidden discrimination based on sexual orientation in public accommodations.  A conservative Iowa talk radio host, Steve Deace, who announced his endorsement of Mr. Cruz this week, has urged every Republican presidential candidate to make household names of the Odgaards as victims of bullying by âthe Rainbow jihad.ââ In interviews, the Odgaards come across as a sympathetic elderly couple, but civil rights experts said they were on porous legal grounds. âI have nothing against gays and lesbians. Nothing,â Betty Odgaard told The Des Moines Register in 2013. âI just personally believe that a marriage is between one man and one woman. I donât condemn or judge anybody else for their beliefs and how they live their life.â Bob Vander Plaats, an influential political leader of social conservatives in Iowa, said the Odgaards provided Mr. Cruz with a potent symbol to win evangelical support. âThis isnât about live and let live,ââ he said. âThis is believe the way I want you to believe or go out of business.ââ  But the issue of âreligious libertyâ has proved of limited appeal outside states with many religious conservatives.    When Republican lawmakers in Indiana and Arkansas tried to protect businesses this year from mandates about same-sex weddings that might violate their faith, the backlash was severe, and both states retreated.  Turning away a gay couple from a business is no different than denying service based on skin color or religion, civil rights activists said.  âA church and religious institution has the right to discriminate; it can decide who it give the sacraments of baptism, marriage and burial to,ââ said Donna Red Wing, executive director of One Iowa, a gay rights group.  âBut a venue open to the public cannot.ââ James D. Esseks, director of the gay rights project for the American Civil Liberties Union, said, âPeople canât put up a sign that says âNo gay people allowed.â They canât put up a sign saying ‘We donât serve Mennonites.’ââ Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
