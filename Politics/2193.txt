Good Tuesday morning. Cameras and microphones flocked to Donald J. Trump on Monday as he fulfilled his civic responsibilities and reported for jury duty in Manhattan. But it is his strict immigration proposals that continue to gain widespread attention and expose tension in the party over which crucial voting bloc is best to alienate and upset: Mr. Trump’s already angry supporters or Hispanics. Republicans were hoping to leave their immigration woes behind, but six months before the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Trump has made that impossible. By articulating his policy of rounding up immigrants and building a big wall, Mr. Trump has forced the party to talk about immigration in the terms of its most ardent activists. So much for Republicans wooing Hispanic voters with a more moderate tone. âChasing extremists on immigration to win the primary will end the Republican Party’s ability to win the general election in 2016, and it will destroy the party,â said Kica Matos, a spokeswoman for the Fair Immigration Reform Movement. âIf you alienate the fastest-growing voting block in the country you cannot win today, and you cannot survive tomorrow.” Conservatives walk a tightrope in both directions, running the risk of upsetting their base by breaking too far from Mr. Trump, who leads in the polls. But a Gallup survey this month found that just 31 percent of Republicans favor deporting all illegal immigrants â as Mr. Trump wants to do. The tension in the party was evident on Monday when Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said that Mr. Trumpâs plan to build a wall âdidnât make any senseâ and when Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin echoed Mr. Trumpâs support for ending birthright citizenship, suggesting to Iowans that he had inspired much of Mr. Trumpâs overall plan. On Monday evening, Lorella Praeli, the America Latino outreach director for Hillary Rodham Clintonâs campaign, released a statement linking Mr. Walker to Mr. Trump, and both of them to the rest of the party. âIt is disturbing that Republican presidential candidates continue to embrace extreme anti-immigrant positions as core pieces of their immigration platform,â Ms. Praeli said. As Mrs. Clinton heads to Nevada on Tuesday to meet with members of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., she will most likely be eager to resume the debate. â Alan Rappeport Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. Jeb Bush will attend a national security forum in South Carolina hosted by Americans for Peace, Prosperity and Security. Mr. Bush, who has been lagging in the polls despite his presumed front-runner status when he entered the race, regained some national attention with recent speeches linking the rise of the Islamic State to the policies of President Obama and Mrs. Clinton‘s tenure as secretary of state. The Des Moines Register’s Soapbox continues as Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio take their turn with the bipartisan, and sometimes vocal, crowd at the Iowa State Fair. And Mrs. Clinton‘s appearance before labor leaders in Nevada is the latest round in the Democratic fight for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s endorsement, which the group has hinted it will take its time announcing â a seeming effort for leverage to influence the eventual Democratic nomineeâs policy positions. Mr. Walker, who is seeking to re-enter the national conversation after slipping poll numbers and a lackluster outing in the first Republican debate, will tackle a subject on Tuesday that many of his rivals have so far ducked: a detailed replacement for Mr. Obamaâs health care plan. In a speech in Minnesota, Mr. Walker plans to take aim at the Republican-controlled Congress for failing to âput a bill on President Obamaâs desk to repeal Obamacare,ââ according to a preview of his remarks. Still, many who follow Republican proposals for replacing the Affordable Care Act will find the details of Mr. Walkerâs Patient Freedom Plan familiar. It eliminates the individual mandate to buy health insurance and gives individuals tax credits to buy coverage, up to $3,000 for someone over 50. It allows plans to be sold across state lines. It promises tort reform. Mr. Walker would revamp two of the Affordable Care Actâs most popular features: Instead of requiring insurance companies to allow people up to 26 years old to stay on their parentsâ plans, states would decide the matter; and instead of a prohibition on insurers discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions, Mr. Walker would give federal aid to states for high-risk pools. He would pay for his own plan by lowering the cost of Medicaid, largely by turning it into a block grant to states, and by ending the tax deduction for costly employer-provided plans. An issue Mr. Walker does not address: How many of the estimated 16.5 million people who gained coverage under the law would lose it under repeal, and how many would be covered under the Walker proposals? â Trip Gabriel Though Mr. Trump‘s immigration plan stretched the boundaries of previous conservative platforms, some of his proposals are based on assertions that have been broadly debunked. Mr. Kasich is seen as a moderate in the Republicansâ rambunctious field of candidates, but the governor of one of the country’s most conservative states, Robert Bentley of Alabama, gave him his endorsement on Monday, providing a potential boon to Mr. Kasich’s perceived bona fides. And Senator Ted Cruz of Texas’s team has confirmed the identity of a previously mysterious megadonor: Ben Nash, the chief executive of PCS Wireless, who donated $250,000 to the Stand for Principle PAC tied to Mr. Cruz. With August past its midpoint, Senate Republicans are stepping up the pressure on Democrats in advance of the September debate over the Iran nuclear agreement. And not just on the Democrats currently serving in the Senate. “Will These Democrats Side With President Obama or the American People?” asked the headline of a news statement issued on Monday by the National Republican Senatorial Committee. In addition to three House members seeking Senate seats in Florida and Illinois, the release singles out other potential Democratic Senate challengers, including Ted Strickland in Ohio and Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada, and accuses them of being evasive on the Iran deal. The Republicans also pointedly note that Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the presumed leader of the next crop of Senate Democrats, has come out against the deal. The Democratic Senate contenders say they are still studying the deal, and they seem in no hurry to go public with their views despite Republican attempts to smoke out even the Democrats who wonât have to vote on the deal. But the push by Republicans is evidence that they see their virtually united opposition to the Iran agreement as a political winner and that they intend to make the issue central to the 2016 Senate campaign season. â Carl Hulse Following the declared hopes of congressional Republicans, officials in some Republican states are moving to cut public funding for Planned Parenthood or to investigate it in response to videos claiming that it profits from fetal tissue sales. Mrs. Clinton, who is having some difficulty overcoming the perception that she is unapproachable on the campaign trail, is also widening her embrace of donations from “super PACs”: Her focus on campaign finance overhaul has snagged on the financial gap between her campaign and those of Republicans raising vast sums through the outside groups. In an interview with The New York Times magazine, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont discussed the Black Lives Matter movement, Mr. Trump‘s ascent, and his “elevator pitch for Socialism.” And on Room for Debate, a Times Editorial Department blog, college students discuss the issues that matter most to them this elections season, including climate change, jobs and, of course, student debt. The text message has suddenly become a go-to tactic for candidates when they need to cut through the noise online and reach supporters quickly and directly. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, The Associated Press writes, has pledged to contribute $450,000 to finance a proposed switch in the state from a primary to a caucus system, a move that would “allow Paul to run for president and re-election to his U.S. Senate seat simultaneously without violating a state law banning candidates from appearing on the ballot twice.” Writing for CNN, Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor, offered a plan to address the cholera epidemic in Haiti, arguing that the United Nations should acknowledge its role in the outbreak â it has been tied to peacekeeping troops â and that “the United States must assume a greater leadership role in our own hemisphere.” And Mr. Cruz has “dispatched” a campaign operative to Guam, The Guardian reports, to try and secure the territory’s nine delegates. Reports of possible presidential candidacies by Al Gore and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. are just reflective of the desire among reporters for a candidate who can “hypnotize the press,” Politico says. Mr. Trump‘s immigration plan is getting some praise on the left for seeking to expand the H-1B visa program to help skilled foreign workers stay in the United States, Breitbart.com reports.
