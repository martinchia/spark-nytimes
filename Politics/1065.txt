PhotoSenator Ted Cruz of Texas closed a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa on Saturday in the town of Waverly.Credit Eric Thayer for The New York Times Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016âs first proper bus tour. EVENT 28 Time: 7:58 p.m., Jan. 9 Place: Waverly, Iowa (population: 9,874) Site: Wartburg College, in a midsize auditorium filled well beyond seating capacity for the trip’s final stop. Mood: last class before winter break Psychology: When Mr. Cruz delivered a typical stump speech prediction â that hordes of journalists would require therapy during a Cruz administration â an attendee turned to the assembled news media. âThat you guys?â he asked, nudging two reporters. Economics: Mr. Cruz has taken care in recent days to highlight his relative youth. During an answer on the struggles of young adults, he noted his own student debt experience. âBy the way, I paid off my student loans about six years ago,â said Mr. Cruz, who is 45. âSo this is not ancient history to me.” Assignment: Mr. Cruz, closing his speech, made his standard final pitch, asking attendees to do three things: Vote for him. Volunteer. And pray, for at least a minute daily, until the caucuses on Feb. 1. Highlight: Greeting reporters for the final time this week, Mr. Cruz suggested an immediate sequel. âIâm tempted to announce that weâre going to launch another six days and 28 counties starting tomorrow,â he said. âBut Iâm afraid yâall would take your cameras and beat me over the head.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
