Pollsters tend to be cut and dry in their analyses of how candidates are faring, but Monmouth University made a point on Tuesday of kicking one lagging Democratic presidential candidate while he is down. Lincoln Chafee, the former Rhode Island governor, has failed to garner a single supporter in the last four national polls, which have queried a total of 1,475 Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters. The latest poll came after Mr. Chafee got free publicity from Conan OâBrien, the comedian who began a âGet Lincoln Chafee to 1%â campaign on his television show in August. Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, addressed the comedian’s efforts in the poll’s analysis: âSorry, Team Coco,â he wrote, using a nickname for Mr. O’Brien and his fans. âYou failed: Maybe you should think about switching to Jim Gilmore,â Mr. Murray wrote, referring to another candidate, a Republican, who is failing to register. If Mr. Chafee were to reach the 1 percent threshold, it would place him in a three-way tie with Mr. OâMalley and former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia. Mr. Chafeeâs campaign had little explanation for his lack of support in the Monmouth polls, but Debbie Rich, a spokeswoman for the candidate, said that he had been âwell receivedâ at appearances in Iowa and New Hampshire. âIf there’s any accuracy to the Monmouth poll, it looks like O’Malley, Webb and Chafee still have more work to do,â Ms. Rich said.
