Chris Christie is struggling to make the cut for the first Republican debate, but the New Jersey governor has plenty of friends to help him out. Records filed by America Leads, a “super PAC” supporting Mr. Christie, showed the group raised $11 million, much of it from a handful of families and companies. The largest single check came from Winecup-Gamble, a Nevada-based corporation controlled by Paul Fireman. Mr. Fireman, a former executive of Reebok who is now runs a Boston-based venture capital firm, has proposed building a $4 billion casino resort in New Jersey, which would require state approval. But a single family, the billionaire investor Steve Cohen and his wife, Alexandra, contributed more in total, writing checks worth $2.25 million to America Leads. Rex Sinquefield, a wealthy retired investor who is a huge force in Missouri politics, provided $250,000. Other donors included some longtime backers of Mr. Christie: Stan Druckenmiller, a New York investor, put in $100,000, while Ken Langone, the Home Depot co-founder, contributed $250,000.
