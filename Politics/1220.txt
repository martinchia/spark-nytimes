President Obama pleaded with progressive organizations on Thursday to fight against a vast lobbying campaign intended to derail the recent diplomatic accord over Iranâs nuclear program. âThe facts are on our side,â Mr. Obama said in an evening conference call. âIâve never been more certain about a policy decision than this one right here, but the politics are going to be tough if all of you donât get active.â He said that one of his frustrations leading up to the Iraq war was that those opposed to the conflict failed to make their voices heard until well after it was too late. He urged the groups not to make the same mistake. âThe lobbying that is taking place on the other side is fierce, it is well financed, and it is relentless,â he said. The call was part of what has become one of the most aggressive legislative sales jobs that Mr. Obama has undertaken as president. On Wednesday, he gave an intensive seminar in the East Room of the White House to about 90 House Democrats on the most important details of the deal. When the lawmakers were called away to vote on other legislation before they could ask questions, he invited them back that night. About two dozen lawmakers returned and spent nearly two more hours discussing the deal with the president. Mr. Obama has promised to make himself available to any member of Congress who has questions. But on Thursday, Mr. Obama said the pressure on Washington’s lawmakers had become intense. âI can tell when they start getting squishy,â he said. âYou guys have to counteract that with the facts,â Mr. Obama said. âUltimately, the truth will win out as long as you guys are helping to carry it.â
