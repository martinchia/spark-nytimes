President Obama will kick off the new year â his final year in office â on Tuesday with executive actions on guns that are already causing a stir on the campaign trail. In a formal East Room ceremony, Mr. Obama will take unilateral action on gun control in the face of congressional gridlock. He will try to expand background checks on some gun purchases and will bolster the federal enforcement of gun laws. The actions are more modest than those Congress considered, and rejected, in 2013. But Republican candidates wasted no time in denouncing the presidentâs expected actions as an abuse of power. Donald J. Trump said Monday on CNN that âpretty soon, you wonât be able to get guns.â Over the weekend, Mr. Trump had vowed at a rally: âI will veto. I will unsign that so fast.â Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey told Fox News on Sunday that Mr. Obama was acting like a king or a dictator, adding that âthis is going to be another illegal executive action, which Iâm sure will be rejected by the courts, and when I become president, will be stricken from executive action by executive action I will take.â Jeb Bush said that Mr. Obama was recklessly using authority that he does not have and infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens. âItâs wrong,â Mr. Bush said on the same Fox News program. âTo use executive power that he doesnât have is a pattern that is quite dangerous.â For her part, Hillary Clinton said in a statement that she âapplaudedâ Mr. Obama for taking action on guns, and she warned that a Republican president would seek to overturn the president’s moves. White House officials dismissed Republican concerns about the presidentâs legal powers, saying that the actions he is taking are well within his authority. Mr. Obama will be flanked by gun control activists and families of the victims of gun violence when he announces the actions on Tuesday.
