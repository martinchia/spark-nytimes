A tax-exempt group formed by allies of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said on Monday that it was preparing to spend upward of $20 million on issue advertising, money whose source the group is not required to disclose. The organization, the Conservative Solutions Project, said it had raised $15.8 million from donors since it was established last year, more than two Republican contenders, Ben Carson and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, have said they have raised for their actual campaigns. The group said it had spent $3.3 million on television and radio advertising, with early spots focusing on Mr. Rubioâs attacks on the Obama administrationâs proposed nuclear deal with Iran â a critical issue for some of the most generous Republican donors. While the group has said it is not devoted to any one candidate, it shares a name and some staff with a âsuper PACâ supporting Mr. Rubioâs campaign. The announcement suggested that Mr. Rubio is the biggest beneficiary so far of a new and largely untested means for moving unlimited cash into presidential primary campaigns. As during the 2012 campaign, many Republican contenders have dispatched aides to form ostensibly independent super PACs to raise and spend unlimited money on their behalf, shifting costs like advertising and polling away from their campaigns. But this time, many candidates, including Mr. Rubio, have also blessed the creation of nonprofits known as 501(c)4 organizations. The Conservative Solutions Project has already conducted many activities that would normally be carried out by a formal presidential campaign, including extensive research on the Republican primary electorate. Because the group was founded more than a year ago, well before Mr. Rubio began traveling the country in preparation to run for president, officials there could have spent months collaborating with him and dividing up future responsibilities. The nonprofit groups are technically supposed to be devoted to promoting what the Internal Revenue Service calls âsocial welfare,â rather than candidates. But the rules governing how much social welfare groups can engage in campaigns are unclear, and strategists have begun to use them in place of or alongside super PACs. The most important difference: Unlike the super PAC backing Mr. Rubio, the Conservative Solutions Project is not required to disclose who is providing the money. A spokesman said they were unlikely to do so voluntarily. âWe look forward to complying with all of the rules that apply to 501(c)4s,â said Jeff Sadosky, the spokesman. Alex Conant, a spokesman for Mr. Rubio, declined to say whether the senator thought the group should disclose who was paying for the advertisements. Instead, he deflected the question, saying only that Mr. Rubio believed that nonprofit organizations have âa right to free speech.â Nonprofit groups have emerged as a force in campaigns, and the I.R.S. is preparing rules â not expected until after the 2016 elections â to define more clearly what social welfare groups can spend on politics. Advocates, chiefly on the right, have attacked those proposals, arguing that any effort to regulate the groupsâ political spending, or require the kind of disclosure that applies to candidates, would be an attack on free speech. One of the most outspoken critics of further I.R.S. regulation has been Cleta Mitchell, a conservative election lawyer with ties to Tea Party groups. Ms. Mitchell has called for a more sweeping investigation of the agencyâs handling of the tax exemption applications of Tea Party groups. According to tax returns filed in March, Ms. Mitchell has served as the secretary of the board of the Conservative Solutions Project.   A version of this article appears in print on 07/07/2015, on page A12 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Nonprofit Group Tied to Rubio Raises Millions While Shielding Donors .
