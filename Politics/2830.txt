Donald J. Trump brought his free-association presidential campaign to Greenville, S.C.,  on Thursday, following up a cavalier reference to the âsilent majorityâ that supports him with an annotated reading of a New York Times front-page article about him and then with an invitation to a woman in the crowd to yank his hair (âI donât wear a toupee — itâs my hairâ). Mr. Trump then moved on to discussion about how terrible a candidate Jeb Bush is, about how he has the appropriate energy level to be president (âWe need tough toneâ) about how âbeautifulâ the wall that he wants to build on the Mexican border will be, and — for his South Carolina audience — about how their senator, Lindsey Graham, is stuck at zero in the presidential  polls while âeven Patakiâ — George, the former New York governor — had âan arrow that was pointing up.â At a certain point, Mr. Trump also talked about the beauty of the Qatar airport, before adding, to the bewilderment of many in the crowd, a reference to a New York airport.  “I’m thinking La Guardia oy yoy yoy,” he said.
