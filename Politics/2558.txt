Donald J. Trump on Wednesday called the lawyer who took out a breast pump in front him during a 2011 deposition a âvicious, horrible person,â even as he acknowledged his angry response to the incident. Legal papers that are not in dispute describe Mr. Trump as telling the lawyer, Elizabeth Beck, âyouâre disgusting,â after she requested a break from questioning him to pump breast milk for her 3-month-old daughter. âI might have said, âThatâs disgusting,ââ Mr. Trump said in an interview with CNN, his first remarks about the episode, which was reported Tuesday night by The New York Times. But Mr. Trump denied losing his temper. âI don’t blow up,â he told CNN. âShe made it up.â Letters exchanged between Ms. Beck’s husband and co-counsel, Jared Beck, and a lawyer for Mr. Trump make clear that Mr. Trump became upset when Ms. Beck took out the breast pump.  Ms. Beck has said that she took the pump out to illustrate how urgently she needed to stop the deposition and only after Mr. Trump objected to her request to take a one-hour break. None of the lawyers involved have suggested that Ms. Beck did anything more than take out the pump. But Mr. Trump, in his interview with CNN, went further. âShe wanted to pump in front of me,â he said.  âShe wanted to breast pump in front of me.â In an interview with the Times after the CNN segment aired, Ms. Beck called Mr. Trumpâs assertion âjust a lie.â She recalled pumping breast milk throughout that week of depositions in 2011 and said she never once did it in front of either fellow lawyers or the people she was deposing in the case. As for Mr. Trumpâs descriptions of her, Ms. Beck said: âI donât think his opinion of me is important. Iâm not the one running for president.â She added: âThe question is, How does he behave in a situation that is contentious and uncomfortable? Can he act with grace under fire or does he have a meltdown?â Ms. Beck continued. âWhy does a breast pump make him have a fit? What other contraptions are out there that would make this man have a fit? Iâd like to know.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
