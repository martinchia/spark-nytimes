Jeb Bush waded into the politics of professional football this week and was hit by Native American groups on Wednesday for saying that the Washington Redskins was not an offensive team name. The issue has been a divisive one in Washington and in Congress as the N.F.L. and the franchise have come under pressure from some Native Americans who say the name is racist and demand that it be changed. In an interview with Sirius XM’s POTUS channel, Mr. Bush said that he had no problem with the name and that the debate was overblown. “I don’t think it should change it,” Mr. Bush said. “I don’t find it offensive.” Mr. Bush went on to explain that he faced a similar issue when he was the governor of Florida and questions arose about Florida State University’s nickname, the Seminoles, and recalled that members of the Seminole tribe in his state supported the university in keeping the name. In 2005 the N.C.A.A. banned Native American mascots in postseason tournaments amid pressure from civil rights groups. “How politically correct can you get?” Mr. Bush said at the time, opposing the mascot ban. “The folks that make these decisions need to get out more often.” Political correctness has been a hot topic in the Republican presidential campaign this year as Donald J. Trump has taken a hard line on immigration and used phrases such as “anchor babies” to describe children born to immigrants who come to the United States illegally. Mr. Bush, who has struck a more tolerant tone toward immigrants, surprised some when he also used the term “anchor babies” and said it was acceptable. But Change the Mascot, an advocacy group that represents Native American tribes, took issue with Mr. Bush’s comments on Wednesday. “What is surprising is that in promoting the use of this slur, the governor somehow believes he speaks for Native Americans and can assert that Native American people do not find this slur offensive,” the group said in a statement. Change the Mascot also suggested that Mr. Bush’s position might be related to his ties to the owner of the Redskins, Dan Synder. According to a Federal Election Commission filing, Mr. Snyder donated $100,000 this year to Right to Rise, the super PAC that supports Mr. Bush. Democrats also condemned Mr. Bushâs acceptance of the name. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, said it was an âextremely insultingâ racial slur and predicted the Mr. Bush’s position would hurt his prospects of earning the Native American vote. Mr. Bush did say in the Sirius interview that the debate should not be decided by politicians. “It’s a sport, for crying out loud — it’s a football team,” he said. “I’m missing something here, I guess.” Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
