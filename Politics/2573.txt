On the eve of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s speech at the Democratic National Committee summer meeting on Friday, her campaign released four memos from the first voting states that detail the deep networks she has built in each one.  The four “state of the race” memos are a jumble of numbers and factoids from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.  They outline the contours of months of organizational effort, a campaign foundation that is stronger than the one she built in 2008. But the memos, coming amid the looming possibility of a campaign by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., are more than a reminder to any anxious Democrats about the depth of her operation: They are also a blinking warning sign to Mr. Biden’s supporters. For instance, the Iowa memo says that the campaign has been “engaging volunteers earlyâ and âis now able to grow and do outreach to an increasing number of Iowans every day.â Citing a âvolunteer leadership model from previous campaigns,â the team âcontinues to empower volunteers that were identified early on in the campaign. They are now phonebank and canvass captains or engagement directors who are reaching out to new members of the community and will be critical to building the structure needed to win the caucus.”  The Iowa memo also notes that Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, a former governor of the state, has endorsed Mrs. Clinton â the first member of the Obama administration to do so, a gesture many saw as timed to Mr. Biden’s considerations.  Her current closest challenger, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has drawn large crowds to his rallies, but it remains to be seen whether he can convert that energy and his low-dollar donor base into a sturdy organization for the early states and beyond. In South Carolina, the state memo says, more than 10,000 people have signed commitment cards. “Through half a dozen town halls and forums, Hillary Clinton has made it a priority to listen to the concerns of South Carolinians,” the memo states. “Many of her ideas have come directly from the Palmetto State on issues like investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and technical schools, growing our apprenticeship programs, and strengthening and expanding programs that serve rural communities with high poverty rates.”
