Good Monday morning from Washington, where candidates are recovering from a working weekend of holiday parades and rope lines. Financial disclosures continue to trickle in amid a focus on outside fund-raising groups, but the trail gives way this week to Vienna, where negotiators report progress but also great distance over crucial elements of a deal to curtail Iran’s nuclear program. Time is running short for the United States and Iran to reach a nuclear agreement as Republican lawmakers raise increasingly strong warnings about the deal. Gathered in Vienna, negotiators were still at odds on multiple outstanding points two days before the countriesâ self-imposed Tuesday deadline, and Secretary of State John Kerry said it was not a sure thing that a final agreement could be achieved despite indications from the Iranian side that a compromise over its nuclear abilities was within reach. At the same time, Senator Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, reiterated his concern that Mr. Kerry and the Obama administration were more interested in coming to terms with Iran for the sake of a legacy-burnishing diplomatic success than in imposing the most stringent requirements possible on Iran. Appearing on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, Mr. Corker also ticked off elements of an agreement that Republicans would be looking for if and when it reached Capitol Hill: Will the agreement allow “anytime, anywhere” inspections of Iranian facilities, and will there be an assessment and acknowledgment of the previous military aspects of Iran’s nuclear program? He suggested that the administration was rushing to a meet the deadline and deliver a deal to Congress by Thursday to limit the House and Senate’s review time to 30 days rather than the 60 days lawmakers would be allowed if the negotiations ran longer. Administration allies said they expected a deal given the significant White House investment. If Congress does review an agreement, Mr. Obama will find the Republicans a much tougher sell than he did during his recent trade victory.

The campaign trail was busy last week in the buildup to the holiday, with much of the field concentrated in Iowa. Though things will slow down a little this week, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has been gaining steadily on Hillary Rodham Clinton in the polls and who drew a crowd of about 10,000 at a rally in Madison, Wis., on Wednesday, will hold a town-hall-style meeting on Monday in Portland, Maine.On the Republican side, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina will be in New Hampshire.Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who is pinning his election strategy on New Hampshire and was there for several days last week after announcing his candidacy, will return to New Jersey. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas will attend a book signing in Iowa on Monday, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will be in the state for several days this week. And President Obama will speak to the news media in the afternoon after receiving a briefing over efforts to defeat the Islamic State in the Middle East. When Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush meet on Monday at the Bush compound in Maine, it will be the product of an invitation Mr. Bush extended about two months ago. Mr. Bush said over the weekend, as he was taking part in Fourth of July festivities in New Hampshire, that he had invited Mr. Romney and his wife, Ann, to come to Kennebunkport sometime around the holiday weekend to spend time with him, his wife and his parents, former President George Bush and Barbara Bush. Mr. Bush and Mr. Romney last met, in private, in Utah months ago, when Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, was considering making a third run for the White House. In private conversations with friends, he has spoken dimly of Mr. Bush’s ability to withstand the scrutiny that comes with running for president. Mr. Bush has been critical of the race Mr. Romney ran. But with reporters on Saturday, he offered nothing but praise. “I wish he was president of the United States,” he said, even if that would have made his own campaign virtually impossible. — Maggie Haberman and Patrick Healy Mrs. Clinton‘s campaign received the kind of attention no political team wants, after photos spread on Twitter of journalists â including this one â being separated from her with a length of rope as she marched in a parade on Saturday. The images of the journalists being pulled at times by the moving rope line were discussed on the Sunday news shows. It is never desirable for reporters to be part of a story, but Mrs. Clintonâs proximity to the makeshift corral, which was reinforced by her Secret Service agents, helped draw attention to it. Reporters could see Mrs. Clinton but often couldn’t hear exchanges as she briskly walked the parade, followed by supporters and a parallel band of a half-dozen protesters shouting loudly. “As we’ve said, we want a happy press corps,” Mrs. Clinton’s spokesman, Nick Merrill, said in a statement on Sunday. “We also have to balance that with facilitating our candidateâs ability to talk to voters,” he said. “As to Saturday, we wanted to accommodate the press so they could be right there in the street with the parade. That became too disruptive to the parade, so we asked people to keep a very short distance behind a rope.” Mrs. Clinton’s aides said immediately after the parade that they wanted her to be seen and to be able to meet people along the route. A press scrum around Mrs. Clinton, who is often followed by dozens of photographers, would have prevented that, they said. People involved in her 2008 run and her 2000 Senate campaign say a rope was used to cordon off reporters at times in those races, as well. Mr. Merrill would not say whether the campaign would use a rope at future events. — Maggie Haberman Despite Mr. Rubio‘s family roots in Cuba, residents in towns where his parents, grandparents and great-grandparents lived take issue with his Cuba policy. Greek voters decisively rejected an extension of a European bailout tied to austerity measures, a move that could redefine the nation’s place in Europe and strain international markets. And as presidential candidates find new ways to exploit secret donations from tax-exempt groups, hobbled regulators at the Internal Revenue Service appear certain to delay trying to curb widespread abuses at nonprofits until after the 2016 election.In a shift from past elections, at least eight Republican presidential candidates, including leading contenders like Mr. Bush and Mr. Rubio, have aligned with nonprofit groups set up to raise hundreds of millions of dollars. Mrs. Clintonâs supporters are considering a similar tactic. Mr. Sanders‘s success, The Wall Street Journal writes, is overshadowing Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland who had hoped to present himself as a liberal alternative to Mrs. Clinton. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., whose court Mr. Christie criticized on Sunday over its decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage, might be beyond redemption for some conservatives, The Washington Times writes. And before Donald J. Trump began to see growing fallout over his words about immigrants living in the country illegally, he had angered Neil Young by using Mr. Young’s song “Rockin’ in the Free World” at his official campaign announcement. “Theme song headaches,” NPR reports, are an ailment for which candidates can blame Michael Jackson. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who is expected to announce his presidential run next week, is hoping his appeal in the Midwest will propel him to the nomination, which Politico says is a risky strategy. Mr. Christie wants the news media to move past his George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal, and even asks reporters to apologize for covering it, The Washington Post reports. The newsletter on Thursday misidentified the city in Wisconsin where Mr. Obama was to deliver a speech on the economy. It was La Crosse, not Madison. Like the Politics Newsletter?
