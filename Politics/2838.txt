Mr. Trump, a Republican presidential candidate, vowed to back the partyâs choice if he failed to win the nomination, ruling out an independent or third-party bid. He said yes. Donald J. Trump on Thursday signed a Republican Party pledge demanding that all of its presidential candidates promise to forgo a third-party run and support the eventual nominee. And he did not do so quietly, instead holding a deeply theatrical and meandering news conference. With dozens of people standing behind him holding signs with his slogan, “Make America Great Again!” (and one referring to the Nixonian phrase “the silent majority”), Mr. Trump addressed skepticism about his true intentions, saying, “I see no circumstances under which I would tear up that pledge.” More than 30 reporters, photographers and camera operators, some of whom who had been waiting for hours, were packed into seats at the event, which was closed to the public. When Mr. Trump stepped out of his gleaming gold elevator in Trump Tower in New York, he held up his hand as staff members roused up the crowd with a cheer. What did he get in exchange for his signature? “I got nothing,” he said, sounding somewhat like Marlon Brando at the beginning of “The Godfather.” “I really got nothing, absolutely nothing other than the assurance” that he would be treated fairly, Mr. Trump said. His appearance followed a meeting with Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, who is also obtaining the signature of Mr. Trump’s 16 party rivals for the nomination.  And why, Mr. Trump was asked, wasn’t Mr. Priebus appearing with him at the news conference? (That would have looked like an endorsement, Mr. Trump insisted, saying he urged the party chairman to avoid it.) But the optics of the event were clear: The head of the Republican Party had come to Mr. Trump’s flashy office in Midtown Manhattan, a tribute unlikely to be accorded the other candidates. One reporter asked about Chris Christie calling Mr. Trump self-obsessed and pointing out that Mr. Priebus didn’t give the same respect to the New Jersey governor for his signature. Almost guffawing, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Christie’s polling, saying, “You don’t have to be met when you’re at 2 percent.” Oh, he added, as reporters laughed, “I like Governor Christie, by the way.” Mr. Trump’s harshest words were, as usual, reserved for Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, who Mr. Trump said is about to begin airing tens of millions of dollars of attack ads against him. (Actually, officials with the “super PAC” backing Mr. Bush have strenuously resisted doing that.) Mr. Trump mocked super PACs, saying he had turned away “millions” of dollars that people wanted to give him. (In fact, Mr. Trump himself has a super PAC, whose supporters have been sending email pleas to prospective donors for money.) His voice rising, Mr. Trump said he took pleasure in the fact that “everybody that’s attacked me has gone down the tubes.” And then he ticked off the list of such rivals. He questioned why Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has been plummeting in polls, would still likely be allowed on the main CNN debate stage this month after the cable news network changed the criteria for picking candidates, likely admitting Carly Fiorina to the pack, and suggested that the event would still be too crowded with 11 people. But threaded through the skewering of his rivals and his discussion of poll numbers were signs of a new restraint and a new level of polish; Mr. Trump, a first-time candidate, seems to have tempered his performance since he entered the race in June. He declined to answer a question about barely dressed women who have recently created a furor by parading around Times Square, calling it “inappropriate” to discuss at a news conference. He declined to say whether he would pardon I. Lewis Libby Jr., known as Scooter, who was convicted for lying about his role in the outing of Valerie Plame Wilson as a covert C.I.A. agent during the George W. Bush administration, calling it an irrelevant issue. Immigration, he said, “can be a positive” issue. He refused to chime in on the case of Kim Davis, the county clerk in Kentucky who was ordered jailed on Thursday for refusing to issue marriage licenses to gay couples, saying he didn’t know enough about it. Still, there were points at which Mr. Trump couldn’t resist swinging. What about Kanye West, who announced at the MTV Video Music Awards this week that he planned to run for president in 2020, which may or not be true? “I’ll never say anything bad about him, you know why? Because he loves Trump!”   On Thursday, Donald Trump signed a pledge to support the eventual Republican presidential nominee, weeks after saying he wouldnât. Not everyone agreed with his change of heart.
