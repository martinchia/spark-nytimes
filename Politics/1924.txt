Good Debate Day morning. As the Republican candidates prepare for their second showdown,Â a New York Times/CBS pollÂ showsÂ that the partyâs primary and caucus voters increasingly thinkÂ thatÂ Donald J. TrumpÂ has the best chance of winning the general election. The poll results could give the other candidates further reason to direct their attack plans toward him, starting, perhaps, tonight.Â  The Gang of 11 will take the stage at the Republican presidential debate, an event that may winnow the field and, potentially, shake it up. Heading into the prime-time event hosted by CNN at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., Mr. Trump remains the candidate to beat. Will he be able to extend his Teflon streak, in which no argument against him seems to have stuck? Or will someone dent the veneer of his impenetrability? Jeb Bush, who will once again stand immediately to Mr. Trumpâs left, surely knows that he must improve on his lackluster performance in the Fox News debate last month. His top advisers spent a day briefing donors in Manhattan last week, arming them with talking points and soothing their concerns. But Mr. Bush has struggled to be the change he wants to see, first ignoring Mr. Trump during his effort to be a joyful warrior and then finally acknowledging the need to punch back. Ben Carson, whoÂ is right behind Mr. TrumpÂ in the newest Times/CBS poll, is likely to tap into the same lower-wattage speaking style that helped him in the last debate. But many others on the stage will need a breakout performance.Â Gov. John R. Kasich of OhioÂ will need to keep his momentum going. And Carly Fiorina, who was granted a podium on the main stage after the debate rules were changed, will need to do more than outshine Mr. Trump in insults. Many of the others will simply need to remind viewers that they exist. With most eyes on Mr. Trump, thatâs no small feat.

A Diminished Warm-Up Act Still Holds Opportunities For the candidates left out of the main debate and relegated to a warm-up act, the struggle to maintain dignity is likely to be visible, possibly even painful. This time there are only four in the so-called undercard debate. Three who were on stage at the first debate are gone: Two were cut in a game of musical chairs (Rick Perry, who quit the race, and Jim Gilmore, whose polling was so low that CNN ejected him). The third, Mrs. Fiorina, was promoted to the main event, in itself a kind of humiliation for the others who were not. To be sure, there are some improvements over the first debate. The early squad, which will face off at 6 p.m. Eastern time, will have a live audience instead of the empty hall they had the first time. They will share a moderator with the 11 candidates in the 8 p.m. debate, Jake Tapper of CNN. Also on the plus side, the four will have plenty of time to be heard. âDo you want to be in the 8 oâclock debate on the wing, or center state at 6 oâclock?ââ said Matt Beynon, communications manager for Rick Santorum, who will occupy one of the two central podiums in the early evening. The other is claimed by Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. Flanking them will be George E. Pataki and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. In CNNâs polling average since the first debate, none of the four were above 1 percent. The biggest question may be whether anyone leaves an impression based on his own policies and personality â or whether their most repeatable lines will be attacks on Mr. Trump. â Trip Gabriel An Inquisitor Prepares Fiorina Says Trump Will âBe Hearing Quite a Lot From Meâ What Else Weâre Watching Today â All that talk from Republican presidential contenders about eliminating a Wall Street tax break has apparently convinced President Obama that a consensus might be building. During an appearance before the Business Roundtable, the president is expected to press the idea of using revenue from increasing taxes on investment managers to resolve the looming fiscal impasse and to generate tax dollars for higher domestic and military spending. The response should be telling about how much influence Mr. Trump and Mr. Bush, who have also backed eliminating the tax break, have with national business leaders.Â â Carl Hulse â Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has been a frequent target of the Black Lives Matter protest movement, is expected to meet with members of the group in the afternoon. It will be Mr. Sandersâs second appearance this week with a potentially acrimonious crowd: He spoke on Monday at Liberty University, the Christian conservative institution founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. â And Hillary Rodham Clinton, who danced alongside Ellen DeGeneres on her daytime talk show last week, will appear on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, who is known for challenging his guests to throw-down lip-syncing contests. Our Favorites from The Times â Something unmistakable has happened to Mr. Trump since he announced his campaignÂ for president in June: He has become a better candidate. â The Democratic National CommitteeÂ is movingÂ to drastically strengthen its fund-raising arm, adding a co-chairman and six others to leadership positions to help raise money for the 2016 presidential race. â A day before they spar in person, several of the candidates readied new salvos in the ad wars,Â with Mr. Jindal, theÂ conservative groupÂ Club for Growth,Â andÂ Mr. BushÂ swinging hard at Mr. Trump;Â Mr. CruzÂ reachingÂ for the national security mantle; andÂ Mr. PaulÂ presenting himselfÂ as âa real conservative.â â And CNN has said that it will encourageÂ the Republican participants in the debate to directly confront one another over the issues, an approach that differs from the Fox News debate, which relied on the moderators to ask tough questions and yielded only a handful of memorable exchanges between candidates. What We’re Reading Elsewhere â Politico recounts Mr. Perry’s interview with Fox News on Monday night, and his claim that his failure to qualify for the first Republican debate âhad a very negative impact on our fund-raising through the summerâ and was a main factor in his withdrawal from the race. â Â CNN, mirroring the thesis of a recent ad from the National Immigration Forum Action Fund, writes that,âWhile Reagan is recognized among Republicans as the greatest president in modern times, most G.O.P. presidential candidates are ignoring his approach to immigration.â âÂ And The Washington Post pored over several of Mr. Trumpâs speeches and found some hidden Haikus. For example: I was like the fair-
haired boy. Do I look fair-haired?
