PARK CITY, Utah â The 2016 presidential season may have started early â but expect it to go long. At least that was the message from Spencer Zwick, who was the finance chairman for former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, at the 2012 Republican presidential nominee’s annual donor retreat in Park City. Speaking to reporters Thursday night, Mr. Zwick said he did not see the Republican nominee race âas an early knockout.â The reason? âIf youâre at 1 percent in the polls, why would you get out?â he said. âThere is no downside to staying in the race. In the worst case, you might get a TV show after it all.â Look no farther, Mr. Zwick said, than Rick Santorum âa Republican presidential candidate again in 2016 who, despite little campaign infrastructure and money in 2012, forced Mr. Romney into a prolonged primary fight. Mr. Zwick recalled a moment during the 2012 campaign, when he was waiting to catch a JetBlue red-eye back to Boston after a presidential debate in Las Vegas. The Romney team, he said, was âin full swingâ â with a private charter plane and full campaign apparatus. âAnd I was waiting in line at the JetBlue red-eye, and about 30 people behind me was Rick Santorum, waiting to get on a middle seat to fly to Boston to be able to go New Hampshire,â Mr. Zwick recalled, shaking his head in mix of awe and admiration. âIt dawned on me right there, wow, there is no barrier to entry. As long as you can have enough money to buy a commercial airline ticket to get to the next state, youâve got a ticket, you can go. It was like this surreal moment I had on the campaign. Here were we, building this massive infrastructure and this political machine, and you know, Senator Santorum is standing there with his carry-on bag, getting in line.â And, Mr. Zwick added, Mr. Santorum âwasnât even Group 1. I was at least in the even more space section.â âThis guy was on national TV, debating,â he added, and yet âthere was no campaign infrastructure.â So, Mr. Zwick concluded, expect the JetBlue primary â where just about any candidate, especially one with a wealthy donor and a “super PAC,” can stay in the race â to go on, and on, and on.
