Good Friday morning from Washington. It has been only a few hours since 17 Republicans gathered in two debates in an effort to stand apart. As expected, the big names remained big, but a few lesser-known candidates found a way to rise above the crowded field, at least for a night. It was a night of two debates, but in a way, Thursday evening’s marathon in Cleveland felt like three events. The prime-time debate co-hosted by Fox News and Facebook almost seemed to split into parts: the one focused on Donald J. Trump, and the one focused on the remaining nine candidates. The rambunctious, fast-paced debate returned repeatedly to the real estate developer, who was often reminded by the three moderators of his previous statements in support, for example, of a single-payer health care system. For his opening act of the debate, Mr. Trump stood on the Republican debate stage and said he would not rule out running as an independent. He was roundly booed. It remains to be seen whether that, or his criticisms of the moderator Megyn Kelly, will hurt Mr. Trump, who has proved so far to be a Teflon candidate. But the other candidates were holding a mostly different debate — at times substantive, such as when Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, sparred over entitlement overhaul, and at other times personality-driven, such as when Mr. Christie and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky laced into each other over the benefits and downsides of government intrusions in the name of national security. At times, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas sounded overly rehearsed, but he managed to appeal to Mr. Trump’s supporters while differentiating himself as well. Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon, and Mr. Huckabee each had good moments, but they were not standouts. The performance by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was widely considered strong, save for a tangled answer to whether he supported an abortion exception for rape and incest. (Democrats have already signaled that they plan to pounce.) Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin turned questions well, but seemed flat. Jeb Bush improved as the debate wore on, but he was dogged by questions about immigration and about having served on the board of a socially liberal foundation. The biggest breakout performance, however, was from Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, who essentially introduced himself to the rest of the country as a conservative more in the vein of Mr. Bush’s brother than Mr. Bush himself. He acknowledged the anger that Mr. Trump has tapped into with a segment of the electorate while suggesting he simply has a different perspective. But, in many ways, the debate was both deeply engaging and unsurprising, with an uncertain impact on a crowded race. By the time the 10 men — and, as some followers of our live chat pointed out on Thursday night, they were all men — took the stage, the lone woman in the 17-person race, Carly Fiorina, was still getting positive reviews from the first debate, held hours earlier in an almost-empty arena. Ms. Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive and a past target of Mr. Trump’s attacks, has had a hard time breaking through the fog of the contest coverage. But she may have helped herself moving forward. Maggie Haberman Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. Times reporters fact-checked several statements during the debates, including Mr. Bush on economic growth, Mr. Kasich on inequality and Mr. Trump on the Iraq war. Debate watchers in Brooklyn and in Sioux City, Iowa, offered their views on crucial moments from Mr. Rubio, Mr. Paul and others. And in the final count, Mr. Trump spoke more than double the time of some of his colleagues and took advantage of those opportunities. Though debates during general elections are more widely watched, Vox writes, the primary debates are more consequential since: “The policy differences between the candidates are much smaller, and many highly engaged people are genuinely undecided. So primary debate performances can swing outcomes in a way that’s not true for the general election.” The Fox News moderators asked Mr. Trump tough questions, a sign, BuzzFeed says, that the network has turned on him. And in the debate post-mortems, viewers and news outlets declared their verdicts on the winners, the losers and the best moments.There was widespread sentiment that Ms. Fiorina was indeed the winner of the first debate. And, though the verdict was more split on the second, there were several exchanges that seemed to register with viewers. The Labor Department will release employment data for July. June’s numbers decreased from May, but were considered “weaker than they appeared.” The American Psychological Association will vote in the morning on whether to prohibit psychologists from involvement in national security interrogations. After only a few hours sleep after the debate, five of the Republican candidates will join together again, this time in Atlanta for the RedState Gathering, “a two-day grass-roots event.” On Friday, Mr. Christie, Rick Perry, Ms. Fiorina, Mr. Rubio and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana will appear. On Saturday, so will Mr. Bush, Mr. Walker, Mr. Huckabee, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada is making moves in his communications shop as he prepares to leave the Senate at the end of next year, promoting two fiercely loyal aides who are adept at aggressively spreading the Democratic message. He is promoting Adam Jentleson from communications director to deputy chief of staff with a focus on strategic planning. And Kristen Orthman, the current communications deputy who has worked for Mr. Reid since 2008 in both Washington and Nevada, will take over the communications director’s job and become chief spokeswoman. Mr. Jentleson, who has been in Mr. Reid’s office since 2010, is also known for keeping close track of Mitch McConnell‘s stewardship of the Senate and comparing it with his earlier pledges on how he would run the place as Senate majority leader. — Carl Hulse On the anniversary of the signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, President Obama argued that court decisions and state statutes discouraging âcertain kinds of folksâ from voting were threatening to erode the fundamental promise of the law. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the most influential Jewish voice in Congress, said on Thursday night that he would oppose Mr. Obamaâs deal to limit Iranâs nuclear program. And after 16 years of presiding over âThe Daily Show,â the Comedy Central news-parody show, Jon Stewart said goodbye on Thursday evening. Twitter has stolen much of the thunder and excitement from the traditional âspin room,â the room next to the debate stage where candidates and press officers try to frame their performance for reporters. But all it took to reignite the fire in Cleveland on Thursday night was a little taste of the Donald. Mr. Trump made a brief appearance in the spin room after the debate, and chaos erupted. More than 50 reporters swarmed him, forming a halo of lights, lenses and sharp elbows as the candidate spoke for roughly three to four minutes. What did he say? It was inaudible to more than two-thirds of the scrum, as snippets of him criticizing Ms. Kellyâs questioning and describing his call with Bill Clinton could barely be heard above the crush. And when he had enough, the commotion descended into a dash of danger. The horde moved tightly. A few reporters fell at Mr. Trump’s feet and were at risk of being trampled. The ensemble carefully straddled a long, thin floor light. A few errant shuffles kicked the light out, and a few more dislodged it. No one was hurt, and a reporter who fell was promptly helped up. A few walked away laughing: âThat was intenseâ seemed to be the common thought. — Nick Corasaniti The newsletter on Thursday misstated the state that Ron Paul represented as a member of Congress. It was Texas, not Tennessee. Like the Politics Newsletter? Get it delivered to your inbox.
