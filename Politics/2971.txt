Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida published videos in English and Spanish this morning announcing Right to Rise, his new political action committee, and it looks as though he did it on the doorstep of some potential donors. According to a First Draft analysis of the video, Mr. Bush was standing on East 51st Street in New York, right in front of the offices of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and a frequent contributor to political campaigns.  Of course, Mr. Bush will need a lot of big donors like BlackRock â and financial firms are hard to miss in Manhattan â but the announcement comes as his own ties to the big-money private equity business are already being scrutinized. Although Mr. Bush is still a partner at the private equity firm Britton Hill, which he created, he stepped down from several boards of corporations and financial firms at the end of last year, adding to speculation that he would run for president in 2016. Recently released emails from his time as Florida’s governor show that Mr. Bush attended an informal meeting at BlackRock’s office in 2005, which an aide said was intended to “create good will with our major investors and provide the governor with an opportunity to showcase his accomplishments in leading the state.” While there are surely potential donors for Mr. Bush at BlackRock, getting the support of its chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, could be a challenge. Mr. Fink backed President Obama in the two previous elections. A spokeswoman for Mr. Bush did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
