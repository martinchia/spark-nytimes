Mitt Romney criticized the real-estate mogul and presidential candidate Donald Trump on Saturday, saying he was damaging the Republican Party with his comments linking Mexican immigrants to crime. Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, spoke at a Fourth of July parade in Wolfeboro, N.H., where he owns a home. He was asked whether Mr. Trump’s comments depicting Mexican immigrants as violent predators had hurt a party that has been trying to make inroads with Hispanics. “Yes,” he replied, in remarks reported by CNN. “I think he made a severe error in saying what he did about Mexican-Americans.” Some of Mr. Trump’s Republican rivals, like Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, former governors Jeb Bush of Florida and George E. Pataki of New York, have also taken issue with his comments. And the Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton has been alluding to the comments in trying to portray the Republican field as a whole as anti-immigrant.
