Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican presidential candidate from South Carolina, called on Monday for the Confederate battle flag to be removed from the state’s Capitol.  “I am urging that the Confederate battle flag be removed from State House grounds to an appropriate location,” he said in a statement. “I hope that, by removing the flag, we can take another step towards healing and recognition â and a sign that South Carolina is moving forward.â Gov. Nikki Haley also called for the flag’s removal at a news conference at the Capitol in Columbia. The state’s other senator, Tim Scott, also a Republican, was expected to do the same, The Post and Courier of Charleston reported on Monday.  The decision by the state’s political leadership comes after a difficult few days for South Carolina after nine churchgoers were killed in Charleston last week.  The flag, which is seen as a symbol of Civil War-era racism by many Americans, has become a litmus test for presidential contenders. Mr. Graham initially said that he would be fine with it being taken down but acknowledged that the flag was “part of who we are.” As The New York Times reported earlier on Monday, there was a push in the late 1990s to take it down, but the flag continued to fly above South Carolinaâs copper-domed Capitol until 2000, when a bipartisan agreement was reached to move it to a Confederate memorial nearby. âThat compromise was widely accepted,â Mr. Graham recalled. âBut in light of what has happened, that has to be revisited because the shooter is so associated with the flag.â While Democrats have been largely united in calling for the flag to be taken down, Republican presidential candidates have been careful to call it a state matter.  CNN reported Mr. Graham’s decision earlier on Monday.  By FRANCES ROBLES, RICHARD FAUSSET and MICHAEL BARBARO Gov. Nikki Haleyâs call to remove the flag from Capitol grounds came in the wake of the killing of nine people in a Charleston church.
