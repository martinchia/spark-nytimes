When in Las Vegas â¦ what better way to break a tie in a political caucus than a deck of cards? On Friday, the Nevada Democratic Party released answers to frequently asked questions ahead of the caucuses on Saturday. The guidelines included the 250 caucus locations statewide (including the Wynn, Caesars Palace and other casinos on the Las Vegas strip and remote outposts near Indian reservations), who can participate (anyone! Independents and Republicans can even show up the day of the caucuses and register as Democrats to participate) and what time the caucuses will start (check in opens at 11 a.m., an early morning start by Las Vegas standards). But the guidance also included what would happen if Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders happen to tie on Saturday. Enter the deck of cards. âIn the rare circumstances where two or more presidential preference groups are tied for the loss or gain of a precinct-level delegate and have the same lowest or highest decimal,â the state party says, âgroups must draw a single card from a deck of cards to break the tie. High card determines the winner.â The stakes are high on Saturday.
