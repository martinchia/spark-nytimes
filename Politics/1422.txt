President Obama has been in East Africa since late last week, making stops in Ethiopia and Kenya, the homeland of his father. Mr. Obama’s fourth trip to sub-Saharan Africa as president, however, will not include a stop in his fatherâs village, Kogelo, where Mr. Obama was welcomed as a native son on his last visit there, in 2006, as a United States senator from Illinois. A half a century ago, against a much different backdrop, President John F. Kennedy made a similar homecoming to his familyâs native Ireland. Mr. Kennedy, the first Irish Catholic to occupy the White House, touched down in Dublin in late June 1963 and spent the next few days making speeches across the country, including to the Irish Parliament. On June 27, he set politics aside for a visit to his familyâs homestead in Dunganstown, County Wexford. There, gathered with Irish relatives around the fireplace in the home of his cousin Mary Ryan, Mr. Kennedy reportedly shared a cup of tea, some cake and a toast to âall those Kennedys who went and all those Kennedys who stayed.â
