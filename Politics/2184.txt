Former Gov. Mike Huckabee hinted that he might ramp up his happy warrior act as his presidential campaign moves forward. The Republican from Arkansas closed out Thursday night’s debate with a dash of humor, pretending that he was about to criticize Donald J. Trump before hitting Hillary Rodham Clinton as being someone who had high poll numbers but no clue about governing. On Friday, he said that he was trying to stand out from the crowd with a little levity. “There was so much heaviness about the debate, but I always believe that sometimes we need to bring a little levity to it,” Mr. Huckabee said on Fox News. “Those of us who run, we need not take ourselves so seriously.” Mr. Huckabee signaled that he would maintain his seriousness on the issues he is passionate about. Asked about how his rivals responded to questions about gay marriage, he pointed out that his conservative views on the issue were in light with what President Obama and Mrs. Clinton were saying in 2008. “Barack Obama said he believed it because it was a Biblical issue and God was in the mix,” Mr. Huckabee said of traditional marriage, while arguing that the president’s change of heart on the issue was political.
