Oil and water, meet de Blasio and Trump. In a clash of political foils on Wednesday, New York Cityâs avowedly liberal mayor, Bill de Blasio, took direct aim at Donald J. Trump, New York Cityâs most avowedly iconoclastic Republican, accusing the developer of âliterally trying to undermine fundamental constitutional rights.â The mayor was referring to Mr. Trumpâs stance on immigration, but he widened his criticism to take in the developerâs disparaging comments about women, Mexican-Americans, and the worthiness of Senator John McCainâs war service. âAll of these outrageous and inappropriate statements, they will be noted by the American voters,â Mr. de Blasio said in a radio interview on WNYC. âI just donât think in the end that flies for someone who could actually be president of the United States.â âI donât think anyone should take Donald Trump lightly,â Mr. de Blasio added, in a warning to fellow liberals. âWhen you take conservatives lightly, you end up getting burned a lot of the time.â So does Mr. de Blasio have a preferred candidate? Prodded to endorse Hillary Rodham Clinton, his former boss, the mayor declined â again â although he conceded that Mrs. Clinton “has presented an increasingly compelling vision.”  This was not Mr. de Blasioâs first attack on Mr. Trump: In July, he vowed to review city contracts with Trump-affiliated companies, although City Hall officials later conceded they may not have legal standing to sever ties.  âWeâre certainly not looking to do any business with him going forward,â the mayor said. Still, the two men have at least one habit in common: They both like to eat pizza with a fork.
