Bernie Sanders came to Coney Island Sunday afternoon and did what 99 percent of people might have expected: He ate a hotdog at Nathan’s. Surrounded by a crush of cameras and cheering supporters Mr. Sanders, the senator from Vermont, came to the famous establishment with his wife, Jane, and Michael Stipe, the former frontman for the band R.E.M., after holding a rally on the nearby boardwalk.  “This is a breaking story,” Mr. Sanders said smiling, when asked how he liked his hot dog. “Mustard and sauerkraut.”  His wife frowned. “Ketchup, sometimes onions,” Ms. Sanders said. Mr. Sanders stopped to take photos with people as he walked into Nathan’s. “I love you Bernie,” a woman screamed to him. “I trust you.” As he ate, dozens of reporters and supporters snapped photos and videos. Later, Mr. Sanders and his wife quickly got into a waiting car and drove off.
