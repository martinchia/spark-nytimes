Updated, 2:13 p.m. | AMHERST, N.H. â Is Scott Walker too conservative to win the New Hampshire primary? Mr. Walker, the Wisconsin governor who has been increasingly running to the right to help himself in the Iowa caucuses, faced that question from a reporter as he arrived at his first campaign event in New Hampshire on Thursday. Well aware that independent voters can cast ballots in the Republican primary in this state, and could be a decisive force, Mr. Walker put some distance between himself and the conservative label. âThis state is an independent state, Iâm an independent guy,â Mr. Walker said outside Joeyâs Diner in Amherst.  Asked if issues like abortion, same-sex marriage, and the ban on gay Boy Scout leaders were issues that would hurt Republicans in the 2016 general election, Mr. Walker said, âThose arenât what Iâm running on.â He added, âIâm a social conservative as well, but my primary reputation comes from my work on economic and fiscal issues. As president, thatâs where Iâd be focused in on.â Referring to his fights in Wisconsin against labor unions, among others, he added: âI took the power out of the hands of the big government special interest and put it firmly in the hands of the American people. I donât think the people of New Hampshire want to be told who they should vote for â they want to hear who the right person is to lead this country forward.â Asked if he considered himself an independent or a conservative, Mr. Walker paused for a couple of seconds, then said, âIâm an American, thatâs what I am. Iâm an American. Iâm going to continue to stand for American values.â Mr. Walker has been focused more on wooing the conservative and evangelical Republican electorate in Iowa, which he considers a must win for his candidacy, than voters in New Hampshire, where he hasnât campaigned since May. Several of his Republican rivals, including former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, and Donald J. Trump, have been spending more time in New Hampshire lately. Mr. Walker also sharply criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton as he talked up what he sees as his strengths if they face each other as the presidential nominees of their parties. âWhat makes us a great candidate against Hillary Clinton is three simple things: Iâm a new fresh face — sheâs a candidate of the past. Iâm about as anti-Washington as you can get — she embodies everything thatâs wrong with Washington. And Iâve actually gotten something done, Iâve gotten real things done in a tough state,â Mr. Walker said. âI think youâd be hard-pressed to even find supporters of her than accumulate a lot of frequent flyer miles traveling around the world,â he continued. âAs secretary of state, I think it would be hard to argue that the places sheâs been involved with over the first four years of Obamaâs tenure arenât more messed up today than they were before she and the president took office.”
