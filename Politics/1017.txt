Good Wednesday morning. It has been a week of details and bargaining as Congress approaches the so-called fiscal cliff confident that it will avoid the sudden drop on the other side, and as campaigns have offered policy proposals among the usual politics. But a policy hint by Hillary Rodham Clinton, in an effort to reach out to unions, has still not slowed the groupsâ flirtations with other candidates. The last five years have been difficult for organized labor. The rise of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who made their political bones as union-busting leaders, coincided with an economic recovery in which many states saw their pension mandates and their debt grow. And yet, despite waning influence on the left in recent years and a shift in the partyâs demographic base, organized labor is playing a pivotal role in the Democratic nominating contest so far. Support in a number of unions for the populist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont have kept many of them from making the early endorsements that Mrs. Clintonâs campaign has sought. Concern about her position on the trans-Pacific trade deal that President Obama has pushed for has also kept some back. So Mrs. Clintonâs support on Tuesday for repealing the so-called Cadillac tax on certain health care plans under the Affordable Care Act, a move urged by many unions, was welcomed by labor, after others in the Democratic field had taken that position. Yet many labor groups still plan to try to send her a message. The Teamsters, for instance, is said to be seeking a meeting with Donald J. Trump, whose comments on illegal immigrants and about Mr. Obamaâs birthplace are well noted. That a major union, in such a racially charged election, would seek to meet with Mr. Trump is striking. — Maggie Haberman What We’re Watching âÂ  Two days after releasing one of his few detailed policy plans, a tax proposal that would lower taxes for the middle class and the richest Americans and that would eliminate them for many lower-income residents, Mr. Trump will hold a rally at a high school in Keene, N.H. âÂ Â Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Fusion, a network started by ABC and Univision, will host a forum seeking changes in the juvenile justice system, a portion of the larger criminal justice debate that has covered rare common ground in both parties, especially over incarceration rates. â Â Jeb Bush will hold a round-table discussion at a Catholic Medical Center in New Hampshire on substance abuse. Congress Is Poised for a Reprieve in a Continuing Battle With just hours to spare, Congress is poised to resolve its government shutdown drama on Wednesday â at least for now. The Senate is scheduled to vote at 10 a.m. on a stopgap spending measure that funds the government through Dec. 11. It will then rush the legislation over to the House for an expected vote there sometime before midnight, when the governmentâs fiscal year comes to a close. Because the legislation does not restrict spending on Planned Parenthood, conservative House Republicans are expected to balk at the deal, which will need a large number of Democrats to support it to ensure passage. Speaker John A. Boehnerâs decision to step down has cleared the way for such a result. But the solution â like the legislation â is only temporary. The Republican leadership had hoped the respite would allow time to negotiate a new budget plan with the White House and congressional Democrats. Mr. Boehnerâs decision has added new urgency to the effort, with top Republicans and Democrats suddenly pressing for a comprehensive agreement before Mr. Boehnerâs exit on Oct. 31 and before House Republicans are under new management. âI hope we can get this stuff done before the speaker moves on to whatever heâs going to do,â said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader. âÂ Carl Hulse Candidates Defend Iowa and New Hampshire Amid Talk of Shake-Up As presidential candidates park themselves in Iowa and New Hampshire before the first two nominating contests next year, the Republican Party is mulling new ways of nationalizing the process so that power in the election season is wielded by a larger portion of voters. Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, told the National Journal that changing the order had been a âhot topicâ in the party and suggested that he was open to the idea. âI donât think there should ever be any sacÂ­red cows as to the primary process or the order,âÂ he said. Lawmakers in New Hampshire, which clings tightly to its âfirst in the nationâ status, were not pleased with the idea, and William M. Gardner, the secretary of state, reiterated that a state law requires it to maintain its leadoff role. At the same time, Republican presidential candidates who have been vying for the affection of New Hampshire voters were not exactly willing to go out on a limb and call for a shake-up. Mr. Bush posted on Twitter that New Hampshire should remain first in the nation. Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio issued a statement arguing Iowa and New Hampshire had âearnedâ the responsibility of vetting candidates up close. Hoping to surprise with a strong showing in New Hampshire, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said that the system worked just fine as it was and that changing it would be âirresponsible and a bad idea.â And a spokesman for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said that the campaign always thought that New Hampshire and Iowa should be first: âMarco is very happy with the calendar the way it is.â While the candidates have been busy bickering lately, they seem to agree that offending voters in Iowa and New Hampshire is a losing strategy. â Alan Rappeport Our Favorites From The Times âÂ House conservativesÂ are pushingÂ RepresentativeÂ Trey Gowdy of South Carolina,Â one ofÂ Mrs. ClintonâsÂ biggest antagonists, as an alternative toÂ Kevin McCarthy of California as the new majority leader afterÂ Mr. BoehnerÂ leaves. âÂ Speaking in Pennsylvania,Â Mr. BushÂ called for ending crude oil bansÂ and assailed Mr. ObamaÂ andÂ Mrs. ClintonÂ for opposing the Keystone XL oil pipeline. âÂ In testimony before a House committee,Â Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood, deplored what she called âoutrageous accusationsâ that her organization profits from the sale of fetal tissue, an issue that has been a central feature of many Republican campaigns, especially those ofÂ Carly FiorinaÂ andÂ Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Donald Trumpâs Life in a Bubble Mark Leibovich of the Times magazine profiled Mr. Trump as âhe keeps dominating the campaign and the conversation,â even as his opponents âwould love to dismiss him as a sideshow.â Here is a quick aside: Every time the camera panned to Trump during debates or he begins to say something, everyone in the press filing centers (where Iâve watched both) looked up expectedly, and chuckled. It was as if itâs still unbelievable that this entrenched American persona has actually crossed-over and unleashed himself on the political mummies lining the rest of the stage. It can be hard to look away. As I often do, I find myself thinking of a line from Austin Powers. Our favorite International Man of Mystery was longing for the âconsequence-free environmentâ that he inhabited in the 1960s (before he was frozen and awakened in the 1990s). In a sense, Mr. Trump is operating in a âconsequence-free environmentâ of his own creation inside the Republican Party. The usual rules of deference, providing policy plans and, yes, political correctness, do not apply to him. He never apologizes, nor should he have to, given his audience. He has created his own rules and made himself gaffe-proof. âÂ Mark Leibovich Bulletins: Fund-Raisers, Endorsements and a Slip of the Tongue â A former top fund-raiser forÂ Mr. Walker,Â Anthony Scaramucci, who had been pursued by many other campaigns,Â has joinedÂ withÂ Mr. BushâsÂ team. â Despite some bleak polling in Iowa, Mr.Â Christie accepted the endorsementsÂ on Tuesday of a group of top state businessmen, led by the agribusiness mogul and political kingmaker Bruce Rastetter. âÂ And at a United Nations summit meeting, the Danish foreign ministerÂ briefly and inadvertently promotedÂ Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. What Weâre Reading Elsewhere â Â Boston Magazine takes a look at the campaign of Mr. SandersÂ and asks: âHeâs chilly with staff, frosty with fans, and regularly ices out reporters. So how is the socialist firebrand from Vermont suddenly torching Hillary Clinton in the race for president?â âÂ In an interview with Forbes, the billionaire conservative Charles G. Koch, who along with his brother holds outsize influence in donor circles, spoke about the âout of control, irresponsible spending by both parties that are taking us toward bankruptcyâ and âmisguided policies creating a permanent underclass.â But when asked if he would support Mr. Trump if he won the nomination, Mr. Koch said, âWeâre not going to talk about that.â â Â The Huffington Post writes that Mrs. Fiorina, who has risen in the polls but has faced criticism for her tenure as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and has been accused of inaccurately describing the Planned Parenthood videos, defended her time at the company and said: âPolitics is a fact-free zone. People just say things.â âÂ And Politico says that the âsuper PACâ supporting Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has stopped raising money.
