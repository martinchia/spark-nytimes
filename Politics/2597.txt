DES MOINES â The fast-growing social media platform Snapchat just landed its first political ad.  The American Action Network, an outside group closely associated with the House Republican leadership, placed a 10-second ad on Snapchat pegged to Senator Joni Ernst’s inaugural “Roast and Ride” here on Saturday. The buy is part of a larger, $900,000 campaign by the network urging Congress to pass trade promotion authority.  The ad will appear as part of a Snapchat-curated “live story” â which will include a variety of photos and videos from Ms. Ernst’s event â and will be promoted to users in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Washington, D.C. “Weâre excited to be the first in the political space to utilize the growing medium for advertising,” said Dan Conston, communications director for the American Action Network. “A.A.N. is using Snapchat because its allowing us to deliver an engaging ad experience to an audience of influencers and younger, hard to reach voters.” Indeed, Snapchat users not only trend younger but,  to view any content on the app, including ads, users must hold a finger on the screen â meaning, says Snapchat, they are the highly engaged audience that advertisers covet. “Users watching the Roast and Ride story today are likely interested in politics but may be surprised to see our direct appeal to pass T.P.A. in the story,” Mr. Conston said. “We think that will resonate and be memorable with this key audience.”
