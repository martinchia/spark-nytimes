Good Wednesday morning from Washington, where House Republicans face a crucial decision on trade and President Obama is making a fiery defense of his health care law ahead of a Supreme Court ruling. But another court’s ruling could breathe new life into Gov. Chris Christie‘s presidential hopes. New Jerseyâs highest court handed Mr. Christie a victory on Tuesday when it allowed him to skip the pension payments he promised to make in a signature law. That means he wonât have to find the $1.58 billion a lower court had wanted him to restore to this yearâs state budget, and it will make balancing next yearâs budget a lot easier. He can decide whether to run for president, a call he has promised to make this month, spared of any âfiscal crisisâ headlines. The court sided with him against public employee unions, which may help remind Republican primary voters that the governor was willing to take on those powerful interests â a fight that spurred his rise to national stardom. But the decision could also reinforce doubts among Republicans about his fiscal management of New Jersey. Mr. Christie couldnât make the payments because the stateâs job growth has lagged well behind neighboring states and the nation. The missed payments resulted in a record nine credit downgrades. While Mr. Christie has been selling himself as a straight shooter, the court, despite its ruling for him, didnât make him seem like a man of his word. âThe loss of public trust due to the broken promisesâ in the law, the court wrote in its decision, âis staggering.â Mr. Christie speaks at a Latino Coalition event on Wednesday in Washington. He won a majority of Latino voters in his re-election two years ago and presents that victory as the kind that can help a Republican win the White House. But that was so many problems ago. Kate Zernike Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will be back at the White House for the first time since his son Beau died. He will meet with the president and later Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk of Ukraine. In the evening, Mr. Biden will return to his family in Delaware. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, will participate in a conference call with the liberal groups MoveOn.org and Democracy for America that will focus on efforts to stop Mr. Obama’s fast-track trade bill. And Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon and Republican candidate, will have a full day in Iowa, including at a foot bank, a conservative club and an ice cream social. A recent poll in the state shows him tied for second place with Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. It looks like decision day for trade in the House of Representatives. Republican leaders, who are still driving for a vote this week on granting expedited negotiating authority to Mr. Obama, need to make the call to proceed if they intend to vote before the weekend. They are likely to reveal their plans after polling Republican colleagues in the morning. Backers of the trade bill say they continue to gain supporters, and House Republicans are increasingly confident they can pass the measure â one of the few instances where they are allied with Mr. Obama against the vast majority of House Democrats. Should the leadership decide to go ahead, aides say, the first opportunity to vote will most likely be on Friday, given the time requirements in bringing legislation to the floor. Backers of the measure may then have to keep the pressure on colleagues to stay in town given how tight the margin is expected to be. Should they hold off this week, the trade vote is almost certain for next week. — Carl Hulse If the Supreme Court guts a crucial part of the Affordable Health Care Act this month, Mr. Obama wants everyone to know whom to blame. Twice in the last two days, the president has used tough language to describe those seeking a court ruling that would invalidate the law’s health care subsidies for millions of people. In remarks on Monday, he said such a ruling would be a “contorted reading” of the law. And in a speech on Tuesday, he condemned critics of the law as “cynical” partisans. It is no accident that the president’s words are getting fiery. If the court undermines the health care law, the political chaos will be as intense as the financial crisis facing insurance companies and people with low incomes, whose premiums will rise drastically. Mr. Obama is hoping to reinforce the idea that the health care law is now “part of the fabric of how we care for one another,” as he said on Tuesday. The message: If Republicans refuse to fix the law in the wake of a court ruling, the White House is betting that they will be deemed responsible for destroying an established part of the social safety net. But Republicans on Capitol Hill are already jockeying to blame the president by saying that any impact of a court ruling would simply be the result of a bad law. The court’s decision is expected before the end of June. — Michael D. Shear Senator Marco Rubio of Florida stands out among the presidential contenders for his youth, his fast political rise and recurring doubts about how he manages his finances. And Jeb Bush was in Germany on the first leg of his European trip, where he delivered a forceful rebuke of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and then continued on that theme today. And while in Germany today, Mr. Bush also explained the shake-up of his campaign team, citing the âmagnitude of the journeyâ he faces as a candidate. Robert Gibbs, a former spokesman for Mr. Obama, is moving on to McDonaldâs to be its âchief communications officer,â making some wonder if he lost his taste for the White Houseâs healthy eating initiatives. But Mr. Gibbs might find himself at odds with another aspect of the Obama administrationâs agenda â raising the minimum wage. Mr. Obama has proposed raising the pay floor to $10.10 an hour. Despite announcing plans to lift wages, McDonaldâs has faced protests from its workers who say they are underpaid, while liberal groups have been pushing for the minimum wage to be raised to $15 an hour. Mr. Gibbs can expect to face off with them again as the top spokesman for the worldâs largest restaurant chain. The backlash has already started. Ty Moore, a national organizer for 15 Now, an advocacy group for a $15 minimum wage, called the chain’s hiring of Mr. Gibbs unfortunate and said the Obama administration hadnât done enough to support low-wage workers. âItâs not surprising,â Mr. Moore said. âThereâs a revolving door between senior executive officials and industries.â — Alan Rappeport Politico quotes Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who is not married, as saying he would have a “rotating first lady,” if he was successful in his bid for the White House. And the “super PAC” supporting Mr. Bush, The Washington Post writes, will most likely fail to meet the $100 million estimate it had expected to raise by the end of the month. The year 2016 isn’t here yet, but Politico explains what everyone has already gotten wrong about it. Myth No. 1 is that the Republican field is predictable. After nearly two decades reporting in Washington, Iâm no stranger to being interrupted while asking a question. But Tuesday was a first. A little more than half an hour into the televised daily White House briefing, I was questioning Josh Earnest, the press secretary, about the large breach of federal employeesâ personal information when two armed Secret Services agents appeared at the door and abruptly evacuated the briefing room. It was a bomb scare, we would learn. âWe need to interrupt,â one of the agents said as I was midsentence. âWe need to evacuate the press briefing room.â Mr. Earnest quickly wrapped up, closed his binder and left the podium. âWeâll come back,â he said. The Metropolitan Police Department had received a telephoned bomb threat specifically mentioning the briefing room. The Secret Service did not evacuate the president from the Oval Office, which is just down the corridor, nor were Michelle Obama or their daughters Sasha and Malia moved from the East Wing residence nearby. West Wing staff members stayed put, too. Most of us stood in a tunnel entrance just outside, keeping the White House in sight; the whole thing was over in about 30 minutes. We received the âall clearâ and trudged back in to pick up the briefing where we left off. Adding to the mystery, news cameras inside the briefing room and just outside the West Wing were either covered or pointed to the ground, preventing them from capturing what occurred while we were barred from the room. There was plenty of speculation about other reasons we’d been removed. Noting that the evacuation began while I was asking about the hack of Office of Personnel Management computer systems, I asked Mr. Earnest on Twitter: âWas it something I said?â — Julie Hirschfeld Davis Like the Politics Newsletter?
