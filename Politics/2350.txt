The police in Burlington, Vt., warned that Donald J. Trumpâs campaign has confirmed that 6,500 people plan to attend a rally on Thursday in an arena that seats only about 1,400.   For Mr. Trump to schedule a visit to the hometown of Senator Bernie Sanders, whom he regularly tweaks as a âsocialist-communistâ or even a âmaniac,” is certainly a provocation. For the Trump campaign to plan on a large overflow, leaving many people in the street, where the police expect counterprotests, seems to be kicking it up a notch.  âThe Burlington Police Department, and the city generally, welcomes everyone who wishes to take part in the democratic process,” the police said in a statement released on Wednesday, adding that âthere will likely be protests, demonstrations and rallies from different political perspectives in the cityâs public spaces.” The Trump rally is scheduled for the Flynn Center for the Performing Arts at 7 p.m.  Noting that event planners often distribute more tickets than seats for political rallies, anticipating no-shows, the police said that the Trump campaign reported issuing 20,000 free tickets, of which âat least 6,500â people have confirmed. The department warned of potential traffic congestion and urged people to arrive by âpublic transportation, foot or bicycle.” Mr. Sandersâs political ascent began with his election in 1981 as the mayor of Burlington, which became known as the âPeopleâs Republic of Burlingtonâ for its leftist culture. It would seem hostile ground for Mr. Trump, although he has a lead over other Republicans in Vermont polls.  At the rallies of both candidates, many attendees express overlapping concerns on issues â opposing trade deals that eliminate manufacturing jobs, cuts to Social Security, wealth inequality and the hollowing out of the middle class. Mr. Sanders welcomed Mr. Trump to Burlington in a statement.  âI hope his presence here will help him better understand Vermont values â social and economic justice, tolerance, respect for all people and the environment,â he said.
