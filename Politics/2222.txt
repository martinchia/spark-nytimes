Bobby Jindal, the Louisiana governor who is running for president, raised about $579,000 in the week since he entered the race, he reported in campaign-finance filings on Wednesday. The amount is smaller than many other Republican candidates in the primary field. But it comprises only a week from June 24 through June 30, the last seven days of the filing quarter. Mr. Jindal was one of the last entrants to the race. Struggling to overcome low polling, Mr. Jindal nonetheless is being bolstered by outside groups, including a “super PAC” and a nonprofit organization, which are reported to have raised about $8 million in the last six months. Brad Todd, an adviser to the three outside groups backing Mr. Jindal, confirmed they had raised more than $8.6 million between them. It was unclear how much they have spent so far.
