Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016âs first proper bus tour. EVENT 26 Time: 2:27 p.m., Jan. 9 Place: Oelwein, Iowa (population: 6,415) Site: Luigiâs Restaurant, with a model cannon, a disco ball and a giant painting of a possibly Italian coastline Mood: Amore, with Cruz lawn signs Food: Uncle Dominicâs Italian beef dinner, Luigiâs Tour of Italy, Steak Vesuvius Tough love: Mr. Cruz, whose older daughter, Caroline, is the frequent subject of gentle stump speech teasing, had begun an anecdote about the 7-year-old when a baby began crying. âShe makes us do that a lot,â Mr. Cruz said. Highlight: âWould it kill Republicans to crack a joke?â Mr. Cruz asked, describing how the party could better appeal to young voters. âActually, I think some of them, it might.â Mr. Cruz has had no such qualms this trip. He recalled for the crowd a series of posters, unaffiliated with his campaign, that had appeared in Los Angeles. They depicted the candidate shirtless (with eight-pack abs), heavily tattooed and smoking a cigarette. âI noticed a glaring error,â Mr. Cruz said, echoing his campaignâs response at the time. âI donât smoke cigarettes.â Saw this, but noticed an error. So I wanted to make one thing clear: I don't smoke cigarettes //t.co/3nn2740kkP pic.twitter.com/tPFNqg9vu8 — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) March 15, 2014  Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
