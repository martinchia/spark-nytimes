Good Tuesday morning. It is indeed the thick of the August lull, but with candidates fighting either to build on momentum from the debates or to make up for any lost ground, there is still work to do. Of course, it remains hard to be heard when one voice continues to rise above the rest, especially when that voice enters its most packed stretch of the campaign so far. Donald J. Trump begins his busiest day since making comments about Megyn Kelly of Fox News that rocked the presidential campaign and drew widespread condemnation from fellow Republicans. It will begin and end, oddly enough, on Fox News. He is scheduled to speak first to the “Fox and Friends” morning program. Then he will appear on “Hannity” in the evening. In between, Mr. Trump will be in Birch Run, Mich., for a local Republican Party dinner. He is the keynote speaker. The event was scheduled well before the debate last week and Mr. Trump’s statement that Ms. Kelly was so worked up during the questioning that she had “blood coming out of her wherever,” a remark many took as an insinuation that she was menstruating. Mr. Trump has denied that. But his presence before a county Republican Party event illustrates what a delicate situation the Republican National Committee finds itself in. The party leadership is deeply uneasy about Mr. Trump’s presence in the race, worrying that his tendency to inflame racial and cultural tensions will set back the party’s efforts to repair its image with minorities. Yet Mr. Trump has caught fire with many Republicans, and any efforts to nudge him from the race are likely to be seen as a plot by the party establishment to silence him and his followers. â Jeremy W. Peters Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. Jeb Bush will give a foreign policy speech, billed as a lecture, at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Library in Southern California. And in the week after the first Republican debate, as many of the candidates are sticking to the early primary states, New Hampshire will be full. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is lagging in the polls and has picked up the mantle of derailing Mr. Trump — “somebody has to challenge him” — will make several appearances in the state, and Hillary Rodham Clinton and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio will also hold events there. Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana are in Iowa. The crowd of hundreds grew restless and the sweet sauce on the meatballs grew cold, as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was nearly 90 minutes late for his second bus-tour event of the day, a rally in Murfreesboro, Tenn. But Mr. Cruz, on a weeklong bus tour through the Southeast, didnât oversleep, nor did his bus take a wrong turn; he instead made a last-second decision to visit a memorial to the soldiers killed in Chattanooga. His first event of the day, a biscuits and gravy breakfast at Graceworks Church in Chattanooga, was only a few miles from the memorial. The campaign had hoped to stop by if time allowed, but the event at the church ran long. So Mr. Cruz decided to deal with the delays and visit the memorial anyway. He and his family stood outside the site, offered a prayer and laid down an American flag. He went inside the recruitment center to share his condolences. âI want to apologize that we were delayed in Chattanooga,â Mr. Cruz told the crowd in Murfreesboro after he arrived. âWe were at the memorial for the four Marines who were killed in an act of radical Islamic terrorism.â The crowd didnât seem to mind; it responded with a standing ovation. â Nick Corasaniti  Jefferson-Jackson dinners, a staple of Democratic politics and regular stop on the presidential candidate circuit, are being renamed across the country because of the slave-owning pasts of Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard professor and democratic theorist, said he would explore a protest bid for the Democratic nomination if he could raise $1 million in small donations by Labor Day, and that he would tie his campaign to the issue of empowering small donors in politics. And, âThis is a tough business,â Ms. Kelly told viewers on Monday, brushing off Mr. Trump‘s comments, saying, âIâll continue doing my job without fear or favor.â In a statement filed under oath in federal court on Monday, Mrs. Clinton said that she had given the State Department all of the work-related emails that were on the personal account she used while she was secretary of state. The sustained ability of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to draw large crowds, Brent Budowsky writes in The New York Observer, is beginning to translate into donations as well. “No other candidate can come even close to the size of his crowds or the clarity, passion and idealism of his message,” Mr. Budowsky argues. “Remember where you heard it first: When the next quarterly campaign finance reports are released in October the political world will be shocked by the breathtaking increase in small donor money to the Sanders campaign.” The tax plans offered by Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders “are more radical” than those pushed by President Obama during his White House runs, Vox writes. “Their real aim is far more ambitious: They want to change the way the economy actually works.” And Reddit sought out Trump supporters for a question â serious answers only â asking them, “So why do you want Trump?” The answers â though often vulgar, so be warned â offer insight into the voters behind the poll numbers that have held strong even amid the accusations of sexism.”That tiny sliver of honesty,” one supporter wrote, “puts him ahead of most politicians in the eyes of the average American.” In another sign of trouble for Mr. Paul, Politico reports, he faces increasing opposition in his efforts to get Kentucky Republicans to change rules to let him run both for president and for re-election to the Senate next year.
