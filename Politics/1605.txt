In a speech in Lower Manhattan during the 2008 Democratic primaries, Hillary Rodham Clinton assailed Wall Street for its role in a subprime mortgage crisis that was months away from becoming the worst financial meltdown since the Great Depression. On Monday, Mrs. Clinton will again choose the area for a major economic address. But this time, speaking at the New School, she will only briefly touch on Wall Street, regulation and the financial industry. Mrs. Clinton is expected to focus on the economic problem she believes is most urgent today: wages for low- and middle-class wage earners that have remained virtually stagnant for 15 years even as the overall economy has grown. Economists call it “the great wage slowdown” of the 21st century, and Mrs. Clinton, who expressed foresight in her proposals for regulating derivatives and subprime mortgages months before the financial crisis hit, believes the wage slowdown and the income inequality it has caused is the fundamental economic challenge facing the country, according to aides who provided a preview of her remarks. The speech comes at a critical time for Mrs. Clinton, when one of her Democratic opponents in the 2016 race, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has surged in the polls and drawn big crowds with his populist message. Her speech won’t be in the same populist vein, aides said. Rather, she will lean heavily on proposals like paid family leave, incentives for corporations to expand profit sharing to employees, and an increase in the minimum wage. Mrs. Clinton will also come down hard on corporations (including Wall Street firms) that she will argue are too focused on quarterly returns to shareholders rather than on long-term investment in employees. She will call on the wealthiest Americans to pay more in taxes to help the country bridge the growing disparity between the top 1 percent of earners and a vast majority of Americans. The speech will be a blueprint for the policies she plans to talk about over the course of the campaign. But liberals looking for Mrs. Clinton to repeat her earlier economic speech, casting blame on the financial industry and providing detailed policies that would affect the big banks, may be disappointed. As one Clinton aide cautioned: “This is not her Wall Street speech.” By AMY CHOZICK and MAGGIE HABERMAN Mrs. Clinton, who plans to give her first major speech on the economy on Monday, also earned an endorsement from the American Federation of Teachers, a major teachersâ union.
