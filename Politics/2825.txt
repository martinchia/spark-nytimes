After a debate featuring several confrontations between the presidential candidates and the moderators, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, expressed extreme displeasure with the evening’s cable hosts. âI think it was one gotcha question, one personal low blow after the other,â he said of the CNBC team, speaking to reporters in the postdebate spin room. âItâs almost like they tried to design the Rubik’s Cube with every question â to take the worst element, I think, of what moderators and what the media should bring to the table.â  âAll I can tell you,â he continued, âis while Iâm proud of our candidates for pretty much sticking together, Iâm very disappointed in the moderators.â He ignored a question about whether the evening would affect the partyâs relationship with CNBC.
