Gov. John Kasich’s campaign promoted a “major” Monday announcement over the weekend, but the Republican presidential candidate from Ohio has no plans to unveil a suite of new policy proposals or initiatives.  Mr. Kasich will be in Birmingham, Ala., to ring in the endorsement of the state’s governor, Robert J. Bentley.  For Mr. Kasich, who is seen as a moderate in the Republican Party’s rambunctious field of candidates, the support of a governor from one of the country’s most conservative states could be a big help.  “I feel he can win, I really do,” Mr. Bentley told AL.com. “We’ve had some changes in attitudes and philosophies in the last eight years that maybe require that we move back a little to the center.” A late entry into the race, Mr. Kasich impressed voters at the Republican presidential debate this month. He has been steadily rising in polls and showing strength in important states such as New Hampshire. With Mr. Bentley’s backing, Mr. Kasich is showing that his appeal may be broader than some analysts anticipated.
