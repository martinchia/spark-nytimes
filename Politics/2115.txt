NASHUA, N.H. â Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio offered welcoming words to Michael R. Bloomberg on Saturday, suggesting that an independent run by the former New York City mayor could have a positive effect on the presidential race. Mr. Kasich, who has been appealing to centrist voters in New Hampshire, called Mr. Bloomberg a âgood mayorâ and said, “If he wants to run, he probably will stimulate the debate.â âI’m all in favor of that,â Mr. Kasich told reporters. âMaybe we could have  more serious debate instead of, you know, some of the things we see.â The New York Times reported on Saturday that Mr. Bloomberg was weighing a third-party bid for the presidency. Mr. Kasich spoke to reporters after appearing at a town hall-style event hosted by the New Hampshire Republican Party, which also attracted several other Republican candidates. âI like Michael,â Mr. Kasich said. âI mean, I’m not endorsing him, but I like him.” Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
