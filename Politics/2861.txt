Over the last week, in two interviews with The New York Times â one before his remarks about Senator John McCainâs time as a prisoner of war and one after â Donald J. Trump laid out his approach to the 2016 presidential campaign. Much of what Mr. Trump, a Republican presidential candidate, described about his view of the race and his candidacy involves the word âhugeâ â huge crowds, huge poll numbers, a huge message and a huge business acumen and brand that fuels his approach. The following are some of the unfiltered thoughts of Mr. Trump about policy, campaigning and his opponents: On his initial comments about illegal immigration: âFor one week nobody mentioned anything. I have now been apologized to by so many people. I have brought illegal immigration to the forefront. You have the jail break and all this stuff happened.â On criticisms from his rivals: âThe candidates who Iâm creaming in the pollsâ have stirred up outrage, citing former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas and others.  âYou get guys like Perry, he’s not registering, Bobby Jindal was very vehement â oh, bah bah. I think he’s at zero.â George Pataki hitting him on immigration: âYou know what that got him? Nothing.â On NBC severing ties with him: âThey were begging me to do the show. That’s why NBC’s angry at me. They’re angry at me because of that. So NBC’s angry at me because I ran for president.â On hiring pollsters: âI don’t want a pollster. Because if a pollster’s so good, why aren’t they running? I don’t need a pollster, I don’t want a pollster.â On Mr. McCain: âWhen I was in Phoenix last week, it was so crowded they had to turn thousands of people away and he called them crazies, and I was very offended he called them crazies.â On Mr. McCainâs military service: âI said, hey, what about the people that weren’t captured? And the truth is, nobody talks about them. What about the people that weren’t captured? Nobody talks about him.â On apologizing: âI always believe in apologizing if you’ve done something wrong but if you read my statement you’ll see I said nothing wrong. And I got the biggest ovation.â   On the virtues of spontaneous speaking: âSpeeches are much easier if you read them. I just find when I do that, itâs harder to fire up the crowd. I find that when I don’t have eye contact with the crowd it’s not as good. You canât make as good a speech when you are reading it as when you don’t have to.â On the political press corps: âThereâs great dishonesty in politics. Iâve always been covered by a press thatâs mostly financial press.â On his self-reliant approach: âI rely on myself very much,â he said. âI just think that you have an instinct and you go with it. Especially when it comes to deal-making and buying things.â On the Republican pollster Frank Luntz: âHeâs crazy,” he said about Mr. Luntz, who said Mr. Trump was booed after his remarks on Mr. McCain in Iowa. “Heâs a promoter. I got no boos. At least he admits I got a standing ovation. You donât get a standing ovation and get boos, by the way. They donât go hand in hand.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
