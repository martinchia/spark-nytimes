Hillary Rodham Clinton will appear on the Rev. Al Sharpton’s syndicated radio show on Thursday, the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act and the day of the first widely broadcast Republican debate.  Mr. Sharpton said that he thought it was fitting for Mrs. Clinton to “speak to black America” on his show on the anniversary of the act.  An aide to Mrs. Clinton confirmed the appearance.  Mr. Sharpton said he planned on asking her in detail about the Voting Rights Act, which Mrs. Clinton has made reference to repeatedly in her campaign.  At minimum, the appearance suggests a new level of engagement with Mr. Sharpton, who is close with President Obama, at a time when protesters involved with the “Black Lives Matter” movement have called on Democratic officials to address anger within the black community over longstanding tensions with the police.  Mr. Sharpton’s relationship with the Clintons over the years has been cordial but not close. But Mr. Sharpton, whose radio show is called “Keepin’ It Real,”  has become a powerful figure nationally partly because of his ties to the Obama administration.
