Senator Marco Rubio of Florida gave a taste of his stump speech to Secretary of State John F. Kerry on Thursday and, in response, was offered a lesson in diplomacy. During a hearing about the Iran nuclear deal at the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Mr. Rubio, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, argued that the Obama administration had capitulated to the Iranians by making the agreement and made the case that the world will be more dangerous. “I do fault the president for striking a terrible deal with Iran,” Mr. Rubio said, warning Iran that the next president has no obligation to uphold the agreement. Republicans in Congress are trying to gather enough support to override a presidential veto and block the deal from moving forward. Mr. Kerry, a former senator from Massachusetts who ran for president as the Democratic nominee in 2004, begged to differ with Mr. Rubio. He said that opponents of the deal had failed to come forward with an alternative that did not include military confrontation. Moreover, Mr. Kerry said, backing out of a deal would likely make future negotiations nearly impossible. “If you think the Ayatollah is going to come back and negotiate again with an American, thatâs fantasy,” Mr. Kerry said. “Youâre never going to see that because we will have proven we’re not trustworthy. You have 535 secretaries of state, you canât deal with anybody.”
