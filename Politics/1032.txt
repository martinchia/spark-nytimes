Senator Rand Paul has added an item to his online campaign store, which already includes N.S.A spy-cam blockers and âDonât Drone Me, Broâ shirts: a  signed copy of Hillary Rodham Clintonâs 2014 memoir, âHard Choices.â But the Paul campaign, with its usual playful approach that has included tweaking Jeb Bush with memes and taking a chainsaw to the tax code, has put Mrs. Clintonâs book in a special category: fiction. âGet Your Own Signed Copy of a Great Fiction Book!â the listing reads, with a screenshot of the title page signed by Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Paul. The book is being auctioned through eBay, with an opening bid of $250. Most autographed copies already on the auction site were going for less than $100 on Wednesday. Mr. Paul, along with his Republican rivals for president, received an autographed copy of the book as a joke from the Clinton campaign after the last Republican debate, when candidates questioned Mrs. Clinton’s accomplishments as secretary of state. So the Paul campaign decided to joke back. “Senator Rand Paul is a big fan of fiction,â said Sergio Gor, a spokesman for the Paul campaign. â’Hard Choices’ is a great example of revisionist history. We encourage everyone to bid and get their own copy now!” Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
