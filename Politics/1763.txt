Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, confirmed in an interview with The Financial Times that he was actively weighing an independent campaign for president in 2016. Mr. Bloomberg said he was âlooking at all the optionsâ in the election and lamented the state of the race. âI find the level of discourse and discussion distressingly banal and an outrage and an insult to the voters,â Mr. Bloomberg told the paper. The comments are Mr. Bloombergâs first public expression of interest in the presidential race, but aides acting on his instructions have already drawn up detailed plans for a possible campaign. The former mayorâs deliberations are about to enter a decisive phase: His aides said he intended to make a final call on the presidential race by early March, and planned to take a fresh round of polling after the New Hampshire primary to gauge the viability of a campaign. The most likely scenario for a Bloomberg run would be the selection of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont as the Democratic nominee, and Donald J. Trump or Senator Ted Cruz of Texas as the Republican pick.
