Former Gov. Rick Perry’s campaign continues to retrench. The Republican from Texas has whittled his staff in Iowa to one paid operative amid continuing fund-raising struggles, a spokeswoman for Mr. Perry confirmed.  Mr. Perry led in the polls for a stretch during his first presidential bid four years ago. He spent significant time boning up on foreign policy and getting himself in physical shape for the grinds of the campaign trail.  However, he has failed to generate excitement among voters in a crowded and more competitive Republican field. A Monmouth University poll on Monday showed Mr. Perry with support of 1 percent of likely Republican caucusgoers in Iowa. According to The Des Moines Register, most of Mr. Perry’s staff members have already joined other Republican organizations, with one signing on to work with former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. Mr. Perry had already trimmed staff in South Carolina and other crucial primary states. There were early signs of trouble in Iowa last week when Sam Clovis, his chairman in the state, left the campaign to join  Donald J. Trump’s staff.
