CONCORD, N.H. — The Marco Rubio Burger, a morsel containing two four-ounce patties, Cuban seasoning, arugula, tomatoes, candied bacon, key-lime mayonnaise and American cheese, went untouched by the man for whom it was named. “He didn’t want it, I guess,” said a staff member from the Barley House, where Mr. Rubio gave a short speech to 60 or 70 people, and sat down for an interview for the radio show “Pints and Politics” on WXKL. âWe have a Marco Rubio burger for you there,â said the show’s host, Chris Ryan. âIs that right? Whatâs in it?â Mr. Rubio said. âThereâs a couple, uh, Cubans in there,” Mr. Ryan said hesitantly, seeming unsure of what was actually in the burger. “We have some very nice aspects of that burger and some Brussels sprouts too. Itâs a good thing for you to take on the bus.â “Aspects,” it seemed, didn’t appeal to Mr. Rubio. During their interview, Mr. Ryan asked the senator about whether his string of repetitions about President Obama during Saturday’s Republican debate was being taken out of context. Mr. Rubio jumped at the chance to counterattack Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who had accused him of being unable to do anything but spout off a “25-second memorized speech” when put on the spot. “If youâre Chris Christie, and you supported gun control, gave a personal contribution to Planned Parenthood, supported Sonia Sotomayorâs appointment to the Supreme Court, and are a big strong proponent of Common Core, you canât run on your record,” Mr. Rubio said. “Youâre going to have to figure out some sort of side narrative you can create.” After hitting back at Mr. Christie, Mr. Rubio said he was surprised that more Republicans weren’t echoing his chorus that Mr. Obama “knows exactly what he is doing.” And he didn’t show signs of laying off the line.  “The bottom line is, yes, Iâm going to keep saying the same thing, because itâs the truth. Itâs what I deeply believe. Barack Obama has done damage to this country,â Mr. Rubio said.
