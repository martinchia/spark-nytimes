Two months after announcing a presidential bid in which he promised to “wreak havoc” upon Washington, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin is ending his run. After a promising start in Iowa, the Harley-Davidson-riding candidate failed to gain traction nationally with his promises of repealing the Affordable Care Act and taking the fight to unions. As happened with former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, the first Republican to drop out of a crowded field, Mr. Walker was overshadowed by the emergence of Donald J. Trump, making it difficult for his message to break through the political noise.  Big in Iowa
Seven months before officially joining the race, Mr. Walker lifted the hopes of supporters with a rousing speech in January at the Freedom Summit in Iowa. He drew rave reviews from potential caucusgoers, who were impressed by the combative stance he took with unions in Wisconsin and his promises to be bold. âThe Occupy movement started in Madison, Wisconsin, four years ago and then went to Wall Street,â he said of his battles with teachers unions and protestors. âSo my apologies for that.â The Punt
While Mr. Walker’s everyman persona showed early appeal to social conservatives, it was clear in February during a trip to London that the governor might not be ready for the global stage. During a policy talk at a British think tank, Mr. Walker said he was uncomfortable discussing foreign affairs while traveling overseas. Things got more uncomfortable when he was asked about evolution and responded,  âIâm going to punt on that one.â The (Dark) Money
Things were looking rosy for Mr. Walker in April, when it emerged that he was an early favorite of the billionaire Koch brothers. “When the primaries are over and Scott Walker gets the nomination,â David Koch said during a fund-raiser, signaling which candidate had won his heart. Although the Kochs have declined to endorse a candidate, it appeared at the time that Mr. Walker’s bid would be well funded.  The Strategy
A strategist at heart, Mr. Walker was plotting how to outlast former Gov. Jeb Bush and Senator Marco Rubio, both from Florida, in May. Boasting that he liked to be unconventional, he suggested on Laura Ingraham’s radio show that he might not bother to invest in winning Florida’s primary, allowing the two Floridians to deplete their resources fighting each other in the state. “Iâve been unconventional, so I donât write it off. But we have a ways to go before even considering something like that,â Mr. Walker said. The Announcement
In July, Mr. Walker took to a stage in Waukesha, Wis., and embraced the image of an outsider who knows how to fight. Announcing his White House bid, Mr. Walker vowed to expand his conservative agenda nationally and undo many of President Obama’s policies, starting with the Affordable Care Act. “We need new, fresh leadership, leadership with big, bold ideas from outside of Washington,â Mr. Walker said to cheers from several thousand inside the Waukesha County Expo Center. âThe kind of leadership that knows how to get things done, like weâve done here in Wisconsin.â The Trump Factor
While Mr. Walker was supposed to be the outsider who would “wreak havoc” on Washington, it was Mr. Trump who stole the headlines this summer. Mr. Walker’s image, which he described as “aggressively” normal, wore thin in Iowa and polls showed Mr. Trump taking a lead in the state, which the governor had been counting on to create momentum for his campaign. In August, SkyBridge Capitalâs Anthony Scaramucci, a top fund-raiser for Mr. Walker, met with Mr. Trump and, according to the Wall Street Journal, discussed endorsing him before professing his loyalty to Mr. Walker. In the presidential debate last week, Mr. Walker tried to attack Mr. Trump directly, unleashing the zinger, “We don’t need an apprentice in the White House.” The No Show
Mr. Walker’s absence was the talk of the Mackinac Republican Leadership Conference in Michigan in mid-September. He had canceled plans to give a keynote speech so that he could focus on Iowa, and then reinstated himself after some donors reached out to him. He then canceled again at the last minute citing bad weather. Some at the conference joked that he could no longer afford the fuel to fly himself to the island resort where the gathering was taking place. The End
A CNN/ORC poll released Sunday showed that Mr. Walker’s support among Republicans had dropped below one percent nationally, signaling that the end was near.  By THE NEW YORK TIMES Donald J. Trump officially accepted the Republican party's nomination on July 22. Hillary Clinton was officially nominated on July 26 at the Democratic Convention. Highlights of the political career of Gov.
