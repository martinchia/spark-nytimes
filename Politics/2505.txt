Two weeks ago, invitations flew over email for a Chris Christie debate watch party and fund-raiser.  “You’re invited to a private showing of the first debate in the 2016 Republican presidential primary debate series,” the invitation read in large type, urging people to come to the Iron Bar in Morristown, N.J. Less than 24 hours until Fox News makes clear which candidates will be included in the prime-time debate, and which will be relegated to the television version of the kids’ table, it is not entirely clear that Mr. Christie, the governor of New Jersey, will make the main event.  Mr. Christie was stuck in the bottom rung in a recent national poll, conducted by The Wall Street Journal and NBC, tied at 3 percent with Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio and Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas.  Mr. Christie and his aides remain confident that they will make it into the top 10 spots based on an average of five recent national surveys, the criteria Fox News is using.  The polls are expected to include a Fox News survey released on Monday evening that showed Mr. Christie and Mr. Kasich both squeaking into the top 10, and Mr. Perry joining the second-tier group.  After 5 p.m. on Tuesday, the network’s “decision desk,” which came into sharp relief on election night in 2012 when its members stood by their calling the election for President Obama after the Republican strategist Karl Rove contested it, will make its decision public about who made the 9 p.m. debate slot, and which polls were used. Mr. Christie’s aides seem to have clarity on their plan of action, but aides to candidates like Mr. Perry do not. Mr. Perry’s advisers declined to elaborate on how aggressively they have made their case to Fox News officials, who said they are in frequent contact with every campaign.  âConsistent with past years, weâre in regular communication with both the Republican and Democratic campaigns, about logistics, campaign appearance times, and upcoming debate issues,” Michael Clemente, the executive vice president of news at Fox News, said in a statement. According to network officials, the debate rules will include one-minute answers by the candidates. A candidate will have a 30-second rebuttal if his name is mentioned, a scenario that could eat into a lot of time. There will also be one-minute closing statements, and a question through Facebook, one of the debate’s sponsors, roughly every 15 minutes. So far, Mr. Perry’s team appears to have done little planning for debate watch parties. The frustration from some of his allies is palpable, especially as Mr. Kasich has risen in recent polls after his late July campaign kickoff. Mr. Kasich is said to be a favorite of Rupert Murdoch, although people involved in planning the debate insist the only factors in deciding the participants are the polling and other criteria that the candidates must meet. Perhaps more significantly, Mr. Kasich is the governor of Ohio, where the debate is taking place, and the state Republican Party is involved in hosting the event. If he doesn’t make the debate stage, it will be uncomfortable.   Some campaigns, such as Carly Fiorina’s, are frustrated with the wide margins of error in some of the national surveys, which make it harder to discern a clear level of support.  “If Iâm Ted Cruz or Mike Huckabee I can either read” some of the polls with wide margins of error “as being among the top tier or down at just 1 percent,” said Keith Appell, a top adviser to Ms. Fiorina, who is not expected to make the prime-time debate. “What’s the point?”
