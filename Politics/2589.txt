Good Friday morning from Washington. The Republican candidates will spread out this weekend for events in crucial voting states, while Hillary Rodham Clinton offers hints of her campaign strategy, at least where her husband and daughter are concerned. But all eyes are on the Senate this weekend, as time has nearly run out on a security bill. The Senate is heading for a tense and unusual Sunday showdown over the expiring antiterrorism surveillance powers of the National Security Agency, and Senator Mitch McConnell, five months into his tenure as majority leader, has a lot on the line. Despite strong bipartisan support in the Senate for a House-passed overhaul, Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has held out against the legislation in favor of an extension of current programs even as a federal appeals court recently questioned the constitutionality of the N.S.A. approach. The Senate ended up in a post-midnight stalemate over the N.S.A. just before its Memorial Day recess. Now Mr. McConnell has called his colleagues back for the first Sunday meeting since late 2013, to try to untangle the mess just hours before a June 1 deadline. The outcome is far from certain. Senator Rand Paul, the junior Republican senator from Mr. McConnell’s home state, is opposed to both an extension of the current law and the House bill unless significant changes are made. And while the House measure is tantalizingly close to the 60 votes needed to advance, Mr. McConnell and Senator Richard M. Burr, the North Carolina Republican who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, remain opposed to it. So while passage of that measure is probably the Senate’s easiest way out, it might not happen without Mr. McConnell’s blessing. It should make for a riveting Sunday in the Senate, as Mr. McConnell and his colleagues try to prevent the lapse of major antiterrorism programs while Republicans who pride themselves on national security control the House and Senate.  — Carl Hulse Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. In the absence of a large gathering this weekend, the Republican candidates and hopefuls have scattered across the country. Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida heads to Nashville to give the keynote speech at a Republican dinner. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin will visit New Hampshire, while Mr. Cruz also adds a trip to Maine. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida finishes a trip to Nevada, and Mr. Paul heads to South Carolina. And finally, Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, will address the Republican state convention in Delaware. On Friday, President Obama will meet at the White House with Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch, who announced on Wednesday the indictments on corruption charges of several soccer officials, including from FIFA, the sport’s governing body. Iowa will be a crucial foothold for many candidates, including the former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who will both be in the state on Friday. With the fight over Mr. Obama’s trade push shifting to the House, organized labor groups are getting personal with their attacks on the Democrats whose support the president needs to win. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. will begin broadcasting advertisements in the California district of Representative Ami Bera, who has twice narrowly won election and who came out this month in favor of the trade promotion authority. “Congressman Ami Bera will do anything to keep his job, including sending your job overseas,” says a voice in the ad, in the dark tones the union usually reserves for Republicans. A union-led coalition has vowed to keep Democrats united against the legislation, which should come to a vote in the House in June. So far, advertising has run in only one district, that of Representative David E. Price of North Carolina. But that ad merely implores Congress to oppose “bad trade deals.â The Bera ad is more cutting. The Democrats who support the bill worry that such tactics will be effective. “I know a number of folks who say itâs the right thing to do, but are concerned about some of the tactics and maneuvers of organized labor” said Representative Gregory W. Meeks of New York and an ally of the president on trade. “I’d be lying if I said that didn’t matter.” Mr. Bera responded to the A.F.L.-C.I.O. by saying that the new version of the bill had addressed his concerns on worker and environmental protections, among other things. âI’m supporting this T.P.A.,â he said of the trade promotion authority, âbecause I believe allowing the president to negotiate an agreement could lead to a good deal for America that would create good-paying jobs in Sacramento County and grow our economy.” — Jonathan Weisman Republicans in Ohio have made a play to improve the chances of Gov. John R. Kasich if he runs for president, agreeing to delay the stateâs 2016 primary by a week to create a winner-takes-all contest for its delegates. This week the State Senate voted in accord with its House of Representatives to move the primary to March 15 from March 8. That would put it in the company of Florida, Missouri and potentially Illinois, and shift it beyond the threshold of states whose delegates are allotted on a proportional basis. For the change to take effect, Mr. Kasich, who has repeatedly said he is considering a run for president, must sign it into law. Although Mr. Kasich lacks the national profile of some other Republican hopefuls, analysts say that anything can happen in such a crowded field. For Mr. Kasich, a full haul of delegates from his home state would be crucial to winning the nomination. And while Ohio remains one of the most closely watched general election swing states, delaying its primary would give it more clout during the nomination process. âFor anybody who is worried that Ohio didnât have enough influence in presidential elections already, this should set your mind at ease,â said Daniel P. Tokaji, an election law professor at Ohio State University. — Alan Rappeport After Bill Clinton accepted a lifetime achievement award at the Happy Hearts Fund gala in June 2014, the Clinton Foundation sent a $500,000 invoice to the charity, run by the model Petra Nemcova, seeking a donation. Mr. Obama held a Twitter chat session in Miami on Thursday, covering, among other topics, the link between extreme weather and climate change, his contested trade policy and the N.B.A. playoffs. George E. Pataki, the former governor of New York, announced his candidacy on Thursday, setting in motion what is seen as a long-shot bid, in part because of his support for gay and abortion rights. And Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who two years ago said he was among the governors âleading the chargeâ for the Common Core education standards, said on Thursday that the state could abandon them. It is a change in position that comes as he tries to reconcile policies he embraced as the governor of a blue state with his bid to win over conservative voters in the presidential campaign. There are six main reasons the Republican field is so crowded, The Christian Science Monitor argues, including the lack of a clear front-runner and the fact “some candidates aren’t really running for president.” The Wall Street Journal compares Mrs. Clinton‘s emphasis so far in this campaign with that of her 2008 run: “In 2008, she played down that she was a woman running for president; now she regularly talks about women and childrenâs issues.” And a United States District Court judge “blasted the Obama administration’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit” brought by House Republicans over the Affordable Care Act, Reuters reported. Senator Rand Paul is struggling to raise money, as big-money donors in Silicon Valley are failing to write checks for his presidential bid, Politico reported. The Clinton family roadshow will hit the campaign trail before the year is out. Mr. Clinton and Chelsea Clinton have not been a visible part of Mrs. Clinton‘s slowly accelerating campaign since she declared her candidacy in April. But both are expected to be at her kickoff rally on June 13. Neither the former president nor the couple’s daughter will hold events on Mrs. Clinton’s behalf for several months, according to a campaign official, giving the candidate some room to operate on her own. But they will become more visible as Mrs. Clinton expands on her proposals in the 2016 campaign. — Maggie Haberman Like the Politics Newsletter? Get it delivered to your inbox.
