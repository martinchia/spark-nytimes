Good Wednesday morning from Washington, where Congress is debating an education law and where another Republican has said he just might join the race for the White House. It is a crowded race, after all, where the full picture is hidden among polling numbers and money raised, and where a first crucial deadline is just around the corner. With less than 30 days until the first Republican presidential primary debate in Ohio, the jockeying for a spot will only intensify. So will the hunt for campaign cash. Among the so-called establishment lane of presidential candidates â Jeb Bush, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin â only Mr. Rubio has been in the race for a substantial length of time. Mr. Walker won’t officially declare his candidacy until Monday, and Mr. Bush has been a formal candidate for only a few weeks. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has announced that he raised about $10 million since he entered the race at the end of March, and another roughly $40 million from the “super PAC” that is allowed to raise unlimited donations to support him. Among Democrats, Hillary Rodham Clinton‘s team said she had raised $45 million, a figure that is likely to dwarf candidates on both sides of the aisle. Her chief rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, raised $15 million, almost entirely from small-dollar donors. Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland who entered the race at the end of May, has not yet said what he’s raised. But the money will not necessarily paint a full picture on its own. The Federal Election Commission finance filings become public on July 15 and will reveal how much each campaign has spent, in addition to the so-called burn rate â cash raised compared with money spent. They will also shed light on infrastructure. With three weeks left for Republicans to qualify for the debates, the contours of the race will become clearer. â Maggie Haberman Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. A day after President Obama met at the White House with the leader of Vietnam’s Communist Party, congressional leaders will commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Vietnam War with a ceremony at the Capitol building. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina will speak at the Atlantic Council in Washington, as part of the group’s “America’s Role in the World” series. Jake Tapper of CNN will moderate. And on the trail, Mr. O’Malley and Jeb Bush are in New Hampshire, Mr. Bush at a town-hall-style meeting and Mr. O’Malley attending, among other events, the popular beer-and-politics-style meeting. Mr. Rubio has a full day of appearances in Iowa. For the first time in the 14 years since the initial passage of No Child Left Behind, the signature Bush-era education law that ushered in an era of bitter controversy over the use of high-stakes standardized testing to measure school progress, Congress is close to passing a new version of the law. But watch the money. This week, the Senate began debate on a bipartisan bill drafted by Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, and Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, who are the first senators who have managed to get legislation overhauling the program onto the floor since the original legislation of 2001. The House, which has had better luck over the years, has struggled to get its own bill passed this year, largely because it has failed to attract Democrats or enough conservatives to put it over the top. The two chambers will most likely end up with pretty dissimilar bills. While there has been substantial focus on policy differences â Democrats loathe the so-called school choice items that Republicans seek â one of the biggest missing pieces is the money. The Senateâs bill is funded at âsuch sums as may be necessary,â which suggests that spending levels would need to be worked out in negotiations between the House and the Senate. In contrast, the House Republican proposal would cap spending on the act for the next six years at current levels. Expect to hear more on that divide this week. â Jennifer Steinhauer  Bruised by single-digit showings in recent rounds of polls, Mr. OâMalley returns to the campaign trail on Wednesday for six events in New Hampshire. Mr. OâMalleyâs campaign has been looking to reinsert him into a Democratic political conversation that has recently been dominated by Mr. Sandersâs gaining momentum in the race against Mrs. Clinton. While Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have revealed impressive fund-raising hauls so far, Mr. OâMalley, the former governor of Maryland, has remained silent about his campaignâs finances. He has been increasingly vocal on subjects that might appeal to his partyâs liberal wing, unveiling a restrained foreign policy while weighing in on Puerto Ricoâs debt problems and even the Glass-Steagall Act in an effort to recapture some luster. âMartin OâMalley is 2016 ideas candidate â leading from the front with bold, progressive ideas,â Lis Smith, his deputy campaign manager, said on Twitter, imploring the political media to take note. Despite his early struggles to gain traction, Democrats in New Hampshire say it is too soon to count Mr. OâMalley out. Raymond Buckley, the chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, compares Mr. OâMalley to former Senator Gary Hart, whose upset victory there damaged Walter Mondale’s aura of inevitability. A young Mr. OâMalley was a volunteer on that campaign. âI think he understands what it takes,â Mr. Buckley said. âThis is not a sprint. Itâs a long race. Thereâs a lot of time between now and February.â â Alan Rappeport Mrs. Clinton gave her first national television interview since declaring her 2016 candidacy, criticizing Republicans for not seeking a pathway to citizenship for immigrants living in the country illegally and underscoring the issue’s importance in the campaign. Congressional Republicans are using the budget process to try to dismantle Mr. Obamaâs policies, setting up a fiscal feud this fall that could lead to a government shutdown. And in a speech in Chicago, Mr. Rubio laid out an economic blueprint that will be central to his campaign, calling for dismantling the âcartel of existing colleges and universitiesâ that he said left too many students without viable career paths and burdened by tens of thousands of dollars in debt. As Donald J. Trump continues to see businesses and fellow Republican candidates distance themselves from him over comments he made about immigrants, one of his competitors, Carly Fiorina, joined in the distancing, but warned, National Review writes, that he “had to be taken seriously as a candidate because of his money and presence on the campaign trail.” In 2014, Politico reports, Ben Carson made “nearly $2 million delivering inspirational speeches to faith-based groups like Christian high schools and pregnancy centers.” And Mr. O’Malley wrote an op-ed article in Time, arguing that “Americaâs role in the world is to advance the cause of a global middle class,” and that though the nation might be weary from more than a decade of war and crisis abroad, “our countryâs security and prosperity demand that we be more engaged in the world, not less.” Mr. Trump gets four Pinocchios from The Washington Post fact checker for his claim that immigrants are responsible for disproportionate levels of crime. Politico looks at whether Mr. Walker‘s inability to finish college would make him a bad president. James S. Gilmore III, a former Virginia governor, said on Tuesday that he was “very likely” to pursue another presidential bid and would formally announce his intentions during the first week of August. Mr. Gilmore, a Republican, sought his party’s nomination in the 2008 campaign but dropped out to run for the Senate, a race he lost. “It’s a different field, different time and there are different issues now,” he said in regard to why he thought he would have more success in this bid. A former Army intelligence officer, Mr. Gilmore served a single term as governor, the maximum allowed under state law, and also led a federal commission on terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. He is now the chief executive of the Free Congress Foundation, a conservative think tank. He said he had been disappointed that the current field of candidates had not offered specific solutions on national security and the economy. “There needs to be a conversation about the real crises facing the country,” Mr. Gilmore said. â Jonathan Martin Like the Politics Newsletter?
