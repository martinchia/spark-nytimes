The president gave remarks on the Iran nuclear deal at American University. As my colleague Julie Hirschfeld Davis reports, President Obama on Wednesday cast the debate over the deal to constrain Iran’s nuclear program as a choice “between diplomacy and some sort of war.” In an hour-long speech at American University in Washington, Mr. Obama reminded Americans that several prominent critics of the deal with Iran, whose views are to be amplified in $25 million in television advertising, were also staunch advocates for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.  “If the rhetoric in these ads and the accompanying commentary sounds familiar, it should,” the president said in remarks the White House chose to highlight on social networks. “For many of the same people who argued for the war in Iraq are now making the case against the Iran nuclear deal,” which was negotiated by the United States, Iran and five other world powers. "Many of the same people who argued for the war in Iraq are now making the case against the #IranDeal."â@POTUS //t.co/dLN9crJfJk — The Iran Deal  (@TheIranDeal) August 5, 2015  Mr. Obama, who opposed what he called in late 2002 “a dumb war,” went on to enumerate the costs of that protracted conflict in the Middle East.  Later, Mr. Obama said that “every nation in the world that has commented publicly, with the exception of the Israeli government, has expressed support” for the deal. The president added that he knew that Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was a staunch opponent of the accord. “I do not doubt his sincerity, but I believe he is wrong,” Mr. Obama said. On Tuesday, Mr. Netanyahu told American Jewish groups, “The claim that we oppose this deal because we want war is not just false, it’s outrageous.” He added: “Israel wants to dismantle Iranâs nuclear program, and Israel wants peace. This deal will advance neither goal.” This year, Secretary of State John Kerry tried to undermine the prime minister’s credibility by recalling that Mr. Netanyahu had offered expert testimony to Congress on Sept. 12, 2002, when he was a private citizen, in which he had advocated a United States invasion of Iraq. By ROBERT MACKEY Secretary of State John Kerry recalled that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel strongly supported the United Statesâ invasion of Iraq. “If you take out Saddam, Saddamâs regime, I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region,â Mr. Netanyahu said at the time. âAnd I think that people sitting right next door in Iran, young people, and many others, will say the time of such regimes, of such despots, is gone.â
