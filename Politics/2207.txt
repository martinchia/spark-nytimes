Gov. Scott Walker discusses his Reagan-inspired policies and what sets him apart from the other Republican presidential candidates with CNBCâs John Harwood. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin called himself “aggressively normal” in the first Republican presidential debate â and saw his poll numbers go backward. Now he’s highlighting the “aggressive” part.  In an interview with John Harwood in Manchester, N.H., he hit his Republican rival John Kasich, assailing his expansion of Medicaid as governor of Ohio, calling it “precisely what’s wrong” with government. He accused Republican senators, including Marco Rubio of Florida, of “procedural talk” in saying they can’t repeal the Affordable Care Act during President Obama’s tenure, and said Hillary Rodham Clinton’s handling of her email as secretary of state disqualifies her from the White House race.  As for the mood of American voters, the scrappy Mr. Walker declared, “Right now people do want a fight.” Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
