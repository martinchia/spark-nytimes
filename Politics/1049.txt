The contretemps between former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Donald J. Trump spilled over onto theÂ Sunday talk shows as Mr. Trump suggested that he, unlike former President George W. Bush, would have prevented the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and Mr. Bush accused Mr. Trump of behaving as if he were still on the set of his reality TV show. âLook, look,â Mr. Trump told Chris Wallace on âFox NewsÂ Sunday.â âJeb said, âWe were safe with my brother. We were safe.â Well, the World Trade Center just fell down.â Pressed about what he would have done differently, Mr. Trump seemed to say that his toughness as a leader would have intimidated the terrorists from entering the country in the first place. âI am extremely, extremely tough on illegal immigration. Iâm extremely tough on people coming into this country,” he said. “I believe that if I were running things, I doubt those families would have â I doubt that those people would have been in the country.â Mr. Bush, speaking to CNNÂ on Sunday, sounded exasperated. âI donât know why he keeps bringing this up,â he said. âAcross the spectrum of foreign policy, Mr. Trump talks about things that â as though heâs still on âThe Apprentice.â â He said Mr. Trump might next try to blame Franklin D. Roosevelt for Pearl Harbor. âIt just calls into question Mr. Trumpâs credibility as a commander in chief,â Mr. Bush said. The exchange came after Mr. Bushâs campaign released a web video called âJudgmentâ on Saturday, reminding viewers that the president controls the United Statesâ nuclear arsenal and then showing clips of Mr. Trump boasting about his military expertise (despite having never served in uniform), saying he watches television talk shows to gain knowledge about the military and denigrating Senator John McCainâs war record.
