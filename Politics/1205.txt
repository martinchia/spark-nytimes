After a Hispanic man was beaten Wednesday by two Boston men, one of whom told the police that he was inspired by Donald J. Trumpâs anti-immigrant message, Mr. Trump told reporters that his supporters were âpassionate.â Two brothers from South Boston were arrested and charged with beating the 58-year-old man, who is homeless, with a metal pole, breaking his nose and battering his chest and arms, The Boston Globe reported. âDonald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported,â the police said one of the brothers, Scott Leader, 38, told them. His brother, Steve Leader, 30, was also charged in the beating, the police said. The Globe reported that the brothers have extensive criminal records. Told of the attack, which also left the man soaked in urine, Mr. Trump said at a news conference late Wednesday that it was the first he had heard of it. âIt would be a shame,â Mr. Trump said, before adding: âI will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again. They are passionate.â The episode is not the first time that Mr. Trumpâs inflammatory comments have been cited in connection with violence. Following his public feud after the Republican presidential debate with Megyn Kelly, the Fox News anchor, she received death threats from Mr. Trumpâs fans and the cable network provided her with additional security. Mr. Trump brushed off the idea that his supporters were crossing the line. âI’m sure they don’t mean that,â he said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. âI had heard that had happened. But I have gained such respect for the people that like me and respect me and that like my views, it’s incredible.â
