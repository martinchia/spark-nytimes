Martin O’Malley, who is struggling to gain traction in the Democratic presidential contest, accused the Democratic National Committee on Wednesday of tipping the scales in Hillary Rodham Clinton’s favor by limiting the number of debates to six.  “I want to say right off the bat here, that to those in Washington who think they can limit the number of debates,” Mr. O’Malley said as he campaigned in Iowa, according to a transcript provided by his aides, “they’re gonna have another thing coming when they talk to the people of Iowa.” He added: “Because these are the issues about which we need to have not just one debate, not just two, but many debates. Because those debates will shape the future of the country we give our kids. Don’t you agree?” Mr. O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, and some of the other Democratic candidates have pushed for more debates. In the past, Mr. O’Malley’s supporters have accused the national commitee, which is theoretically neutral in the primary, of taking actions that benefit Mrs. Clinton.  Holly Shulman, a committee spokeswoman, said: “We believe that six debates will give plenty of opportunity for the candidates to be seen side by side. Iâm sure there will be lots of other forums for the candidates to make their case to voters, and that they will make the most out of every opportunity.”  Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
