Jeb Bush will outline his proposal on Tuesday to replace President Obamaâs health care law, calling for greater state authority over health policies and for a tax credit for the purchase of âaffordable, portable health plansâ for catastrophic medical events. According to the campaign, Mr. Bush, who will detail his plan during a speech in New Hampshire, would revamp the Food and Drug Administrationâs âregulatory morassâ and increase funding for the National Institutes of Health. He is also proposing an increase in contribution limits and uses for health savings accounts to address out-of-pocket costs and a cap on the tax exclusion of employer plans. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Mr. Bush, Allie Brandenburger, said Mr. Obamaâs law âepitomizes why Americans are fed up with Washington,â calling it âa government takeover of more than one-sixth of the American economy.â Mr. Bush, who has aimed to position himself as the most policy-oriented candidate in the Republican field, did not detail precisely how he would go about repealing the law, the Affordable Care Act. During a campaign stop in Iowa last week, he suggested that it would prove so unpopular that it would âcollapse under its own weight.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
