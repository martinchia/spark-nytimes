Two can play at this game, Senator Cruz. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has stepped up the attacks on his colleague and rival for the Republican nomination, Ted Cruz of Texas, accusing him of trying to cut the military budget and gut the nation’s intelligence programs. It was the latest episode of verbal boxing — in campaign speeches, interviews and online videos — between the two senators, which started in earnest last week when Mr. Cruz criticized Mr. Rubio during the Republican debate in Milwaukee. Saying in an interview on Wednesday with the radio host Hugh Hewitt that Mr. Cruz was “someone I like personally,” Mr. Rubio went after Mr. Cruz for several votes he had taken on military and national security issues. “We get along, we share a lot of views,” Mr. Rubio said.  “On some of the defense issues, weâve parted ways,” he added. “For the first few years in the Senate that heâs been there, heâs voted for budgets that have hurt the military. He voted for a budget that basically gutted our foreign aid program, particularly our defense of the Israelis and of aid that we provided them.”  Mr. Cruz has reserved his most aggressive attacks on Mr. Rubio over his role in writing and supporting an immigration overhaul bill, essentially calling it nothing more than warmed-over proposals from the Democratic Party.  If Mr. Cruz is going to run to Mr. Rubio’s right on immigration, Mr. Rubio seems intent on running to Mr. Cruz’s right on military and national security. He even attacked the Texas senator for working “with the Democrats, like Chuck Schumer and the A.C.L.U.,” in opposing the National Security Agency’s bulk data collection program. In Mr. Cruz’s descriptions of the immigration debate on Capitol Hill, however, Mr. Schumer, the New York Democrat, is not his ally but Mr. Rubio’s.
