With China’s currency devaluation and stock market downturn rattling American markets, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin on Monday called on President Obama to cancel the visit of China’s leader,  President Xi Jinping, to Washington next month. Mr. Walker’s call comes as Republican presidential candidates have been stepping up their criticism of China in recent days, with Donald J. Trump leading the charge.  Mr. Walker, who has been struggling to regain ground lost to Mr. Trump in recent polls, said that Mr. Obama must “focus on holding China accountable” on a range of issues, from cyberattacks to the persecution of Christians to unfairly manipulating its economy in ways that damage the United States. âAmericans are struggling to cope with the fall in today’s markets driven in part by China’s slowing economy and the fact that they actively manipulate their economy. Rather than honoring Chinese President Xi Jinping with an official state visit next month, President Obama should focus on holding China accountable over its increasing attempts to undermine U.S. interests. Given Chinaâs massive cyberattacks against America, its militarization of the South China Sea, continued state interference with its economy, and persistent persecution of Christians and human rights activists, President Obama needs to cancel the state visit. There’s serious work to be done rather than pomp and circumstance.” The state visit to the United States will be Mr. Xi’s first as China’s leader.
