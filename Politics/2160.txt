Updated, 2:09 p.m. | As rumors swirled Tuesday that Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee, would endorse Donald J. Trump in Iowa, the former Alaska governor posted on Twitter a link to a comment from her daughter Bristol slamming Senator Ted Cruz, who holds a slim lead over Mr. Trump in the polls there. Is THIS Why People Donât like Cruz? https://t.co/Qv3iih071S — Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) January 19, 2016  “Is THIS why people don’t like Cruz?” Sarah Palin asked in her Twitter message, with a link to a blog post by her daughter under that headline.  I like @TedCruz, but maybe THIS why people donât? https://t.co/1cCwjRYjMt @RealDonaldTrump @SarahPalinUSA — Bristol Palin (@BristolsBlog) January 19, 2016  Bristol Palin, in the blog item, teased the speculation about her mother’s intentions. “Is my mom going to endorse Donald Trump for president of the United States?” Bristol Palin wrote. “Thatâs the rumor, and Iâve been too busy with diapers to delve too much into politics these days. But the rumors were enough to cause staffers from Ted Cruzâs office to slam my mom.” She pointed to an assertion by Rick Tyler, Mr. Cruz’s spokesman, on CNN, that supporting Mr. Trump would align Sarah Palin, “a champion for the conservative cause,” with “someone who’s held progressive views all their life on the sanctity of life, on marriage, on partial-birth abortion.” Bristol Palin said that she didn’t know whether the endorsement would happen, but that what Mr. Cruz’s camp was now saying about her mother “makes me hope my mom does endorse Trump.” Mr. Trump has a rally set for 6 p.m. Eastern time in Ames, Iowa, which is being billed as a “major announcement” with a “special guest.” Despite her waning pull within the Republican Party, Sarah Palin is still a Tea Party favorite and would provide Mr. Trump with valuable currency at a moment when Mr. Cruz is attacking him over his conservative bona fides. Ms. Palin also remains a magnet of controversy and intrigue that could help Mr. Trump maximize his attention ahead of the Feb. 1 caucuses. In an effort to maintain the suspense, Mr. Trump earlier Tuesday would not reveal who would be accompanying him. âIâm a big fan of Sarah Palin, but Iâm not saying who it is,â he said. âI think everyone will be very impressed.â But the Cruz campaign appeared prepared either way.  I love @SarahPalinUSA  Without her support, I wouldn't be in the Senate. Regardless of what she does in 2016, I will always be a big fan. — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) January 19, 2016  Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
