Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has an open invitation to participate in the first Democratic presidential debate next month. According to criteria released by CNN, the network that is hosting the debate on Oct. 13, Mr. Biden would have until the next day to file a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission. The rules apply to any prospective candidate who is polling higher than 1 percent. CNN has already extended invitations to Lincoln Chafee, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Martin O’Malley, Bernie Sanders and Jim Webb to participate in the debate, which will take place in Las Vegas and will be moderated by Anderson Cooper. The debate will be the first of six that have been sanctioned by the Democratic National Committee. Mr. O’Malley and Mr. Sanders have called for additional debates, arguing that there should be more opportunities for lesser-known candidates to face off against Mrs. Clinton in person. Although the debate criteria are not explicitly designed to accommodate Mr. Biden, they leave him with leeway to draw out his decision over a run to the middle of next month without missing the opportunity to take part in the first formal gathering of the Democratic candidates. Mr. Biden said last week that he continues to wrestle with the decision as he grieves the recent death of his son Beau. He said that he needs to feel as if it would be a good thing for his family, and acknowledged that he might run out of time as the election cycle gathers pace. “Itâs just not quite there yet and it might not get there in time to make it feasible to run and succeed because there are certain windows that will close,â Mr. Biden told America Magazine. âIf thatâs it, thatâs it. Itâs not like I can rush it.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
