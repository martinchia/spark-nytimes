NASHVILLE â Senator Ted Cruz said Tuesday that Donald J. Trump âmay well be right that this is turning more and more into a two-man raceâ — delivering an unsubtle elbow to Senator Marco Rubio, who trails the two men in most polls, without naming him. Noting Mr. Trumpâs comments on Sunday, when he said on NBC’s âMeet the Pressâ that the Republican primary contest âlooks like a two-person race because everyone else is way behind,â Mr. Cruz did not hesitate to endorse the idea. âI did think it was interesting Donald said a couple of days ago that he thought that the Republican race could come down to just him and me,â Mr. Cruz told reporters after a rally here. âAnd I think he may well be right.â Mr. Cruz, who has remained relentlessly deferential to Mr. Trump in his public comments, though not as generous in private, declined to weigh in on the billionaireâs most recent controversy, his vulgar comments about Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries and the bathroom trip that delayed her return to the stage at Saturday’s debate. âI will note from the very beginning, our friends in the media have been trying to get me to play political pundit,â said Mr. Cruz, who has in fact often relished the role, regularly describing process and campaign strategy with reporters and making predictions about how the race may play out. He added, âIâm not interested in throwing rocks at anybody in this race.â He did note, when describing the prospect of a showdown with Mr. Trump, that voters would have to focus on a central question that would seem to serve the Cruz cause: âWho has been a consistent conservative?â At an earlier stop on Tuesday in Knoxville, Tenn., Mr. Cruz said that a possible two-person race with Mr. Trump âpresents a good choice to the American people.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
