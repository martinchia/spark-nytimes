Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has said he will not take shots at his Republican rivals for the presidency, but on Thursday he questioned descriptions of Jeb Bush as a “front-runner” and wondered whether Mr. Bush could win an early state in the nominating contests.  Mr. Cruz, who declared his 2016 presidential candidacy in March, made the comments in an interview with the Fox News host Neil Cavuto. Mr. Cavuto asked if Mr. Cruz had to win one of the first three states â Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina â to be viable.  “If you look historically since World War II, no one has ever won the nomination without winning at least one of those first three,” said Mr. Cruz, who was a policy adviser on George W. Bush’s first presidential campaign in 2000.  “That has certainly been history. You know, I think it’s an interesting challenge for a number of other of these candidates.”  He continued: “The media describes, for example, Jeb Bush, frequently, as the front-runner. It becomes an interesting question when you ask, which of those states does he win?”  Mr. Cruz added that he would compete “vigorously” in all of those states. He did not directly answer a question about whether he would compete in Florida, home to both Mr. Bush and another contender, Senator Marco Rubio. But he said he was competing nationwide.  The remarks about Mr. Bush come as he is on the cusp of becoming a formal candidate, after months of a sometimes-difficult exploratory phase. Mr. Cruz has raised large sums for the “super PAC” supporting him, but he has been standing in place in most of the polls.
