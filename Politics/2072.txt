A day after Hillary Rodham Clinton said she opposed abolishing the death penalty, Senator Bernie Sanders took to the Senate floor on Thursday and declared that âthe time is now for the United States to end capital punishment.â In seizing an opportunity to appeal to liberals who might be disappointed with Mrs. Clintonâs views, Mr. Sanders asserted that ending the death penalty was âthe right point of view,â arguing that the government âshould itself not be involved in the murder of other Americans.â âI would rather have our country stand side-by-side with European democracies rather than with countries like China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and others who maintain the death penalty,â Mr. Sanders said. He added that âat a time of rampant violence and murder all over the world,â the United States government should âsay loud and clearly that we will not be part of that process.â âI think that those of us who want to set an example — who want to say that we have got to end the murders and the violence that weâre seeing in our country and all over the world â should, in fact, be on the side of those of us who believe that we must end capital punishment in this country,â Mr. Sanders said. Mrs. Clinton weighed in on the death penalty on Wednesday in response to a question from a voter in New Hampshire. Though she said she did not support its abolition, she expressed concern that the death penalty âhas been too frequently applied, and too often in a discriminatory way.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
