Senator Ted Cruz of Texas went to Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, on Thursday afternoon to make some matzo â the unleavened bread central to the Passover holiday later this month. The site: Chabad Neshama Center, which shares a block of Ocean Parkway with a chiropractor, a dentist, a pediatrician and an ophthalmologist named Dr. Mitchell S. Seidman. The center includes a preschool (âfor more info, call Shula,â reads a sign out front) and a âModel Matzah Bakeryâ that serves about 2,000 children, according to an administrator, while teaching them about Passover. âThe experience of the exodus of Egypt is felt in a very real, exciting and educational way,â the centerâs website says. Mr. Cruz arrived around 4:35 p.m., walking upstairs to the bakery, where about a dozen children and several adults from the Hasidic Jewish community waited. The room included a painting of the Egyptian pyramids, a mÃ©lange of wooden blocks on the floor, a collection of fish-themed balloons and two New York City police officers standing guard. Two stations were assembled, labeled âflourâ and âwater,â as an adult kneaded the dough. The children, mostly 3 and 4 years old, wore paper chefâs hats. One of the hosts wore a âDanger: Men Cookingâ apron. âHow do we make matzo?â Leah Winner, the youth program director, asked the youngsters. âWe just get some cheese and some ketchup?â âNOOO,â they replied in unison, and soon a âwater and flour!â chant filled the room. Entering the bakery, Mr. Cruz stopped to pose for a few pictures. The adults led a chant of âroll, roll, roll your matzo,â as the group migrated to the dough table and fetched rollers. Mr. Cruz was asked if this was his first matzo-making outing. âIt is,â he said. Would he like a matzo-making hat? âIâll pass on the hat,â he said. âItâs a basic rule of politics: Be careful with hats.â (He used equivalent logic in declining to wear a cheesehead in Wisconsin on Monday.) Would he like dark or light matzo? âAhhhhh, surprise me.â An administrator asked if the children were excited to see Mr. Cruz. There was mostly silence â and an intense focus on rolling. âYou guys are doing a great job,â Mr. Cruz said. Mr. Cruz was asked if he would like to have holes in his matzo. âI would like to have holes in my matzo,â he said. Then came another chant: âMake, make, make the holes.â Mr. Cruz, in a light blue tie and cowboy boots, lowered his head a bit, joining the children around the table. âSo how old is everybody?â he asked. âThree!â âThree!â âOver three!â  âEveryoneâs three!â Mr. Cruz said. A child chimed in to correct him.  Youâre four?â Mr. Cruz asked. âYouâre four. Three and four. Youâre four? Youâre five?â One child said he was 13, unconvincingly. With ages established, Mr. Cruz asked the children to name their favorite thing about Passover. âMaror!â a boy replied, naming the bitter herbs eaten at a Seder. âYou are going to have an interesting life,â Mr. Cruz said, to the laughter of adults. âYou are attracted to the more difficult things in life.â  âThank you,â a man nearby told him. âThis is my son.â  “This is a young man who doesnât shy away from a challenge,â Mr. Cruz said. The father surmised that his son could run for president one day. Mr. Cruz did not reply; it was not clear that he heard. As the girl to his left worked the dough, Mr. Cruz observed that the piece had many holes. âThat is a lot of holes,â Mr. Cruz said. âItâs hole-y matzo. There we go!â The joke killed in this room. Mr. Cruz went on to say he had been âprivileged to be at many a Seder table,â recalling an encounter last year with a Holocaust survivor. Someone remarked on the fish balloons. âThatâs fabulous,â Mr. Cruz said. âYouâve got fish, like, flying in the air.â Then Mr. Cruz grabbed a pizza-peel-style utensil and lifted the dough toward an oven in the corner of the room. He asked about the differences between this oven and a pizza oven, and began discussing Passover with some of his hosts. âNext year in Jerusalem,â Mr. Cruz said at one point, uttering the phrase that comes at the conclusion of a Seder.  He was told that, because Passover had not yet come, the appropriate phrase would be âthis year in Jerusalemâ at this stage. âWell, next year in Jerusalem,” he said, “hopefully Iâll need a bigger plane to get there.” Mr. Cruz was asked if he consulted often with any particular rabbi or other counselor on the Jewish faith. “Nick!â he said, calling over an aide, Nick Muzin, who he said advised him often on the subject. A short while later, the matzo was ready, and the attendees gathered for a picture. âWhat camera are we looking at?â Mr. Cruz asked. This never became entirely clear. But soon, a tune broke out: âDayenu,â a Passover song that translates to âit would have been enough.â Day-day-enu, day-day-enu, day-day-enu, dayenu, dayenu! Mr. Cruz joined in, a bit uneasily, for a few syllables at a time. “Many blessings, and thank you,â Mr. Cruz said, as an aide signaled it was time to leave. Removing her chefâs hat, Ms. Winner said it had been âvery importantâ for a presidential candidate like Mr. Cruz to have taken in the scene. She was asked if he seemed familiar with Jewish traditions. âSomewhat,â she said. âIâm not going to lie. Somewhat.â As Mr. Cruz reached the door, flanked by a phalanx of staff members and photographers, another host was less equivocal. âDefinitely good for the Jews!â he shouted, and the senator stepped out again onto Ocean Parkway.
