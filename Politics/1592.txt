Donald J. Trump and former Gov. Jeb Bush have been deadlocked in recent polls and sniping between the two Republican presidential candidates is getting increasingly personal. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that the former Florida governor lacks energy and will not deliver on his promises because he is beholden to the big donors who are filling his campaign war chest. “Somebody thatâs reliant on all of these lobbyists and special interests and donors, they have no power,” Mr. Trump said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”  He added, “The $100 million that he raised is a bad thing, not a good thing.” Mr. Bush is leading the crowded Republican field in fund-raising so far, and Mr. Trump, a billionaire businessman, argues that his personal wealth empowers him as a candidate. He also said that he will file the required personal financial disclosure forms on Wednesday or Thursday.  “Every single person is expecting something for that money and thatâs not good for the country,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Bush. “That means you can’t make deals that are good for the country.” Mr. Bush has taken issue with Mr. Trump’s comments in recent weeks, particularly his remarks that undocumented immigrants from Mexico are criminals and “rapists.” Mr. Bush also took offense to Mr. Trump’s suggestion that he has an affinity for Mexicans because his wife is Mexican-American. “A Republican will never win by striking fear in peopleâs hearts,” Mr. Bush said in Iowa on Tuesday, suggesting that his rival was preying on people’s angst. Mr. Trump continues to stand by his remarks, but said that they have been distorted and blown out of proportion. He vowed again on Wednesday that he will win the Hispanic vote because he employs thousands of them and knows how to create jobs. “The Hispanics love me,” he said.
