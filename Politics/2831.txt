Eight groups hoping to press Hillary Rodham Clinton to address Wall Street excesses released a letter on Wednesday urging her to focus on the issue of “golden parachute” compensation packages for Wall Street executives who go on to take government jobs. The issue is one that has been pushed by Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who Democracy for America and MoveOn.org want to run for president. The progressive groups have become more vocal as the presidential nominating contest has gone on, and they are seeking to push Mrs. Clinton to the left to combat what they call Wall Street’s excesses, in this case financial executives who take government jobs, where they can use their power to benefit the private sector. âAmericans are sick and tired of the Wall-Street-to-Washington revolving door, and are looking for a presidential candidate who will take concrete steps to fight it,â said Kurt Walters, said campaign manager of Rootstrikers, one of the groups that signed the letter. âSecretary Clinton hasnât yet shown that she is that candidate, but we hope her responses to these questions will demonstrate she shares these progressive priorities.â A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton declined to comment.
