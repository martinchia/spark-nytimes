As Congress reconvenes on Monday after the Thanksgiving break, it will head right into its annual end-of-year rituals, including spending fights and senatorial Secret Santas.  One tradition beloved by government waste-watchers was former Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahomaâs annual tome detailing 100 federal projects he viewed as wasteful: duplicative programs, expensive gadgets owned by the Department of Defense and, everyoneâs favorite, seemingly oddball scientific studies or programs, like teaching mountain lions to walk on treadmills. They all got Mr. Coburn, a Republican, riled, to the tune of millions of dollars.  The report has been given a new twist by Senator James Lankford, who was elected in 2014 to finish Mr. Coburnâs truncated term. Mr. Lankfordâs report, which will be released publicly on Monday afternoon, puts what he views as needless spending and regulations into one book, structured like a report on the National Football League. Here’s one example. Conference: Spending. Team: National Endowment for the Arts. Fumble: $95,700 to help fund a program that produces silent adaptations of Shakespeare in a Washington, D.C., theater.  Mr. Lankford also frowns on a National Science Foundation taxpayer expenditure of $374,087 to study senior adultsâ dating habits. âUnless this federal match.com for seniors develops policy solutions to bring down the debt,â Mr. Lankford writes, âmaybe this one is better left to the private sector.â Mr. Lankford joins other Republican senators, including John McCain and Jeff Flake, both of Arizona, who have made the denouncing of federal pork projects a central focus of their careers.
