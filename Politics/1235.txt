CHILMARK, Mass. â  President Obamaâs musical tastes run from boomer to BeyoncÃ©, with a streak of jazz and a nod to Sinatra. That at least is what he released Friday in his first-ever Spotify playlists, sharing a 20-song âdaytimeâ list and another 20-song âeveningâ one. A White House blog post said the lists were âhand-createdâ by Mr. Obama. If the lists are a guide to how the president rocks out, his days are spent mostly in the 1950s and â60s, with songs like Bob Dylanâs âTombstone Blues,â Stevie Wonderâs âAnother Star,â the Isley Brothersâ âLive It Upâ and âRock Steadyâ by Aretha Franklin. The Rolling Stones are represented with âGimme Shelter,â and Bob Marleyâs âSo Much Trouble in the Worldâ is a perfect title for a commander in chief. And âAinât Too Proud to Beg,â by the Temptations, is an interesting choice for a president who faces an uphill battle in Congress persuading members of his own party to approve his nuclear deal with Iran. There are a few more recent hits on the daytime playlist: âParadise,â by Coldplay, and âShake It Out,â by Florence and the Machine. But unlike Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose recent Spotify list was filled with current pop hits, Mr. Obama has no Katy Perry or Kelly Clarkson or Ariana Grande. Mr. Obamaâs evening list continues the pattern, with Al Greenâs âHow Can You Mend a Broken Heart?â and selections from Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Miles Davis and Billie Holiday. But the presidentâs playlist also includes a BeyoncÃ© song, âSuperpower,â and one called âStubborn Love,â by the Denver-based folk-rock group the Lumineers. Heâs also got Nina Simoneâs âFeeling Good,â which might be a reflection of the last two months of his presidency, which have featured a series of foreign policy achievements, falling unemployment rates and rising approval numbers in the polls. âDue to popular request, here are my vacation playlists,â Mr. Obama said on Twitter, adding, âWhatâs your favorite summer song?â The response on Twitter has been mostly positive. VentureBeat, a technology website, called the lists âBarack Obamaâs âcool dadâ summer jams.â A journalist in Florida said Mr. Obamaâs songs were âpretty groovy.â One person wrote, in all capital letters: âOMG. Obama has Superpower on his Spotify playlist.â The initial reaction is far more positive than the response to Mrs. Clintonâs list, which her presidential campaign released earlier this summer. In an interview on MSNBC, Alan Light, a music critic for Rolling Stone magazine, panned Mrs. Clintonâs list as âpoll testedâ and a gimmick. âIt doesnât feel real,â Mr. Light said of the playlist, which included campaign-friendly songs like âThe Fighterâ and âBelieverâ and âHappyâ â all of which were released after Mrs. Clinton reached her 50s. âIt doesnât feel like anything Hillary Clinton actually listens to.â A version of this article appears in print on 08/15/2015, on page A14 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Presidential Tunes, Day and Night.
