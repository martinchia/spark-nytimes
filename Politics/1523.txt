MINNEAPOLIS â They werenât exactly beating down the door shouting âRun, Joe, run!â Only about 15 members of the Democratic National Committee â out of hundreds gathered here on Thursday for a party conclave â showed up for a noon briefing with advisers of Draft Biden, an independent group encouraging a presidential run by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. A briefing at 3 p.m. drew more than 25 Democrats. Yet if the numbers were modest, the enthusiasm of those assembled was anything but. âBidenâs great, terrific, and he would fill a slot thatâs currently missing among our candidates,â said Larry Taylor, a Democratic committeeman from Oregon, after the first briefing. âHillary Clinton has strong experience, but sheâs just missing the ability to connect with people that Elizabeth Warren has,â he added, referring to the liberal senator from Massachusetts. âI think Biden can connect, while also bringing experience and knowledge and stature.â After the briefings, which were closed to reporters, participants said they asked when the vice president would announce his plans (the Draft Biden representatives had no inside information, but Mr. Bidenâs decision is expected in the next month) and about his priorities (fighting for the middle class and championing universal health care were among those mentioned). âI liked everything I heard,â said Jake Quinn, a committeeman from North Carolina. âIâd like to see Joe Biden in the race â his poll numbers definitely look good,â he added, referring to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday that showed him rivaling, if not topping, Mrs. Clintonâs strength against potential Republican candidates in 2016. Several Democrats said they were struck most by the groupâs advisers’ saying that Mr. Biden would âcontinue to push the progressive policies of President Obama more than any other Democrat,â as Patricia Frost-Brooks, a committeewoman from Ohio, put it. âIt was very clear that Biden would run as President Obamaâs partner and ally and seek to build on his record,â said Ms. Frost-Brooks, who described herself as a strong supporter of the president. Josh Alcorn, who led the briefings as senior adviser to Draft Biden, confirmed that he told the Democrats that, in essence, if they love President Obama, they would love a President Biden. âI think Vice President Bidenâs been the last guy in the room on so many major decisions that the president has made, and thereâs this connection and bond that they have,â Mr. Alcorn said. âSo if someone can push forward on the Obama agenda, on the Obama-Biden policy framework, itâs the vice president.â More than Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obamaâs former secretary of state? Mr. Alcorn replied that he believed that other Democratic candidates would not factor into Mr. Biden’s ultimate decision, adding, âThe vice president is uniquely positioned to continue and build on the Obama record.â As for the relatively small turnout at the briefings, Mr. Alcorn said he had no expectations about how many would show up. âI was enthused by the turnout, and weâll see how our two sessions go on Friday, and as we walk around the meeting hallways,â Mr. Alcorn said.
