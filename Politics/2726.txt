DES MOINES — It was no accident that Bernie Sanders campaigned in a high school here this morning. His campaign, which enjoys deep support among young people, is trying hard to get more and more, and young and younger, Iowans to the polls. It has created a website, provethemwrongandcaucus.com, that challenges disaffected young people to vote, and has sent campaign literature to high school seniors who will be 18 by the general election, and thus qualified to caucus. At one recent event, he gave a private pep talk to high school students. But the campaign is also advertising the caucuses with lightning-fast videos on the social media apps where young people spend so much of their time. Narrated by Reg E. Cathey, an actor on “House of Cards,” they feature chickens and robot hands, mooing cows and snowballs hitting people in the face, and a pointing Uncle Sam telling young people to âtake your folks with you, got it?â  The five-second ads are irreverent, fast and entirely in the vernacular (so we hear) of the millennial voters Mr. Sanders hopes will turn out for him in droves.
