Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey announced his campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nominationÂ on Tuesday with a speech at his old high school in Livingston, N.J. Over instant messages, two New York Times political correspondents analyzed Mr. Christieâs remarks in real time, as they did with the campaign announcements ofÂ severalÂ otherÂ 2016Â candidates. Here is an edited version of their chat. Pat: Hi, Maggie! Great to be back with you for Gov. Chris Christieâs announcement. Heâs in his old high school gym in Livingston, N.J., hoping to tap into his past mojo: He was class president there. What does he need to accomplish today? Maggie: Hi, Patrick! Good being here again. I think Christie has fallen so far that he really needs a terrific, home-run speech to remind people that his oratory is what drew them to him in the first place. He canât tout the New Jersey miracle anymore: The record credit downgrades during his tenure wonât allow for it. But I think he can sell a very compelling human narrative, and given that not many of these announcement speeches have been overwhelming, he should be able to clear the bar. And you? Sent at 11:14 AM on Tuesday Pat: He needs to go national with this speech: To get voters to see what America is missing today, what it needs in the future, and why his particular set of leadership and personal skills can deliver on that. Itâs such a huge field of candidates â he has to make a case that voters should give him a fair-minded look. Maggie: I think it will also be important to watch for how aggressively he goes after Hillary Clinton, since electability was once his calling card, but itâs a tougher case to make now. Pat: And here he is! With a microphone in hand, and no teleprompter. He goes quickly to biography — saying how his âconfidenceâ began in Livingston. Interesting that the very first adjective he uses about himself is âconfidence.â Maggie: What is striking watching him is that he is still addressing this race as if he is a frontrunner. Pat: He is an exceptionally bullish politician. If few people believe in you anymore, you have to show them that you believe in yourself to lay the ground for a second look.  Sent at 11:21 AM on Tuesday Pat: Heâs several minutes into a Wikipedia-style recounting of his biography. Positioning himself as a family man and a son of New Jersey, the fulfillment of the American Dream. His narrative and four kids on stage remind me of Marco Rubioâs kickoff. Though much different personal circumstances. Maggie: Yes, he is really pitching personal biography, which I think is aimed as much at Jeb as anything else. Pat: Man of the people, vs. Jebâs privilege and entitlement (at least thatâs how opponents would like to brand Jeb). Maggie: Precisely. Christie certainly would, especially since he is billing himself as someone who can connect. This is not a speech about America yet, however. This is really all about him. And thereâs a fine line between making that kind of a connection and sounding like youâre giving what our colleague, Mark Leibovich, once reported as Christieâs âme-noteâ speech at the GOP convention in 2012. Pat: The 2016 candidates are drawing on a great deal of American heritage â Hillary with her mother, for instance. Maggie: Yes, they are. No question about that. But Clintonâs speech was extensively about voters and the country for the first portion. Sent at 11:26 AM on Tuesday Now heâs moving toward the rest of the country, and New Jersey as a microcosm for what he can do nationally. I just think itâs hard for someone whose negatives are so high in all poll to focus so extensively on himself in a speech that is all about the future. Pat: Heâs running as a leader, for better or worse. Heâs casting himself as a reformer â of tenure, of pension laws, of âa state that is not governableâ in the eyes of cynics. Maggie: Thatâs right. And that was the theme of his re-election too. Itâs interesting, this is very reminiscent of Giuliani. âUngovernableâ was the word he used to describe New York City as well. Pat: âBoth parties have failed our country.â Maggie: âWhen I hear the media say that our country is angry, I know that theyâre wrong.â Heâs arguing that what Americans are is âfilled with anxiety,â a different mood. Pat: Strong leadership is what he is selling. Maggie: Heâs very much casting himself as the anti-Washington candidate too. âYou went there to work for us, not the other way around,â he says. âAnd both parties have failed our country.â Pat: âThis dysfunction, this lack of leadership, has led to an economy thatâs weak, that hasnât recovered the way it should.â That will resonate with plenty of voters â the feeling that the recovery could have been stronger. Maggie: The âbickeringâ line about D.C. was great. But this is a speech very much designed to capitalize on this anxiety he is talking about. As an aside, itâs a sweet visual watching his kids whisper to each other behind him. Pat: They have surely heard this stuff from Dad before! Maggie: Hahaha, yes, they donât look surprised! The thing is, Christie is doing something Clinton and Jeb can never do, which is rail on Washington this way. And at this moment, even amid changing demographics nationally, there is such a resurgent focus on working-class white voters despite their waning political power. Pat: An outsider candidate has real appeal with that demographic. Sent at 11:35 AM on Tuesday Maggie: âAmerica is tired of handwringing and indecisiveness and weakness in the Oval Office.â Which is the comment you might imagine Hillary Clinton giving were President Obama not a Democrat for whom sheâd worked. There is a degree to which this is hard to reconcile, his conversation about entitlement reforms, given the pension-reform mess in New Jersey. And he will be reminded of that in newspapers. Pat: He is painting rosy pictures of New Jersey, for sure. And no talk about bridges! (I wonder if he will ever talk about infrastructure.) Maggie: And this is very much a âPut me in, Coach, Iâm ready to playâ speech. Hahaha on bridges – good point! Pat: He has now pivoted to foreign policy, and the âstrong leaderâ rhetoric is really coming out. He is talking about foreign policy in much greater detail than several other candidates. He sees an opening here: That Americaâs adversaries see no threat from America. That they are not scared of President Obama. Maggie: Thatâs a bit of a risky line about Obama living âin his own world, not our world.â Wow. Thereâs the Clinton attack – Obamaâs âsecond mate.â Pat: And claiming, about other countries, âthere are limits to your conduct, and America will enforce the limits of that conduct.â Maggie: Heâs selling himself as the lone truth-teller in this race. And I suspect it will work for awhile. Pat: His appeal in the televised debates could be huge â if he makes the cut and gets on stage. Maggie: This is one of his best performances in years. He is such a gifted political performer. Pat: Even if the script raises eyebrows, and the baggage is heavy, the performance is one of gusto and self-certainty. Fake it till you make it (in public opinion polls). Maggie: Hahaha. Yes, totally. âItâs only in America where someone like me could have the opportunity to seek the highest office the world has to offer.â He is really selling the story of up-by-the-bootstraps. And with good reason. Sent at 11:43 AM on Tuesday Maggie: That was a weird moment. Heâs talking about children all across the country, and then lists a bunch of New Jersey towns and cities. Pat: Itâs what he knows. Maggie: Thereâs a provincialism that I think he will struggle with throughout. Pat: He canât run away from New Jersey. He IS Jersey. And he believes that authenticity is what people hunger for, and what he can offer (especially compared to Hillary Clinton, who people still feel they donât know). Maggie: I think thatâs right. The authenticity piece was very much on display. And it is, as you say, the enduring complaint about Clinton. Pat: He was himself in this speech. It wasnât about reintroducing himself to America, like Hillaryâs speech. It wasnât about playing up certain aspects of his history, or playing down others, like Jebâs speech. It wasnât aimed at a narrow slice of voters, like Ted Cruz. It was saying, Iâm a strong, tell-it-like-it-is leader who wants to change Washington at a time when we desperately need strong leadership. Maggie: Thatâs right. âTake me as I am.â Pat: So, no surprises. No Chris Christie 2.0. âI am offering myself just the way I am, like it or not, take it or leave it.â Sent at 11:45 AM on Tuesday Maggie: This could have been his 2013 re-election speech. It felt very familiar, all of it. And consistency is something his folks are hoping to sell. Pat: Maggie, one thing that was strikingly absent from the speech â policy (no attacks on Obamacare as other Republicans make) and current social issues like policing and gay marriage. Maggie: Yes, definitely â he can’t touch the social issues and Obamacare is tricky for him because of actions in his own state. It really highlights how much pin-dancing he has to do, in a lot of ways. O.K., thatâs a wrap – weâve almost run out of candidates! Pat: Until next time!
