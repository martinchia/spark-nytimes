With multiple presidential hopefuls indicating that they will not spend money on the Iowa Republican straw poll this summer, the importance of a decadeslong tradition increasingly seems diminished. Concerned about this prospect, a group of Republican activists in Iowa is moving to press candidates into actively participating in the Aug. 8 gathering. County Republican leaders representing over 90 of Iowa’s 99 counties have signed a letter pleading with the presidential prospects to compete in the straw poll, according to an Iowa Republican who shared the document and has been briefed on the strategy.   “The Iowa straw poll is a tradition worth supporting and one grass-roots activists will fight to preserve,” states the letter, which is being circulated by Republican leaders from the state’s two largest counties, Polk and Linn.  “Fortune favors the bold.” Many of the same county leaders are also circulating a petition to other activists, the state party’s governing board and representatives of presidential candidates urging the White House aspirants to compete in the straw poll. “I hope you can take a minute and help us show the grass-roots support for the Iowa straw poll!” wrote the Sioux County Republican Committee, asking recipients to sign a petition at strawpollpetition.com and forward the request to 10 people.  The email was forwarded by an Iowa Republican who received it and said similar messages were being sent out from other county committees.  The website, devised by the Carroll County Republican chairman, features a photograph from the 1999 straw poll — won by George W. Bush, then the governor of Texas — and implores candidates to participate. “Today, our beloved straw poll is under attack from political elites who want the people to have less power in the nomination process,” wrote Craig Williams, the Carroll County party chairman. In his own email to a list of undisclosed recipients — also forwarded by an Iowa Republican — Mr. Williams used even more provocative language that underscored the nervousness party activists feel about the potential decline of the poll’s importance.  “All a candidate really needs this year is 1) a plane ticket to Iowa, 2) a hotel room for the night and 3) the boldness to face 20,000 Iowans,” wrote Mr. Williams, who is also a member of the state party’s governing board. “If they canât do that, how can we expect them to face ISIS?” The last-ditch effort to keep the straw poll relevant comes after a succession of candidates have stated that they would not spend money to bus in, feed and purchase admission tickets for supporters. Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida have said they would not try to win the straw poll, which takes place in Boone, Iowa, this year. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky have said they were not sure yet whether they would spend money on the poll. The straw poll has been a moneymaker for the state party and has served as a test of organizational strength in many races since its inception in 1979.  It has also served a winnowing role, prompting candidates to drop out of the race if they did not meet expectations in Ames, where it had been previously held.  But candidates and their campaigns have also complained about the money they were forced to spend on an event that offered no delegates and that could effectively be bought by those willing to pay to import supporters. And they have a bit of political cover to forgo the event, as Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa has said in recent years that the event has outlived its usefulness. Should top-tier candidates not actively attempt to win, the impact of success or failure at the poll is unlikely to matter as much going into the caucuses.  The state Republican Party has tried to reduce the pay-to-play nature of the gathering, but it is not clear whether it will retain anything close to the relevance it once had: Multiple campaigns did not bother to send representatives to an organizational meeting held by the state party Thursday in Des Moines.
