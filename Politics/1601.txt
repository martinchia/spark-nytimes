Good Thursday morning from Washington, where both the Obama administration and Republicans are charting their next moves on the Iran nuclear deal. But the focus now shifts back to the campaign trail, where the deadline to file financial disclosure forms offered a glimpse into the money coming in and going out of the campaigns. The campaign finance filings of the 2016 presidential candidates, filed until the last minute on Wednesday night, bring into sharper relief the cash available to their campaigns and paint a picture of their spending habits. Hillary Rodham Clinton leads the presidential field in both fund-raising and spending, having raised more than $46 million for the Democratic nominating contest since entering the race in mid-April. She has also spent more than $18 million, for a “burn rate,” or how quickly she is spending her cash on hand, of almost 40 percent. She has also created a campaign infrastructure larger than those of any of her rivals. Her burn rate was higher than anticipated, in part because the campaign is intent on being frugal, an ethos set by her campaign manager, Robby Mook, and largely reflected in salaries and cellphone reimbursements. Yet while staff members are encouraged to take low-cost buses instead of trains, there were roughly $8,700 in Amtrak fees. The spending also included more than $275,000 to Correct the Record, a group supporting Mrs. Clinton and focused on opposition research that also compiled data on her own record going back decades. Her team has spent more than $1 million on polling. Jeb Bush is among the top-raising Republicans. He raised roughly $11.5 million and spent about $3 million. Marco Rubio, the Florida senator who declared his candidacy around the same time as Mrs. Clinton, reported raising nearly $9 million and spending $3 million. He also transferred roughly $3 million from his Senate campaign committee into the presidential account. For the most part, the Republican candidates are using “super PACs” as fail-safes, raising large sums without limitations. Yet some functions can still be performed only by the campaigns, and so-called hard dollars, the campaign committee money that is capped at donations of $2,700 for the primary, tend to be more durable. â Maggie Haberman Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. President Obama will visit El Reno Federal Correctional Institution outside Oklahoma City, the first sitting president to visit a federal prison. He will repeat his calls to overhaul the criminal justice system, talk of a need for more humane conditions, and meet with law enforcement officials and inmates. The Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet L. Yellen, who warned House Republicans on Wednesday not to increase congressional oversight of the central bank, will move to the Senate to testify before the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. And Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will meet with Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to discuss the Iran nuclear deal. With the Obama administration stepping up its lobbying for the Iran pact, Republican campaign strategists say they fervently hope that many Democratic House and Senate candidates are enticed into backing it. The more Republicans assess the potential political consequences for Democrats of supporting the Iran agreement, the more they believe it could play in their favor in the 2016 congressional elections. After successfully capitalizing on national security fears in the closing weeks of the 2014 midterms, Republicans say that if voters see the agreement with Iran as weak, it could help Republicans maintain their advantage on that issue next year. Republicans also say that opposition from Jewish donors and groups worried about the security of Israel could cut significantly into the ability of Democrats to raise money from those traditionally reliable allies. With an unfavorable Senate map headed into 2016, Republicans are looking for an edge, and their early assessment is that the Iran deal could be a factor in crucial states such as Colorado, Illinois, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Democrats think Republicans are getting way ahead of themselves. They argue that voters can be sold on a groundbreaking diplomatic achievement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran and brings stability to the Middle East without armed conflict. But both sides acknowledge there is a way to go before the true political ramifications are known. â Carl Hulse Itâs a rare day lately that Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey doesn’t turn over his duties to his lieutenant governor so he can campaign for president. Even before he began seeking the Republican nomination last month, he had been out of the state for about half the year. Democratic leaders in the State Senate want to make it official; on Monday, they will introduce a bill requiring New Jersey governors to resign if they run for president. The bill has almost no chance of becoming law, given that Mr. Christie himself would have to sign it. But the debate will reinforce the unflattering home-state optics that dog Mr. Christie. Democrats are fund-raising off the bill requiring him to resign. A Monmouth University poll released this month showed that 57 percent of New Jersey voters think he should resign; his approval ratings remain at the lowest of his tenure. The vast majority of voters also want him to reimburse taxpayers for the cost of the state troopers who travel with him, something Mr. Christie has said he has no intention of doing. The governor will show New Jersey a little love on Thursday when he gives a speech in Camden about criminal justice, his first presidential campaign event in his own state. Heâll hold a fund-raiser in Asbury Park next month as well. But it may be too little too late: There are at least two events in New Jersey this month for Jeb Bush, who has raised about $114 million to Mr. Christieâs $11 million. â Kate Zernike Mr. Rubio has missed the most Senate votes among his colleagues who are also running for president, though the clash between congressional duties and a national campaign are hardly new. As he reframes his record to clear the way for Mrs. Clinton‘s White House bid, Bill Clinton said his 1994 crime law jailed too many for too long and helped usher in an era of mass incarceration. And while on a barnstorming trip through South Carolina on no sleep, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin skirted the issues of race and gun control in the city where nine people were killed in the church shooting last month. But he sought to clarify earlier comments about gay Boy Scout leaders. Though the Republicans seeking the presidency have said they would scuttle the Iran deal as soon as they take office, they will find, Paul Waldman at The Washington Post writes, that “this is one more Obama administration achievement” that “a president from their party wonât actually be able to roll back.” And despite his falling support at home, Mr. Christie received the endorsement of Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland on Wednesday. Mr. Bush is bracing for others to pile up on him during the Aug. 6 Republican debate, with Donald J. Trump most likely leading the charge, Politico reports.
