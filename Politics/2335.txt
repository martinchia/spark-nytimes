Most Fridays during the Supreme Court term, the justices gather in a private conference to decide which appeals they will hear. The odds have always been long: About one in 100 requests for review are granted. With Justice Antonin Scaliaâs death, the odds just got longer. It takes four votes to grant a review. But now there are only eight available votes, and simple math suggests that the number of cases on the courtâs docket will drop. But math only starts to tell the story. The justices now have reasons to avoid cases that are likely to end in deadlocks. And the four-member conservative bloc that included Justice Scalia now lacks the unilateral power to add cases to the docket. On Monday morning at 9:30, we will have our first glimpse of this new reality when the court issues orders announcing the results of Fridayâs conference, the first since Justice Scaliaâs death. Many hundreds of petitioners are hoping the court will hear their cases. But that was always a bad bet, and it just got worse.
