Donald J. Trump has made it official. A week after announcing his plans to run for president at a rally in New York, the billionaire businessman sealed the deal by filing signed documents with the Federal Election Commission. Mr. Trump faced a deadline of July 1 to do so. “I am pleased to submit this filing to the Federal Election Commission, formalizing my campaign for president of the United States,” Mr. Trump said Monday in a statement. “I can rebuild the American dream so that it is stronger, bigger and better than ever before.” The Republican candidate’s campaign will be headquartered in New York City. Mr. Trump heads to Baltimore on Tuesday for a Maryland Republican Party dinner before traveling to Iowa on Saturday and New Hampshire next week. Although Mr. Trump boasts wide name recognition, he fails to register in many national polls, and some analysts doubt that he will be able to sustain his campaign beyond the early primary debates.  However, Mr. Trump says that his business record and message supporting a strong military and free markets will carry him to the nomination.
