BATH TOWNSHIP, Mich. â Since he first hit the trail for his presidential campaign-in-waiting, Jeb Bush has repeated this line at event after event: âThere are a whole lot of conservatives, they just donât know it yet.â On Thursday, the former Florida governor hinted at how he might reach those conservatives. At two separate events in Michigan, Mr. Bush urged Republicans to deviate from the traditional events (perhaps like the Lincoln Day Dinner he was speaking at on Friday night), and try something new. At the event Thursday at Eagle Eye Golf Club, he pledged to âcampaign in places where Republicans havenât been seen in a while; going to college campuses, into the barrios across this country, going to talk to African-Americans in churches to talk about school choice.â âWe need to go to the places where the voters are,â he said.   If this sounds familiar to another Republican candidate, Senator Rand Paul, well, itâs because it is. Earlier Thursday, at an event in Lansing, when asked by a reporter his thoughts on the Kentucky senator, Mr. Bush said he admired Mr. Paul and that heâs âgot some really interesting ideas.â âBack to the question of how you go campaign, I think heâs committed to a similar approach of reaching out beyond the core base constituencies of the conservative cause,â Mr. Bush said of Mr. Paul. The simple truth that Mr. Bush was focusing some of his early efforts on a multiday swing through Michigan, an important but not early primary state, was another example of this way of thinking. âMichigan is an important part of the country, it’s important politically,â Mr. Bush said at an earlier event in Lansing. âIf you think about it from an electoral standpoint, I think Republicans need to get back here a lot.â Follow the New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.
