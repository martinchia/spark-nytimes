Hillary Rodham Clinton pleased progressives this week when she came out in opposition against drilling in the Arctic Ocean. Now they want to hear from her on Social Security. Former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland announced a proposal on Friday to expand Social Security, enhancing its benefits while holding the retirement age steady. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has expressed a similar view, leaving the ball in Mrs. Clinton’s court. Mrs. Clinton has yet to weigh in on the issue, and progressive groups that are closely aligned with Senator Elizabeth Warren’s wing of the party have been trying to elevate their relevance by pressuring the Democratic candidate who is leading in most of the polls. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Democracy for America and MoveOn.org all pressed Mrs. Clinton on Friday to join her rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination in promising to protect Social Security, which subsidizes the retirement income of millions of Americans. “Any candidate who wants to secure the Democratic nomination must commit â clearly â to not only defending but expanding the social safety net,” said Nick Berning, a spokesman for MoveOn. Jim Dean, of Democracy for America, also askedÂ Mrs. Clinton to show solidarity on the issue. “With Martin O’Malley and Bernie Sanders proudly campaigning on the popular idea of Social Security expansion, the only question is whether the other major candidate in the 2016 race is going to join them,” he said. But Mr. O’Malley’s plan did face criticism from some groups as being unrealistic.Â The centrist Third Way group panned Mr. O’Malley’s plan as political pandering that does not add up. “Social Security is in crisis and we need solutions to fix it, not deepen the hole we are in,” the group said in a statement.
