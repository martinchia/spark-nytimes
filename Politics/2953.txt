In the buildup toward the second Democratic presidential debate, Martin OâMalley has ramped up his attacks on his two main rivals, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, specifically on the topic of immigration. Mr. OâMalley has been struggling for months to gain ground, and there has been little room for him in the primary. But he believes that his record on immigration-related issues is more established than those of Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton. Mr. OâMalley has been telegraphing the punches he might throw on Saturday evening on the debate stage, such as highlighting Mrs. Clintonâs stumble on the question of driverâs licenses for undocumented immigrants in a debate in October 2007. Mr. OâMalley has a potential second issue to bring up: Last week, in New Hampshire, Mrs. Clinton highlighted her votes as a Senator supporting some version of a border fence.
