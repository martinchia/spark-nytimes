Former Gov. George Pataki of New York has canceled campaign events in New Hampshire to deal with a family health emergency. Mr. Pataki, a Republican, said in a statement that he was pausing his White House bid because his son-in-law, David Levy, had a stroke and was at the intensive care unit at a Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. Mr. Pataki’s campaign said that his daughter Allison and her husband were traveling on Tuesday on a flight to Seattle from Chicago for a vacation ahead of the birth of their first child when Mr. Levy suffered a life-threatening stroke. The plane was diverted to Fargo, N.D., where he was placed in I.C.U. before being transported to Chicago.  “This episode is a shock to us all, as David, only 30 years of age, is a strong young man who enjoyed excellent health,” Mr. Pataki’s campaign said in a statement. ” We are praying for his recovery and welcome everyone’s prayers and good wishes.” A spokesman for Mr. Pataki said that the candidate hopes to return to the campaign trail next week. Mr. Pataki announced last month that he was returning to politics to run for president.
