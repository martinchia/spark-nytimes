Jeb Bush worked the hostâs brother from the stage, pouncing when he learned the man hailed from an early nominating state. He lamented a lack of âfiscal restraintâ during his own siblingâs second term as president. He appraised the merits of the exclamation point in his logo. âIt connotes excitement,â Mr. Bush explained. On his Comedy Central show, Stephen Colbert famously conferred the âColbert bumpâ â a perceptible rise in cachet for the occasional politician who endured an appearance unscathed. On Tuesday evening, as the first political guest of Mr. Colbertâs network television life, Mr. Bush did his best to earn the CBS equivalent. In a largely serious conversation â dictated as much by the newly earnest host as the sober-minded guest â Mr. Bush cast himself as a sensible choice in a chaotic field, repeating calls for âa degree of civilityâ in the race and, at one point, drawing short-lived applause from apparent supporters of President Obama in the crowd. âI donât think Barack Obama has bad motives,â he said, attracting the smattering of cheers. âI just think heâs wrong on a lot of issues.â The ovation stopped and the host tweaked his approach. âYouâve got to pause until they clap,â Mr. Colbert said. âAnd then hit them with what they donât want to hear.â But Mr. Bush, joining the show between an interview with George Clooney and a rollicking musical number, seemed to hold his own. Mr. Colbert was an often accommodating foil. He asked Mr. Bush why he wanted to be president and whether he thought he could bring the country together. And with an earnestness that would have had no place on his old show, Mr. Colbert allowed that there was âa nonzero chance that I would vote for you.â âYou seem like a very reasonable guy who believes that governing is something that the government should do,â he said. After introducing his brother in the crowd, Mr. Colbert asked his guest to talk about his own â specifically, to name a policy difference between them. âI think my brother probably didnât control the Republican Congress’s spending,â Mr. Bush said. âI think he should have brought the hammer down on the Republicans when they were spending way too much because our brand is limited government.â In the âlast three or four years of my brotherâs tenure,â Mr. Bush continued, âhe didnât veto things. He didnât bring order, fiscal restraint.â Mr. Bush noted that his own spending discipline as Florida governor had earned him the nickname âVeto Corleone,â a nod to âThe Godfather.â  âYou know,â Mr. Colbert said, âhe is an antihero in that movie.â  By DAVE ITZKOFF The arch, topical sense of humor that Stephen Colbert cultivated on Comedy Central was much in evidence on the debut of his late-night talk show.
