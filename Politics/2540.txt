While Hillary Rodham Clinton has called for reining in a âdysfunctionalâ campaign finance system, she has nonetheless shown a time-tested ability to attract money from rich and powerful supporters around the country. Her presidential campaign put out a list Wednesday of more than 120 âHillblazers,â supporters from Wall Street to Hollywood who have raised at least $100,000 for her campaign by hosting events. The list features many names familiar in Democratic fund-raising circles. They include close friends of Mrs. Clinton like Susie Tompkins Buell, a San Francisco executive; former aides like Lisa Caputo, now at Citigroup, and Steven Elmendorf, a Washington lobbyist; backers of her failed 2008 campaign like Evan Bayh, the former Indiana governor and senator; and go-to Democratic fund-raisers like the Comcast executive David Cohen, the Chicago investor Fred Eychaner, and Haim Saban, a media investor.  But some big Democratic financiers are missing. Perhaps most surprising is the absence of Jeffrey Katzenberg, the Hollywood entertainment mogul, who has been one of the Democratsâ biggest fund-raisers in recent elections. Mrs. Clinton turned down financial help from some other prominent names, however. A report her campaign filed on Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission said she returned two contributions last month totaling $5,400 from Larry Flynt of Beverly Hills, the publisher of Hustler magazine.
