Good Friday morning. Even on vacation, President Obama seeks to reassure on-the-fence supporters of the Iran nuclear deal that he will take a hard line in enforcing it. And as Donald J. Trump continues to drive both the polls and the news cycles, the ripples extend to his rivals’ camps as they can no longer base their response on simply waiting for him to go away. As the dust from the first Republican presidential primary debate has settled, one fact has become as glaringly bright and clear as a golden hotel sign: Mr. Trump is not going away. With the issue of illegal immigration as his energy source, Mr. Trump has not only survived any fallout from the Fox News debate, he has thrived. So Republicans are increasingly forced to find ways to respond, either by acting more like him (such as Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas), or by acknowledging his power but respectfully disagreeing, like Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio. Then there’s Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor who has seen his poll numbers fall since the debate, and who in the last two days has tried challenging Mr. Trump head-on. But that was after Mr. Trump stuck a rhetorical knife into Mr. Bush’s craw, describing him as “low energy” in New Hampshire. Mr. Trump’s emphasis on immigration also took a violent turn in the last two days, as two men were charged in an attack on a homeless Hispanic man in Boston. One of the accused is reported to have cited Mr. Trump’s views as an inspiration. Mr. Trump responded by calling his supporters “passionate,” but he did not denounce the act. Where Mr. Trump has a potential vulnerability is with social conservatives, and Mr. Bush has tried to remind people of Mr. Trump’s past as an abortion rights-supporting Democrat. But such arguments, or any others, have so far been unable to slow Mr. Trumpâs mummylike creep forward. â Maggie Haberman Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. Americans for Prosperity, which bills itself as “America’s largest center-right grass-roots organization” in pursuit of “lower taxes, less government, and an end to Obamacare,” is hosting its ninth annual, “Defending the American dream” meeting this weekend. On Friday, Mr. Bush and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana will speak, while on Saturday, Mr. Cruz, Rick Perry and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will have their say. Mr. Trump will be in Mobile, Ala., where his venue was changed to a 50,000-seat college football stadium because the demand for tickets eclipsed the previous site’s 1,950 seats. Mr. Cruz‘s campaign team likes to talk about the Republican base as fitting into four tournament-style brackets: establishment/moderates, libertarian, Tea Party and evangelicals. While he has never tried to woo establishment voters, Mr. Trump, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and others have cut into his support among libertarian and Tea Party voters. But among evangelicals, Mr. Cruz has found a solid base, and he has made appeals to that bracket a core element of his campaign, evident in Friday nightâs âRally for Religious Libertyâ in Des Moines. The rally, for which the campaign has received over 2,500 R.S.V.P.s as of Wednesday, materialized in the wake of the Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage, as the campaign read news reports of business owners struggling with the decision â hence the eventâs billing of âcalling attention to the religious persecution of Christian business owners and employees.â Steve Deace, the conservative radio host in Iowa who announced his endorsement of Mr. Cruz on Wednesday, will play M.C., and two well-known Christian music groups will perform: Newsboys â of which Mr. Cruz counts himself a fan â and the Bontrager Family Singers of Kalona, Iowa. The Cruz campaignâs recent extended swing through the Southeast featured stops in churches and a retooled stump speech heavy with messages geared toward the faith community: calls to investigate Planned Parenthood, and, unsurprisingly, calls to âprotect religious liberty.â â Nick Corasaniti  Most congressional Democrats who have decided their stance on the nuclear accord with Iran â whether for it or against â have boasted about their contacts with the White House, from Mr. Obama on down. Not Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who threw her weight behind the nuclear deal on Thursday. “The only call I got from the administration was from Susan Rice,” Ms. McCaskill said in an interview, referring to the president’s national security adviser. “And I told her to leave me alone.” Some people like to be courted. Next Friday, via live webcast, Mr. Obama is going to court the Board of the Jewish Federations of North America and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, part of his effort to garner support for the deal. “I did have a long talk with some very senior administration officials, and I mean, very senior, in which I laid out a menu of concerns,” said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, who later in the interview let on it had been Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. But Ms. McCaskill said she wanted to do her research on her own. In particular, she called representatives from each of the six countries that negotiated the deal, as well as the countries that actually hold Iran’s frozen assets. Her conclusion: “The more calls I made the more it became clear to me the new status quo if we reject the deal would be A) a much diminished United States in terms of its ability to influence international policy,” she said. “The B) was, it’s not clear to me theyâre not going to get the money anyway.” â Jonathan Weisman and Michael D. Shear Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has drawn big crowds to his “Political Revolution,” speaking to an angry vision of a broken system that requires fundamental change. Martin OâMalley, the former Maryland governor, unveiled a plan to expand Social Security, rejecting calls to raise the retirement age for the program, and, like Mr. Sanders, seeking an increase in benefits. And in a Quinnipiac University survey of voters in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, Mr. Rubio beat Hillary Rodham Clinton in a general election matchup by the widest margins of any Republican presidential candidate. Former President Jimmy Carter disclosed the extent of his cancer diagnosis on Thursday and said he was at peace with whatever happens given his “exciting and adventurous, gratifying existence.” But he did express some regrets, and one was particularly striking. “I wish I had sent one more helicopter to get the hostages, and we would have rescued them, and I would have been re-elected,” Mr. Carter said. He was referring to the failed 1980 Iran hostage rescue mission that ended in disaster in the desert when a helicopter crashed into a transport plane, a debacle often cited as contributing to Mr. Carter’s loss to Ronald Reagan. Besides raising the question of what the world would look like had there been no two-term Reagan presidency, his answer showed that the episode has clearly haunted him through a post-presidency generally considered very successful. The episode has also influenced military and rescue strategy. The specter of the Carter-era hostage failure was cited by several Obama administration officials as the reason Mr. Obama pushed for extra helicopters during the 2011 raid on the Osama bin Laden compound. And they were needed; one crashed while trying to land. â Carl Hulse The Columbus Dispatch in Ohio takes Mr. Rubio to task for saying, in a speech in Detroit on Thursday, that the Wright Brothers were from Kitty Hawk, N.C., where they made their historic flight in 1903. But they were from Dayton, Ohio. “Ooops,” Jack Torry writes in the paper, adding, “Getting things wrong about the Wright Brothers is a real sore point in Dayton, which likes to call itself the birthplace of aviation.” CBS News looks at how the Black Lives Matter movement is affecting the campaign in both parties.  CNN investigates the important role that Mr. Cruz‘s wife plays on the fund-raising front.  Mr. Paul turns to Bloomberg View to write an op-ed about why he wants more audits of the Federal Reserve. Presidential debates are meant to be serious affairs, but a movement is growing to add some levity to the mix by recruiting Jon Stewart, the recently retired “Daily Show” host, to take a turn as moderator. Nearly 100,000 people have signed an online petition urging the Commission on Presidential Debates to consider Mr. Stewart for one of the three final debates ahead of the 2016 election. Citing his Peabody Award and his experience interviewing world leaders, the petition suggests, âChoosing Jon Stewart would be a popular choice among voters.â Mr. Stewartâs presence in front of the debate stage would be a boon for ratings, but his left-leaning reputation could potentially irk a Republican presidential candidate. If Mr. Trump makes it that far it would be his first time facing off with Mr. Stewart, who called the billionaire a gift from the comedy gods before he signed off from the show. In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Mr. Trump said that he had enjoyed overshadowing Mr. Stewartâs valedictory broadcast in the ratings with this debate performance on Fox, which drew record viewership. While he claimed to have âno problemâ with Mr. Stewart, he did profess a preference for Bill Maher. â Alan Rappeport Like the Politics Newsletter? Get it delivered to your inbox.
