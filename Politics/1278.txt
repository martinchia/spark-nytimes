Good Monday morning. The Republican presidential candidates prepare to take the stage for their second debate with a new face in the prime-time lineup, and withÂ Donald J. TrumpÂ holding his place at center stage. On Wednesday night, flanked by 10 other Republican presidential candidates,Â Mr. TrumpÂ will show whether he can deliver a repeat performance at a debate. Despite all assumptions about the laws of political gravity, Mr. Trump not only survived a contretemps over his criticisms of a moderator,Â Megyn KellyÂ of Fox News, at the first debate, but managed to thrive, doubling his support in some polls since. Just as last time,Â Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, will be to Mr. Trump’s left on the stage. Mr. Bush is the rival whom Mr. Trump most loves to kick, and it has visibly gotten under Mr. Bush’s skin. To Mr. Trump’s right will beÂ Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who has become a recent target of the reality television star as he has risen in the polls, in part on the success of his performance at the first debate. Mr. Trump has used the same basic insult against Mr. Carson that he has against Mr. Bush â that he’s lacking in energy. But Mr. Carson’s response has been fairly self-assured, potentially forecasting a bit of a change in the dynamic for Mr. Trump, who has almost always succeeded in getting the last word with his opponents. Mr. Trump will have another frequent jousting opponent on stage inÂ Carly Fiorina, the lone woman in the Republican race. And two of the aides who helped prepare Mr. Trump for the first debate,Â Sam NunbergÂ and Roger J. Stone Jr., are no longer with his team. â Maggie Haberman What We’re Watching This Week â Â Hillary Rodham Clinton will visit two college campuses in Iowa on Monday âtoÂ talk about key issues facing young women,â her campaign says. â Elsewhere on the trail, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin will hold a town-hall-style event in Nevada, and Martin OâMalley will discuss gun control at a round table in New York City. â Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mrs. Clinton will appear on late-night talk shows this week, Mr. Sanders on âThe Late Show with Stephen Colbertâ on Friday, and, as the Republicans debate on Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton on âThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.â Our Favorites From The Times By MICHAEL BARBARO In rigorous practice sessions for Wednesdayâs Republican debate, Mr. Bush has been preparing pointed responses to Mr. Trumpâs most frequent insults. By AMY CHOZICK The summer of Hillary Rodham Clintonâs discontent continued on the Sunday talk shows, as the political class continued to chew on the challenges facing her candidacy. Ben Carson defended himself against claims by Donald J. Trump, and Senator Bernie Sanders discussed foreign policy. By ERIC LICHTBLAU and TRIP GABRIEL A soft-spoken Republican candidate who apparently had stage fright in the first debate is gaining confidence and wealthier donors. What We’re Reading Elsewhere â Â Writing in the Daily News, Joyce Purnick, a former Times reporter, compares Mr. Trumpâs central campaign theme that he would be immune from outside influence because of his vast wealth, with similar claims from another billionaire turned candidate, Michael R. Bloomberg. â Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, The Washington Post writes, is making outreach to women a key, if surprising, part of his strategy. â Â And Politico writes that with a win among women in an Iowa straw poll, Mrs. Fiorina has found âher fans.â
