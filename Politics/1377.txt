WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. âÂ Jeb Bush, the man who once promised to run for president joyfully, on Monday added a new social media twist to his campaign âÂ Jeb Bush 2.0 will even take selfies joyfully. Asked at a luncheon here how the selfie has changed modern campaigning, Mr. Bush offered a dry retort. âThe selfie is now the 11th amendment of the Bill of Rights,â he said. âItâs inspired by our framers and founders, apparently. It is a requirement that you take one, and I do it with great joy in my heart.â But Mr. Bush, who had spent his early Monday at a restaurant in Hialeah mobbed by eager selfie-takers âÂ before being mobbed by the Miami press corps, who at one point he admonished by saying, âNo violenceâ âÂ wasnât done just yet. âLook, it wasnât that long ago that people wanted signatures on things, and now, forget that,â he said, before mimicking modern voters: âI want my damn selfie. Iâm not leaving until I get it.â He said he hoped that voters had âa long enough armâ â âOr I will take over.â And he added some thoughts on selfie etiquette. âJust for the record, young people do it better than older people,â Mr. Bush said, before using his outstretched right arm to demonstrate proper selfie technique. âItâs cooler to do it diagonally rather than straight up, remember that, and itâs better to do it higher than lower, because you look skinnier.â And after the event, Mr. Bush gamely posed for more selfies, of course.
