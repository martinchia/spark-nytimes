Good Thursday morning from Washington, where President Obama has a long-sought trade deal waiting to be signed and to where Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana has officially declared that he wants to move. But Mr. Obama’s focus now is on a landmark church in Charleston, S.C., and on the eulogy he has to give on Friday for a friend who was shot and killed along with eight others. On Friday, Mr. Obama will once again serve as consoler-in-chief after an unthinkable act â this time the killing of nine African-Americans during a Bible study at a South Carolina church. Mr. Obama has repeatedly been called upon to channel anger and sadness after tragedy. He did it in Arizona, when a gunman shot a member of Congress and many others at a shopping center. He did it in Connecticut after 20 elementary school students and seven adults were killed in Newtown. And he did it after three people were killed in the Boston Marathon bombings. But even as the president and his speechwriter were in “the early stages” of writing the eulogy for the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, aides said it was unclear whether he would also use the opportunity to again address new calls for gun control and the debate about the Confederate battle flag. “The focal point of the president’s remarks will be to pay tribute to Reverend Pinckney and the eight others whose lives were lost in that terrible attack,” said Josh Earnest, the president’s press secretary. That leaves open the possibility that Mr. Obama will once again lament the lack of stronger gun measures, though he has made it clear he believes that Congress is unlikely to agree unless public pressure shifts drastically. And while the Confederate flag is in the political spotlight, Mr. Obama may view the funeral as an inappropriate moment to weigh in on a divisive social issue. Still, Mr. Obama has surprised in the past. His remarks at the memorial service for the children in Newtown were billed by aides as springing merely from an emotional moment. Instead, he issued a demand for Congress to enact sweeping gun laws. Michael D. Shear Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. While the campaign trail runs primarily through the early voting states on Thursday, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will hold a news conference in Washington on overhauling the estate tax. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who came in fourth in a New Hampshire poll this week, will be in the state for events, including two town-hall-style meetings. And Mike Huckabee, Ben Carson and Rick Santorum, all Republicans, will each hold several events in Iowa. Democrats bowed to the inevitable and lent their support to the worker assistance package that is expected to pass the House on Thursday as the battle over fast-track trade power for Mr. Obama draws to a close. After considering one last stand against the trade measure by opposing aid for workers displaced by foreign competition, Democrats concluded that it made no sense for them to reject millions of dollars in assistance for the very people they said they were trying to protect. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader who initially fought the assistance, said that approving it would allow the trade focus to shift to the specifics of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the closely held trade agreement being negotiated between the United States and 11 other countries, including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and Vietnam. Ms. Pelosi said that Democrats intended to âshine a bright lightâ on details of the deal and that they hoped the administration followed through on pledges to strike an agreement Democrats could support. But approval of fast-track power significantly reduces the leverage of trade opponents. Fast-track legislation needed backing from Democrats in the Senate to overcome a filibuster and in the House because some Republicans didnât trust the administration to negotiate an acceptable deal. Under the rules Congress just approved, the Trans-Pacific Partnership can pass the House and Senate on simple majorities, meaning that, in theory at least, not a single Democratic vote would be required in either chamber. â Carl Hulse Mr. Jindal declared his candidacy for president on Wednesday and made his initial announcement via a hidden camera. Here is a look at his stand on some central issues and what his path to victory might be. Jim Webb, the former senator from Virginia and a Democrat considering a run of his own, was criticized on Wednesday for writing on Facebook that the Confederate flag issue should be framed in the larger complexity of the Civil War.While the flag had been used as a symbol of racism in recent decades, he said, that was not always the case.âWe should also remember that honorable Americans fought on both sides in the Civil War, including slave holders in the Union Army from states such as Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland and Delaware, and that many nonslave holders fought for the South,â Mr. Webb wrote. Speaking at an African-American church in Missouri on Tuesday, Hillary Rodham Clinton said that “all lives matter,” offending some on Twitter and in the crowd. They felt she was missing the point of the mantra “black lives matter,” which was used across the country in protests over the police-involved deaths of unarmed black men. Mr. Sanders has not had the same success, or seeming effort, as Mrs. Clinton has had in introducing himself to black voters, representing a test of his campaign’s relevancy even as he draws large crowds. Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, though he has yet to formally declare his candidacy, hopscotched across Iowa, and with some blunt talk, seemed to make new friends. And in an open letter to Mr. Obama, former advisers have warned that the nuclear deal with Iran âmay fall short of meeting the administrationâs own standard of a âgoodâ agreement.” Congresswomen joined in a bipartisan effort on Wednesday night to eke out a 1-0 victory over the Washington press corps at a charity softball game. A rare pitchers’ duel under an even rarer cloudless sky in the capital, the game took just an hour and tied the series between the two sides, 3-3. Jill Agostino of The New York Times pitched a scoreless game until the bottom of the fifth inning, when Representative Cheri Bustos, Democrat of Illinois, hit a line drive into center that was misplayed, allowing her to advance to third. Two batters later, Representative Kristi Noem, Republican of South Dakota, drove in Ms. Bustos to give the congresswomen the only run they would need. Representative Kathy Castor, a Democrat of Florida who made two important stops in the field, was named her team’s most valuable player. In a postgame interview, Ms. Castor told First Draft that her team’s 7 a.m. practices had instilled a crucial piece of advice: “Keep your eyes open when you go to catch the ball.” She said she would keep the M.V.P. trophy in her House office. The game raised $195,000 for the Young Survival Coalition, a group that supports women with breast cancer. “We are a very competitive bunch, so winning is a big deal,” said Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida and one of the Members’ captains. “But at the end of the day, we all win because we raise a bunch of money for breast cancer.” — Nicholas Fandos If the Supreme Court rules against the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act, as many Republicans hope, it could still “create a quandary” for conservative candidates, Reuters writes. Mr. Obama was interrupted by a heckler during a speech at the White House about same-sex marriage. He had the heckler escorted out and told the crowd he was fine with a few hecklers, but not when it was a guest at his house who was “eating the hors d’oeuvres” and “drinking the booze.” And Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin signed bills eliminating 48-hour waiting periods to buy handguns, and to allow off-duty and retired police officers to carry guns in schools. Mr. Jindal has a great rÃ©sumÃ©, but he may have missed his moment in announcing for president, Politico reports. At least he’s not the “REO Speedwagon of politics,” like Sarah Palin.
