Senator Ted Cruz’s standing in many national polls may be middling, but Friday brought fresh evidence as to why he should not be underestimated: The Texas Republican is a magnet for big donors. How big? Toby Neugebauer, an energy investor, donated $10 million to Keep the Promise II, a “super PAC” supporting Mr. Cruz. The donation represents one of the largest amounts given by a single donor to a Super PAC so far this campaign cycle and demonstrates the potential influence that individuals can have upon a presidential election and with a senior lawmaker. Mr. Neugebauer, the son of Representative Randy Neugebauer, Republican of Texas, is the co-founder of Quantum Energy Partners and has been an active investor in the oil and gas sectors, overseeing billions of dollars of assets. Mr. Cruz is not the only presidential candidate whom Mr. Neugebauer has donated to over the years. According to The Texas Observer, he has been known to fly Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, on his private jet to discuss the energy industry and gas drilling in North Texasâs Barnett Shale formation. Mr. Neugebauer also donated more than $100,000 to Mr. Perry in previous election cycles. These days Mr. Neugebauer is mingling with lawmakers such as Mr. Cruz from afar. In 2014 he moved to Dorado, Puerto Rico, raising questions among some in Texas as to whether he was seeking a more hospitable tax climate. Mr. Neugebauer told Bloomberg News at the time that he had moved to Puerto Rico so his children could learn Spanish and attend a better school. âI wouldnât have moved for the taxes,” he said, “but it is an interesting proposition.” Regardless of Mr. Neugebauer’s intentions, taxÂ havens such as Puerto Rico might be less of a drawÂ in a Cruz administration. The senator has called for abolishing the Internal Revenue Service and instituting a flat tax,Â a proposal that would be profitable for wealthy donors such as Mr.Â Neugebauer.
