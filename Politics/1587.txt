Good Tuesday morning from Washington. The conversation after the shooting in Charleston, S.C., almost immediately turned to the Confederate flag, which the gunman embraced in online postings and which hung at the state’s Capitol. On Monday, Gov. Nikki R. Haley called for it to come down. The Confederate battle flag is poised to fall from South Carolinaâs Capitol, with popular support gathering from Republicans in the state and around the country. And as opposition to the symbol solidifies beyond South Carolina, it is increasingly unlikely that the flag will continue to fly much longer beyond the walls of museums and Civil War battlefields. Acceptance of the Confederate flag has been waning for a while. The flag was featured on two separate occasions in Georgiaâs state flag before ultimately being removed. Last year, California moved to ban sales of merchandise with the flag logo. And last week, the Supreme Court ruled that Texas hadn’t violated the First Amendment when it refused to allow license plates bearing the flag. âIt canât be rubbed out of our history, but it ought to be confined to its historical context,â said James McPherson, a Civil War historian at Princeton University. While Republicans have treaded carefully over the flag issue in the past, many, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said on Monday that it was time to retire a symbol that pains so many Americans. Mississippi, which features the Confederate logo in its state flag, might be next to fall. Thousands of petitioners have come in response to the outrage in South Carolina, but Republican lawmakers in the state have been resistant. Nationally, Democrats seem pleased that the flag might finally be history, but they remain steadfast that furling the flag does not co-opt other pressing issues, like gun violence. âThis is just the beginning of a conversation we as a society need to have about race, bigotry and violence in this country â not the end of one,â said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.

Hillary Rodham Clinton will attend a community meeting at a church in Florissant, Mo., to discuss the Charleston shooting and other issues. Donald J. Trump, who made his campaign official on Monday by filing paperwork with the Federal Election Commission, will hold a campaign event in Baltimore. And the White House will host a climate change and health summit meeting, which will include video remarks from President Obama.  A âsuper PACâ founded by an ally of Mrs. Clinton is planning to invest heavily in efforts to tie Republican candidates to the Koch brothers, oil tycoons whom Democrats have maligned in the last three national elections. Third-party groups have sued the Federal Election Commission to open the debates, which they say are made impossible to enter unless a candidate is a Republican or a Democrat. The Senate is set to take yet another critical trade vote on Tuesday, and it appears likely that pro-trade lawmakers will muster the 60 votes needed to clear the way for approval â again â of special fast-track negotiating power for Mr. Obama. Crucial Democrats such as Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the party’s senior member on the Finance Committee, are expected to support the approval of the trade power without tying it directly to aid for workers who lose their jobs because of new imports. The vote on that element of the trade deal will come later in the week if the initial bill passes. The trade legislation first passed the Senate in late May with a few votes to spare. That cushion means that not all of the 14 Democrats who backed it the last time need to do so again, particularly since the measure could pick up a few Republicans who didn’t vote for it. Plus, those Democrats who earlier backed the trade power, fiercely opposed by progressives and organized labor, are already on record defying those groups. Voting against it this time probably won’t heal those wounds. It has been a long and emotional fight, but it appears to be nearing an end. — Carl Hulse Mrs. Clinton has embraced racial issues head on in her campaign so far, and how they have shaped her approach has emerged as the most striking difference between her 2016 campaign and the failed bid of 2008. Mr. Obama, who has been showing more emotion recently than he is known for, spoke with the comedian Marc Maron on his podcast, noting that racism in the United States is “still part of our DNA.”And the White House announced on Monday that Mr. Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. would attend the funeral on Friday of the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, who was killed in the Charleston shooting. Earl Holt III, the leader of a white supremacist group that is thought to have influenced the suspect in the shooting, donated money to several Republican candidates, who have said they would either return the money or give it to charity. And now the group, which in recent years seemed in decline, has been thrust back onto the national stage and has embroiled the Republican Party in new questions about its ties to the organization. The Washington Post looks inside the efforts of Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin to lay a foundation for his eventual presidential run, saying that his “$20 million push” has included a contrast that “highlights the central challenge Walker faces as he prepares to formally begin his campaign next month: how to expand his aw-shucks, socially conservative Midwestern appeal to the broader Republican Party and to the rest of the country.” A Wall Street Journal and NBC poll suggests that Mrs. Clinton has a “firm grip” on the Democratic nomination. But speaking on Fox News, Lincoln Chafee, the former governor of Rhode Island and one of Mrs. Clinton’s competitors, sought to dispute any notions that she was destined to be the nominee. The Texas secessionist movement has gotten support in, of all places, Russia, where anger still lingers over perceived American support for the breakup of the Soviet Union, Politico reports.
