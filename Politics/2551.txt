Good Thursday morning from Washington, where the Senate is set to discuss Iran, and President Obama is packing for Kenya with plans to do the same. And as Donald J. Trump prepares to speak at an event near the Mexican border, the cameras will be watching. And so will his rivals.  “I wonder what he’s going to say next.” It’s a phrase that is most often used to describe provocative radio hosts like Howard Stern. These days, it is frequently heard with respect to Mr. Trump, the reality television star and Republican presidential hopeful whose caustic comments and surging support in opinion polls have kept the cameras focused on him. Mr. Trump’s latest provocation will most likely come in a trip to the border in Laredo, Tex., on Thursday. According to a schedule released by his campaign, Mr. Trump will “travel to the actual border” and “address the media.” Then he will meet with law enforcement officials at a nearby reception hall. The trip will fall two days after Mr. Trump, on a stage in South Carolina, held up an index card with Senator Lindsey Graham‘s cellphone number on it, an act of political retaliation against a critic that is unheard-of in modern campaigns. Mr. Trump has focused extensively on border security in his campaign speeches, but with inflammatory language that has unnerved the Republican establishment. That issue will certainly be a topic of discussion during Mr. Trump’s trip to Texas â but he has set a high bar for himself in terms of his next act. â Maggie Haberman Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Huckabee will be among the speakers at the American Legislative Exchange Council‘s annual meeting in San Diego, which began on Wednesday and runs through Friday. ALEC is a conservative group with ties to the brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch that has pushed for state pre-emption laws that prevent local governments from enacting certain regulations against businesses. But it has also argued that local governments have the power to write their own rules on a crucial labor issue that has been the prerogative of the states. Martin O’Malley will be in Washington for a discussion on the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law and his own plan for overhauling Wall Street. And Jeb Bush, who outlined a wide-ranging plan on Monday to rein in the size of the federal government and to curb the influence of lobbyists who live off it, will participate in a town-hall-style event in New Hampshire about taking on “Mount Washington,â as he has called it. Secretary of State John Kerry will be back Thursday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he used to preside over, to face Republicans skeptical, if not downright hostile, about the nuclear deal that he negotiated with Iran. Some Democrats might not be all that hospitable to their former colleague either. In the first major hearing on the Iran agreement, Mr. Kerry will appear alongside Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, who was one of his negotiating partners in Vienna, and Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, whose agency enforces economic sanctions on Iran. Mr. Kerry and his fellow cabinet secretaries can be expected to continue making the same case they have presented both in public and in private â that the deal represents major concessions by Iran, is a long-term agreement and contains provisions allowing the quick reinstatement of sanctions if Iran is caught cheating. Republicans will press him on the ability to perform adequate inspections of Iranian nuclear facilities, the risks to Israel and whether the deal puts Iran on the threshold of nuclear weapons ability. The hearing will allow both sides to air their arguments in a public forum after classified briefings. But it is unlikely to change many minds about the deal â Speaker John A. Boehner said on Wednesday that Republicans were “going to do everything possible to stop it.” What it will do is set the stage for August lobbying campaigns by both advocates and opponents of the deal, followed by showdown votes in September. â Carl Hulse Mr. Obama jets off to Africa on Thursday evening, where he will focus on security and on economic and development issues. But he will have a chance to work on another issue during the long flight, namely Iran. Accompanying the president on Air Force One will be more than a dozen members of Congress from both parties and both houses, aides said. He will have plenty of time to bend their ear on the biggest issue coming up on Capitol Hill in the coming weeks. The flight from Washington to Nairobi, Kenya, will take about 17 hours, including a refueling stop in Germany. âThere is a broad cross-section of members that are excited about coming on this trip, and we look forward to hosting them,â said Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser. The White House did not release a list of those participants on Wednesday, but among those reported to be traveling to Kenya and later Ethiopia are Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who is considered an important vote on Iran, and members of the Congressional Black Caucus. Among the Republicans who will be on board is Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona. Although he has opposed the White House on many issues, he has been an ally on the diplomatic opening to Cuba. âIâm pleased to be invited,â he said on Wednesday. Even if it means he will be on the receiving end of a little informal lobbying. — Peter Baker Speaking before hundreds of striking federal contract workers gathered outside the Capitol, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont proposed legislation that would raise the national minimum wage to $15 an hour. A Quinnipiac University survey shows Hillary Rodham Clinton lagging behind Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, and Mr. Walker and Mr. Bush in head-to-head matchups in Iowa, Colorado and Virginia, three swing states. And the list of donors to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey’s presidential campaign includes some high-profile business executives, highlighting Mr. Christie’s efforts to present himself as having the financial wherewithal to compete in the crowded Republican field. A financial disclosure form for Mr. Trump, whose unnerving of the Republican establishment has also eclipsed some of his rivals and caused some tension on conservative radio shows, was made public on Wednesday. It contains wide ranges for asset values and incomes that make it impossible to precisely calculate his net worth or income. Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio hopes his pragmatic, can-do appeal in New Hampshire will help propel him from his low standing in the polls. Republicans on Tuesday attacked Mr. OâMalley for his comments drawing links between climate change and the rise of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, in Syria. While the connection might seem surprising, it is grounded in scientific research. On Monday, Mr. O’Malley discussed the connection between climate change and threats to national security. “One of the things that preceded the failure of the nation state of Syria, and the rise of ISIS, was the effect of climate change and the mega-drought that affected that nation, wiped out farmers, drove people to cities, created a humanitarian crisis that created the symptoms â or rather, the conditions â of extreme poverty that has now led to the rise of ISIS and this extreme violence,â he said. The Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, called Mr. O’Malley’s comments “absurd.” But a study published in March in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences was just the latest in a series of reports highlighting the connection. That study concluded that extreme drought in Syria from 2006 to 2009 was most likely because of climate change, and that the drought was a factor in the violent uprising that began there in 2011. A working group of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change wrote in 2014 that there was âjustifiable common concernâ that climate change increased the risk of armed conflict in certain circumstances, but said it was unclear how strong the effect was. The United States military has described climate change as a âthreat multiplierâ that may lead to greater instability in parts of the world. â Coral Davenport Although accusations of flip-flopping on an issue are a common campaign theme, NBC News writes, “Here’s a dirty little secret in American politics: Almost everyone does it.” They follow their thesis with examples. And Mr. Walker, who referred only briefly to the Charleston, S.C., church massacre when he visited the state last week, was in Nashville on Wednesday, where he spoke more in depth, The Tennessean writes, about the killing of five service members in a shooting in Chattanooga. He called for a change to laws banning military personnel at recruitment centers from carrying firearms.The governor, who has been a staunch supporter of gun rights, was also featured in a CNN segment on Wednesday, “Shooting guns and talking politics with Scott Walker.” Mrs. Clinton and other Democrats continue to struggle with the “black lives matter” campaign, The Washington Post reports. Wednesday’s newsletter misstated the location of a meeting between Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles to discuss efforts to raise the minimum wage. It was in Los Angeles, not in Washington. Like the Politics Newsletter? Get it delivered to your inbox.
