Updated, 9:31 p.m. | ASHLAND, N.H. â On his first full day as a declared presidential candidate, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey took a detour. He canceled a morning event in New Hampshire, the state on which he is staking his campaign, and headed to Portland, Me., to pick up the endorsement of its deeply embattled governor, Paul R. LePage â a man who is gripped in a veto-and-override standoff with a hostile Legislature, has exhausted many fellow Maine Republicans and is being threatened with impeachment by Democrats and independents. Say this for Mr. LePage, though: He makes Mr. Christieâs problems in his home state look puny. Mr. LePage alluded to as much. âI donât play the political game very well â never have, never will. Donât plan to learn,â he said at a diner here before offering a full-throated endorsement for Mr. Christie and his tell-it-as-it-is approach. Maine is hardly a crucial state in the Republican nominating process, though the border it shares with New Hampshire could conceivably help Mr. Christie gain a few votes there. The event amounted to a measure of political payback: As chairman of the Republican Governors Association last year, Mr. Christie poured millions of dollars into Mr. LePageâs hard-fought re-election victory and was a fixture on the campaign trail in Maine. Still, Wednesdayâs endorsement was the first of a Republican primary contender by a sitting governor, and Mr. Christie was gracious, calling Mr. LePageâs support âan incredible honorâ and praising him as someone who âknows what itâs like to engage in hand-to-hand combat to try to get things done for the people that elect you.â  The event was held at the same diner, Beckyâs, where Mr. Christie first emerged after the scandal surrounding the George Washington Bridge to support Mr. LePageâs re-election efforts. It had a hastily put together feel: There were no âChristie 2016â signs, only two napkins hand-scrawled with âBernie 2016â by two diner patrons who had just sat down for breakfast when the two Republican governors and a horde of journalists arrived. Mr. Christie and Mr. LePage repeatedly played up their willingness to say what was on their minds. âThis is a guy who knows how to make decisions,â Mr. Christie said of Mr. LePage. âAnd he doesnât wait; he doesnât put his finger up in the air to see which way the wind is blowing.â Mr. LePage joked that he made Mr. Christie look like a wallflower by comparison. âI say it the way I see it. Sometimes Iâm overly blunt,â Mr. LePage said. âI donât like to mince words. I like to get things done. And thatâs the only difference I can see between Chris Christie and I. Heâs a little bit shy. Iâm going to work over the next year to bring him out of his shell.â  Mr. Christie needed little coaxing to show his assertiveness in New Hampshire later in the day: At a house party in Bristol on Wednesday afternoon â where the host, Fred Schneider, introduced him as having âa hit-you-between-the-eyes attitudeâ â he ripped through his stump speech and slashed at some of his Republican rivals by name. He scolded Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky for his efforts to kill parts of the Patriot Act, saying he had made the country less safe, and took umbrage at Mr. Paulâs fund-raising off the issue. âPaul used it to raise money,â Mr. Christie said. âThe American people should not be used that way.â For Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, Mr. Christie offered a milder lecture on entitlement reform. Mr. Christie has called for gradually raising the Social Security retirement age and implementing a means test. âI saw Governor Huckabee say recently, âOh, this is terrible, you canât change the rules like Governor Christie is saying. That would allow the government to lie to us and steal from us,âÂ â Mr. Christie said. âLet me fill you all in and Governor Huckabee in on this,â he added. âThe lying and stealing has already occurred.â And Wednesday night in Ashland, N.H., Mr. Christie warned at a town-hall forum against voting for a member of the United States Senate, this time without mentioning any of the senators â including Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham â who are his rivals in the primary field. âTheyâve never had executive experience,â Mr. Christie told an audience at an American Legion hall, before mockingly impersonating a lawmaker-turned-president. âOh, itâs this new shiny toy â what do I do with this?â The governor made abundantly clear that he had little trouble seeing himself wielding the executive authority of the presidency when Cameron Theos, 6, asked if he could visit Mr. Christie someday in the White House. âI am not encouraging every child who comes to a town hall to be asking this question,â Mr. Christie said, before agreeing to accommodate the boy because he was the first to make the request. âBut weâre not going to go signing any executive orders,â he added.   A version of this article appears in print on 07/02/2015, on page A17 of the NewYork edition with the headline: Maine’s Governor Backs Christie for President.
