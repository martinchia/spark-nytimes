In the world of outside supporters to Hillary Rodham Clinton, no one has a more visible, and singular, role than David Brock, her former critic-turned-guardian. Mr. Brock created the opposition research-focused “super PAC” American Bridge, the liberal watchdog group Media Matters, and the pro-Clinton group Correct the Record, which is now coordinating with Mrs. Clintonâs presidential campaign. He is also on the board of Priorities USA, the super PAC that hopes to raise large sums of money in support of Mrs. Clinton. The question of how Mr. Brock would carry out roles with groups that have different legal definitions has come into clearer focus this week, as he is moving to the so-called coordinated side, working with Correct the Record alongside Mrs. Clintonâs campaign. Mr. Brock confirmed the move, saying that the legal restrictions on his activities if he had remained on the so-called independent expenditure side of the groups were “impractical.” Such groups are forbidden from coordinating their work with the campaign. He declined to get into specifics as to why, but people who have spoken with him say he was focused on paying attention to the activities of Correct the Record and Media Matters, which will play the biggest role in defending Mrs. Clinton throughout the campaign. Media Matters and another outlet that Mr. Brock is involved with, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, are nonpolitical 501c3 groups, which donât make independent expenditures. What he will be missing out on is directing the opposition research functions at American Bridge, which will be training its army of staff members on mining the speeches and activities of the Republican candidates. Correct the Record can have access to the research that American Bridge produces, but Mr. Brock canât lead that groupâs efforts. Still, had he remained on the independent expenditure side of the aisle, he would have been prohibited from working with any federal campaign or party committee. As for Priorities USA, which Mr. Brock left and then returned to amid a shakeup in leadership, he will be able to serve on the board but has to be walled off from being involved in programmatic decisions by the group. His role is now basically limited to fund-raising. Mr. Brock, who was a critic of Mrs. Clinton in the 1990s, has become one of her favorite defenders in the last 10 years. She is said to put a premium on loyalty, but his abilities as a fund-raiser have also become a valued asset.
