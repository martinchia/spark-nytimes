DES MOINES â Senator Ted Cruz on Friday night drew one of the largest crowds in Iowa of any candidate this year: some 2,300 Christian conservatives, who turned out for an unusual program featuring people Mr. Cruz called âvictims of government persecution.â The eight people included bakers, a florist, wedding planners and others from several states. All of them said they had been sued, fined or fired for refusing service to same-sex couples or for expressing opposition to homosexuality. Several of them were well known to audiences of right-leaning news media. Seated in a chair facing Betty Odgaard of Iowa, Mr. Cruz listened as she fought back tears recalling how she and her husband had been publicly attacked after refusing to rent their wedding event space to a gay couple. âYou have endured pain, you have endured the attacks, you have endured hatred,â Mr. Cruz said, reaching out to touch her arm. A close-up of her pained face was projected on large screens around the stage. The rally sometimes had the feeling of a daytime talk show, and at other moments of a religious revival, as the audience gave standing ovations to the guests for expressing their religious faith. But its purpose was entirely political. A caucus sign-up card and a pen were on every chair. Saying that millions of evangelical Christians had sat out recent elections, Mr. Cruz shouted, âIâm here to tell you we will stay home no longer.â Mr. Cruzâs strategy for winning Iowa is to consolidate Republicans now supporting other conservative candidates like former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, and to position himself to scoop up supporters of Donald J. Trump, whose appeal the Cruz campaign believes will wither by the winter. Mr. Cruzâs campaign, which spent a month organizing Fridayâs rally, has focused on how to triumph in Iowa with such precision that it let slip the exact number of votes it must win: 28,957. (Every campaign has such a number, but rarely lets it get out.) Although Mr. Cruz has declined to criticize Mr. Trump, the senator’s campaign manager sniffed at Mr. Trumpâs much larger crowd in Mobile, Ala., on Friday night. âIâd take these 2,500 people over 12,000 in a football stadium in Alabama any day,â the campaign manager, Jeff Roe, said in an interview outside the ballroom where Mr. Cruz spoke. âThese people are coming to be part of a movement,” he added. Mr. Trumpâs admirers, he said, âare going to be part of a show.â Indeed, Mr. Cruzâs rally was aimed at the hearts and minds of evangelicals, who have picked the winners of the past two Republican caucuses in Iowa. âLadies and gentlemen, please welcome our heroes to the stage,â Steve Deace, an Iowa radio host who supports Mr. Cruz, said in bringing out the guests. âThey find themselves on the front line of the battle for the soul of this culture.â Among them was Barronelle Stutzman, a florist from Washington State, who told of refusing to design flowers for the wedding of a longtime customer named Rob, who is gay, and called it a matter of conscience. âAs much as I loved Rob, I couldnât celebrate his wedding,â she said. âHe asked the one thing from her she could not provide,â said Mr. Deace, who traded off with Mr. Cruz in interviewing the guests. âHe went right out of there and reported her, like a George Orwell novel.â Although Mr. Cruz and others on the religious right call people like Ms. Stutzman victims of religious persecution, civil libertarians say they are in violation of anti-discrimination laws. Mr. Cruz called the Supreme Court decision sweeping aside state bans on same-sex marriage an abomination. âNow the Washington elites want to silence those who believe in the biblical definition of marriage,â he said. Directing attention to his special guests, he said: âWe are blessed today to be in the presence of heroes. Heroes who have suffered for living out their faith.â
