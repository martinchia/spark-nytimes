Donald J. Trump’s remarks on Senator John McCain’s military record do not appear to have damaged his standing in New Hampshire. The billionaire mogul is leading in the latest Monmouth University poll of Republican presidential primary voters in the Granite State, outpacing former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida by a margin of two to one. The survey was conducted entirely after Mr. Trump’s inflammatory comments suggestion that Mr. McCain was not a war hero.  âThe controversy over comments about John McCainâs war service do not appear to have slowed the Trump steamroller,â Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, said in a statement.  Many analysts predicted that Mr. Trump’s popularity would implode after the remarks, but the attention appears to be fueling his campaign.  The Monmouth poll shows Mr. Trump garnering support of a quarter of likely New Hampshire primary voters and Mr. Bush coming in second place at 12 percent. The rest of the Republican pack appears to be deadlocked, with Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida making up the second tier of candidates.  Mr. Trump is performing best among voters who consider themselves to be “very conservative” and he is more popular with men than he is with women.  Voters said that if Mr. Trump were to drop out of the race they would likely throw their support behind Mr. Walker, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas or Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, suggesting that his ascendance is doing the most damage to their campaigns.
