Senator Bernie Sandersâs presidential campaign replaced its California state director Wednesday, less than a month before voters in the delegate-rich state cast their primary ballots. Michael Ceraso, who had been directing the campaignâs efforts in the state, will be replaced by Robert Becker, who has run the Sanders campaignâs operations in other states. Mr. Ceraso, 34, said in an interview Wednesday that he wanted the campaign in California to devote more resources on supporting volunteers, digital initiatives and field organizing than on buying expensive television advertising. âI felt that we should be spending more on digital and more on the grass-roots team,â Mr. Ceraso said. âIt just came down to a disagreement.â When asked about the change, Michael Briggs, a spokesman for the Sanders campaign, did not provide details on why Mr. Ceraso was no longer with the campaign, but he praised Mr. Becker as âone of the most seasoned and savvy people working on our campaign or any campaign.â Mr. Becker was the campaignâs Iowa state director and also worked for the campaign in New York. Recently, he had been helping Mr. Ceraso with Mr. Sandersâs efforts in California, which holds its primary on June 7. Mr. Sanders has said that he is focusing much of his resources on California in an effort to amass as many of the stateâs 475 Democratic delegates as possible. A Fox News poll shows Mr. Sanders in a tight race with Mrs. Clinton in the state.
