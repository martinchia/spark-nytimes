Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016âs first proper bus tour. EVENT 23 Time: 8:20 p.m., Jan. 8 Place: Decorah, Iowa (population: 8,127) Site: Mabeâs Pizza, in a sweltering basement with a few more people than appeared fire code-appropriate Mood: Oven Food: chicken cordon bleu pizza, “Gismo” burger, one-half “broasted” chicken Delivery: âAnyone order a pizza?â Mr. Cruz asked, entering the room with two empty boxes. âThatâs what you call a government pizza. You pay for it, itâs an empty box.â Payment: Mr. Cruz proposed a plan to keep President Obama, an avid golfer, away from his day job. âCan we take a collection to pay his greens fees every day from now until January 2017?â he asked. âHe really canât do much damage at Pebble Beach.â Highlight: Mr. Cruz was asked if he could support abortions in cases of rape, setting off a few murmurs in the room. âPlant,â another man said quietly. Mr. Cruz thanked the questioner but gave no ground: âEvery life is a precious gift,â he said, adding that the issue was likely to come up âonce, twice, maybe three times in the general election debates.â When the man repeatedly interrupted, Mr. Cruz moved on: âSir, weâre not going to debate, sir. Sir, sir â free speech â sir. Thank you, sir. Next question.â The crowd applauded.
