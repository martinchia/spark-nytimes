Syrian refugees are not the only possible new arrivals that Republicans want to keep out of the United States. The terror detainees remaining at the prison in GuantÃ¡namo Bay, Cuba, are also not welcome, and Republicans say the Paris attacks will keep them that way. As they awaited a new proposal from the Obama administration for transferring detainees and closing the prison, top Republicans said that the plan was going nowhere in the wake of indications that a recent refugee from Syria who was allowed into France took part in last Friday’s terror attacks. “Imagine bringing K.S.M. here,” said a top Senate Republican, referring to Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, a chief planner of the Sept. 11 attacks still held in Cuba. Republicans argue that housing the terrorists on American soil could lead to escapes or prompt domestic attacks, an argument they believe will resonate even more strongly now. Federal prisons in Colorado and Kansas are seen as likely sites for permanently housing terrorists the government never intends to release. Closing the prison inÂ GuantÃ¡namo Bay has been a top goal of President Obama since his election in 2008, and there had been suggestions that the Pentagon plan could be made public as early as this week. But the violence in Paris and Mr. Obama’s trip overseas have thrown doubt on that timetable, and a senior administration official said on Monday there was no chance that a plan for closing GuantÃ¡namo would be put out this week.
