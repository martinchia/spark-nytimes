Chelsea Clinton’s spokesman of the last two years, Kamyl Bazbaz, is leaving the Clinton Foundation for the private sector. Officials at the foundation and Mr. Bazbaz said Thursday that he had taken a job in New York with the public relations firm The Pranama Collective. “Kamyl has been a critical part of our team, from ensuring our ability to share information about Chelsea and the foundation’s work in new ways to new audiences to expanding the understanding of how our programs are helping people all over the world,” wrote the foundation officials Craig Minassian and Bari Lurie, who is Ms. Clinton’s chief of staff. Mr. Bazbaz said on Twitter, “In the coming weeks, I’m looking forward to joining the great team at Pranama in N.Y.C..” Erika Gudmundson will take over as Ms. Clinton’s spokeswoman after the Clinton Global Initiative next month.  Ms. Clinton has increasingly been in the spotlight as she has sought a portfolio inside the Clinton Foundation and as her mother’s most trusted voice.
