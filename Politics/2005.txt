Mitt Romney‘s seemingly nonstop hospitality tour of the 2016 presidential field took him to Maine on Monday. After hosting Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and their families at his home in New Hampshire over the weekend, Mitt Romney and his wife, Ann, dined with Jeb Bush and his wife, Columba, in Kennebunkport, Me. The meal was at Walkers Point, the home where Mr. Bush’s mother and father, George H.W and Barbara Bush, reside. Both the former president and first lady attended the Romney luncheon, which was in the dining room of the main residence, according to a person who was told of the session. One of Jeb Bush’s sons, George P. Bush, also attended the meal with his wife, Amanda, and their infant son, Jack. The menu was not disclosed but the lunch-table discussion between the two families touched on a wide range of topics, including the big victory by the United States Women’s Soccer team on Sunday night. Mr. Bush will return to the area later in the week. He is scheduled to hold a retreat for his donors in Kennebunkport.
