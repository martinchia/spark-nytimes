Donald J. Trump flouted a rule set by Fox News during Thursday night’s debate by conversing with his campaign manager during a commercial break, according to two rival campaign officials. The conversation was first reported by CNN. Mr. Trump apparently met with his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, during the first commercial break on the debate stage, violating the network’s rule about candidates speaking with their staff members in the middle of the debate. Seeing the violation, Fox News let Mr. Trump’s opponents meet with one of their staff members during subsequent breaks. Mr. Trump’s conversation with his manager was a clear violation of the ground rules set by the network, but as the debates have gotten more and more heated, a lot of the rules have fallen by the wayside. Rules about talking out of turn, speaking over a candidate trying to answer a question and going extensively past the allotted time have been broken repeatedly.  Press officers for Fox News and the Trump campaign did not immediately return requests for comment.
