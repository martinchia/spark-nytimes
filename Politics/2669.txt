GREENVILLE, S.C. â Donald Trump delights in breaking the rules of presidential politics. Except, it seems, those governing the placement of campaign yard signs. A document his campaign distributes to volunteers and staff members in South Carolina lays out, in elaborate detail, where large signs bearing his name can and cannot be staked into the ground â touching on local law and the unspoken Trumpian rules of real estate. Not on interstate highways (I-85, I-26, I-385), it explains. âThey will be removed by the Department of Transportation,â the document states. Not on the “railroad side” of certain small town main streets âas this land belongs to the railroad company.â Not on church, university or government property âsince it suggests the organizations back a particular candidate.â Approved locations include intersections (âbut without blocking visibility around the cornerâ); âthe outside of a curve in a roadâ; across the street from exits of malls and schools. The Trump campaign is obsessed with the signs, a low-cost form of advertising that its candidate has perfected in his day job, by affixing his name to towers across the world. On Wednesday night, a campaign staff member bragged that the Greenville office had just received a new shipment of 12,000 such yard signs. Mr. Trumpâs real estate wisdom seems to have reached the authors of the memo, who suggest finding creative ways to lure eyeballs. âUse a series of three signs, spaced 10-15 feet apart,â it suggests. âThis catches the eye.â In Trump fashion, the document warns sign-placers to avoid wasting their wares on low-traffic spots. âPlacing a sign in front of the very last house on a country road,â it says, âis not optimal.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
