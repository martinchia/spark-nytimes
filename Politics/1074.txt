For weeks, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has been perched atop the Iowa polls despite a conspicuous omission from his campaign calendar: appearances in Iowa. On Monday, Mr. Cruz returns to the state for the first time in about a month. The trip will not be subtle. He is setting off on a six-day, 28-town bus tour intended to cement his status as the state’s front-runner. The campaign, prone to frequently using puns, has labeled the trip as the “Cruzin’ to Caucus” tour. The visit comes after a week in which two rivals, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, sought to capitalize on Mr. Cruz’s absence from the state with appearances of their own. Mr. Cruz is also facing increasingly aggressive attacks from his competitors, including the campaigns or allies of Mr. Rubio, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Huckabee. Even Donald J. Trump, who has largely resisted jabs at Mr. Cruz, is showing signs of frustration. In an apparent knock on Mr. Cruz’s faith, Mr. Trump has repeatedly said, vaguely but ominously, that not many evangelicals come from Cuba.
