Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the only member of the Democratic leadership who had not weighed in on the Iran nuclear deal, broke her silence on Tuesday and threw her weight behind the accord. âThis is not a perfect deal, and there are several elements I would like to be stronger,” she said in a lengthy statement. “But after working my way through the details and the alternatives, losing a lot of sleep, and having a lot of good conversations with so many people â I am convinced that moving forward with this deal is the best chance we have at a strong diplomatic solution, it puts us in a stronger position no matter what Iran chooses to do, and it keeps all of our options on the table if Iran doesn’t hold up their end of the bargain.” With Ms. Murray’s decision, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who is in line to lead the the chamber’s Democratic Caucus in 2017, stands alone among party leaders in his opposition. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the current minority leader, and Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, have been working assiduously to keep defections from President Obama’s top foreign policy priority to a minimum. So far only two Senate Democrats — Mr. Schumer and Robert Menendez of New Jersey — have come out in opposition. Ms. Murray’s decision could prove influential on other undecided Democrats, including her fellow Washingtonian senator, Maria Cantwell; Oregon’s two senators, Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley; and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. With momentum in the president’s favor, Democratic leaders have set their sights on not just sustaining a promised veto of a Republican resolution to scuttle the nuclear accord, but on holding enough Democrats to filibuster such a resolution before it can get out of the Senate. Opponents of the deal need all 54 Republican senators to vote for the resolution of disapproval — a likely outcome — and to win over four Democrats.
