Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has yet to decide if he will make a run for president, but his flirtation with the idea is giving him a lift in a new poll and it comes at the expense of Hillary Rodham Clinton. According to a survey from Monmouth University, Mrs. Clinton’s national lead among her Democratic rivals has slipped, with 42 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters supporting her nationally. That’s down from 52 percent a month ago, reflecting the toll that the controversy over her email practices as secretary of state is taking, and the prospect of Mr. Biden entering the race.  Mr. Biden now trails Mrs. Clinton at 22 percent, with by Senator Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, at 20 percent. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders were at 12 percent and 16 percent, respectively, in August. Meanwhile, former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia and former Gov. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, who are also seeking the nomination, continue to languish in the single digits.  âFor a guy who is not running for president, Biden sure is making headway against the front-runner,â said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute, in a statement.  The poll shows that Democrats would be even more likely to back Mr. Biden if he opts to run. And the selection of Senator Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, a favorite of the progressive wing of the Democratic party, as his running-mate could also increase his chances of winning the nomination. Despite attacks from Republicans who see her as the Democratic front-runner, Mrs. Clinton continues to be popular within her own party, with 71 percent of Democrats viewing her favorably. Mr. Biden matches Mrs. Clinton with a 71 percent favorable rating. Monmouth’s poll has a margin of error of 5 percentage points.
