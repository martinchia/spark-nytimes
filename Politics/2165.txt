Hillary Rodham Clinton said she would “probably not” vote for fast-track authority for the trade deal that President Obama is seeking, but she acknowledged that she once said positive things about “the potential” for the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.  Mrs. Clinton made the comments in an interview with Jon Ralston, a Nevada journalist, after spending Thursday in the state, which holds early caucuses.  Mrs. Clinton, who has not taken a yes-or-no position on the trade deal, which is strongly opposed by labor groups, is in a bind over an agreement she once praised as a potential “gold standard” for trade deals when she was secretary of state.   “I said positive things about the process and the potential,” said Mrs. Clinton, who occasionally called Mr. Ralston “Joe” during the interview.  “Some people don’t like any trade agreement, and some people are willing to take any trade agreement,” she said. Asked whether she would vote in favor of fast-track authority  if she were still in the Senate, Mrs. Clinton replied, “Probably not, because that’s a process vote, and I don’t want to say that’s the same as T.P.P.”  Mrs. Clinton has been criticized for not taking a clear position on the issue since becoming a candidate. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, indicated this week that trade deals, on balance, tend to work, a position consistent with his views when he was president.  Mrs. Clinton also spoke again about the shooting death of nine people at a black church in South Carolina; a 21-year-old white man, said to have been fueled by racial hatred, is accused of opening fire after sitting through a prayer study.  “We have to have a candid national conversation about race and about discrimination, prejudice, hatred,” Mrs. Clinton said.  “Unfortunately the public discourse is sometimes hotter and more negative than it should be.” She then turned her comments to Donald J. Trump, the real estate mogul who, in kicking off his presidential campaign this week, accused Mexico of allowing rapists and other criminals to sneak into the United States.  Without naming Mr. Trump, she said that a recent candidate had “said some very inflammatory things about Mexicans â you don’t talk like that” in political campaigns.  “I think he is emblematic,” Mrs. Clinton said.  But there’s another culprit, she said.  “Let’s just cut to the chase â it’s guns. We have to have a better balance,” she said.  Mrs. Clinton noted that there was widespread support for background checks for gun buyers, but that Congress had failed to act “in the face of tremendous pressure from the gun lobby.”  She said she witnessed it firsthand when her husband fought for the assault weapons ban as president in the 1990s. She did not say whether she would now support such a measure herself. An  assault weapons ban is far more politically contentious than background checks.
