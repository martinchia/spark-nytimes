BURLINGTON, Vt. — Donald J. Trump brought gridlock here on Thursday afternoon, as the police shut down two blocks of the cityâs main corridor and braced for an overflow of thousands of political activists who would not fit inside the intimate Flynn Theater for his rally. Authorities were surprised when they learned this week that Mr. Trump had distributed 20,000 tickets for a rally at a theater that holds 1,400 people. It was too late to move the event to a larger space by the time it was clear that thousands could be left shivering outside while the Republican presidential candidate spoke inside. The Trump campaign flooded the market with additional tickets when it became evident that supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the Democratic presidential candidate, were gobbling up tickets in protest. Deputy Chief Bruce Bovat, of the Burlington Police Department, said that people would be turned away from the theater, which usually hosts performing arts events, once its capacity was reached. More than half of the cityâs 100-person police force is working the event, he said, with dozens more from other municipalities serving as reinforcements. Burlingtonâs âTimes Squareâ along Main Street was cordoned off with metal barricades and a holding pen for protesters. âWeâre not going to allow any disobedience or anybody to get hurt,â Chief Bovat said. âBurlingtonians are peaceful protesters, for the most part.â By 4 p.m. the police estimated that there were about 800 people lined up for the rally, which was set to start at 7. Vendors who were not affiliated with the campaign sold “Make America Great Again” sweatshirts and pins, while those who opposed Mr. Trump sold shirts that read “You Can’t Trump This.” Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
