Good Wednesday morning from Washington, where President Obama continues to press for several favored deals, policies and initiatives. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin is traveling to Tennessee, an important variable in his electoral math. But the newest name to be added to the contender list on Tuesday might have represented the final “big announcement” of the nominating race. More than 20 candidates later, the field for the 2016 presidential race appears to be largely set. The latest entrant was Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, the 16th prominent Republican candidate to announce a campaign. Mr. Kasich is also very likely the partyâs last big-name entrant. The Republican field is bursting at the seams so much that one debate stage can’t hold them all. And the Democratic field, which is generally viewed as a tightening but not yet close fight between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, seems unlikely to gain a new contender. Some supporters of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. still hope he will jump into the race. And if he did, it would greatly change the dynamic. But his main focus has been on grappling with the loss of his eldest child, Beau Biden, to brain cancer at the end of May. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, meanwhile, appears more interested in the relevance that commenting from the sidelines brings. Her band of supporters has let go of efforts to draft her. Barring something cataclysmic, the initial phase of the race to succeed President Obama has come to a close. â Maggie Haberman Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. Mr. Obama will meet with small-business leaders at the White House to rally support for the renewal of the Export-Import Bank, an institution that divides the parties and hangs in the balance. Mr. Biden will meet in Los Angeles with the city’s mayor,Â  Eric Garcetti, a Democrat, to discuss efforts to raise the minimum wage as part of an administration-backed push to help the middle class. The partisan debate over the minimum wage has been a theme on the campaign trail as well. And Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, will be among the lawmakers attending a Bipartisan Summit on Fair Justice, co-hosted by the Coalition for Public Safety. Overhauling the criminal justice system is one of the few issues to gain traction in both parties, as many conservatives have called for changes and Mr. Obama has made repeated speeches recently calling for a decrease in incarceration rates. When Mr. Walker brings his presidential campaign to a Nashville restaurant on Wednesday morning, he will almost certainly address last weekâs shootings at the military sites two hours away, in Chattanooga. But will he discuss the killings in Tennessee more expansively than he did the South Carolina church massacre? During a visit last week to North Charleston, S.C., the Wisconsin governor talked tangentially about the nine deaths at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church nearby. He did not mention the victims, gun violence or the subsequent debate over the Confederate battle flag. By contrast, Jeb Bush, who is seeking to cast himself as able to win wide support in a general election, called the Confederate flag a symbol of racism in his own appearance in South Carolina. Dwelling on guns and the flag could have been controversial for Mr. Walker, a champion of gun owners who has said that outsiders had no place in the stateâs decision to take down the flag. Instead, he praised the state for âthe kind of leadership you provided for this country in what could have been a negative not just for you all, but for this country,â and he said that heâd never utter the name of the man charged in the killings, Dylann Roof. (Mr. Walker had previously made a statement of condolences, but last week was the first time he had visited the state since the shootings.) As for Nashville, where he is scheduled to visit Puckettâs Grocery and Restaurant, his remarks could be quite different. Federal investigators are looking into possible connections between the Islamic State and the Chattanooga gunman, Mohammod Youssuf Abdulazeez, who killed four Marines and fatally wounded a sailor. Mr. Walker has repeatedly called for the destruction of âradical Islamic terrorismâ and singled out members of the military and veterans. â Patrick Healy Fox News said that its debate for candidates who did not make the first-tier 10-person cut would be shorter than originally announced. Mr. Paul, in an attempt to reignite his presidential campaign, released a video in which he set a copy of the United States tax code on fire to show how serious he is about overhauling it. And Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, whose love of Bruce Springsteen has been mostly unrequited, said that he prefers Bon Jovi, who lets him play his music on the campaign trail. Mr. Kasich, a fiscal conservative who has recently taken more centrist positions, enters the race at the jostling bottom tier. But there is always a path to the presidency, and The Times looks at what his might be. Donald J. Trump â who on Tuesday gave a crowd the cellphone number of Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, with whom he has traded insults â leads in several Republican polls, but Mr. Trump has already lost the support of Rupert Murdoch, who controls many of the nationâs most important news outlets. And as part of its continuing effort to press Congress to back the Iran nuclear deal, the Obama administration has turned to social media to supplement Mr. Obama‘s frequent comments, including those on Tuesday in which he compared critics of the deal to Iraq war hawks. Mr. Trump‘s candidacy is being fueled in part by passions on talk radio, with people like Rush Limbaugh supporting his candidacy. Perhaps they could avail themselves of the many new ramen shops in Washington. Or maybe take a tour of the congressional cemetery. After several highly productive months, House Republicans appear to have run out of things to do until the August recess. Leaders had planned to spend the next few weeks finishing up their appropriations bills. But that process fell into disarray when Democrats and Republicans got into a fracas over the use of Confederate flags on federal properties. Unable to bridge the impasse, the House has simply given up on the process. While the House has passed a short-term measure to fund the nationâs highways, it must await action in the Senate, which is having trouble getting a bill off the floor. Without an agreement, the highway fund will hit empty on July 31. Now the House, which this year has tackled a major trade bill, changes to the Medicare system, cybersecurity, the renewal of No Child Left Behind and an ambitious measure to change the way drugs are approved, is in a bit of a holding pattern. They even shaved Friday off this weekâs legislative calendar, although Representative Kevin McCarthy, the majority leader, said that was to accommodate Democrats traveling with Mr. Obama to Africa. Up next: The Improving Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation Act, a measure passed in the last Congress. â Jennifer Steinhauer Their parents are increasingly contentious rivals on the campaign trail, which may prove a challenge, The Los Angeles Times writes, to the close friendship of Chelsea Clinton and Ivanka Trump. Mr. Sanders, The Washington Post writes, seems to have struggled to secure support from voters who might back Mr. Biden if he were to run. And on Monday, Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor, said in an interview that climate change was partly to blame for the severity of the droughts in Syria that contributed to the violence there that helped give rise to the Islamic State. Republicans called the view absurd, but there is scientific evidence to back the claim. The Hill takes a look. The aide behind Mr. Trump‘s candidacy, Corey Lewandowski, is known as an aggressive strategist who is a “bomb-thrower,” Politico reports.   An earlier version of this post misstated where Vice President Joseph R. Biden was meeting with Los Angeles’s mayor, Eric Garcetti, on Wednesday. The meeting is in Los Angeles, not Washington. Like the Politics Newsletter? Get it delivered to your inbox.
