Hillary Rodham Clinton compared Republican presidential candidates to terrorist groups when it comes to their views on women, arguing that their “extreme” positions are not right for 21st-century America. At a rally in Ohio on Thursday, Mrs. Clinton scolded Senator Marco Rubio of Florida for his opposition to abortion even in cases of rape or incest. She hit former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida for wanting to defund Planned Parenthood. And she criticized Gov. John Kasich of Ohio for banning public financing of some rape crisis centers.  “Now, extreme views about women, we expect that from some of the terrorist groups,” Mrs. Clinton said. “We expect that from people who donât want to live in the modern world. But itâs a little hard to take coming from Republicans who want to be the president of the United States.” Calling such policies out of date and out of touch, Mrs. Clinton dared her rivals to face mothers who caught breast cancer early because of screenings and girls who did not get pregnant because of access to contraceptives that were made available through government funding.  Republicans immediately took offense to Mrs. Clinton’s remarks. Amelia ChassÃ©, press secretary for the conservative America Rising PAC, called the comments outrageous and desperate.  Alison Moore, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, said Mrs. Clinton had reached “a new low.”  Mr. Bush added on Twitter that Mrs. Clinton’s priorities are wrong. .@HillaryClinton compares pro-life Americans to terrorists, but defends despicable PP treatment of unborn?
