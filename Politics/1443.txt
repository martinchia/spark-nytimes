Jeb Bush’s new campaign logo â Jeb! â was unveiled to guffaws that it was unoriginal and lacking in design elements, but for the former Florida governor, a throwback look appears to have been part of the plan. Mr. Bush’s logo dates to his 1994 campaign, when he lost to Lawton Chiles, the incumbent Democratic governor. He stuck with it over the years, and in 2002 filed paperwork to trademark the logo. The move was considered unorthodox at the time. According to a report from The Miami Herald, Mr. Bush intended to prevent groups that opposed him from using his name to raise money. Mr. Bush remained protective of the trademark over the years. In 2010, after he had left office, his lawyer accused a Democratic State Senate candidate, Deborah Gianoulis, of stealing his logo after she distributed campaign signs and bumper stickers that read “Deb!” After receiving a cease-and-desist letter, Ms. Gianoulis told The Florida Times-Union she had no idea about Mr. Bush’s logo and said “Deb” was her nickname. “Governor Bush is welcome to borrow the logo we used in my 2010 campaign,” Ms. Gianoulis said on Monday.  “All I ask in return is that his campaign put an exclamation point behind support for public education.” Mr. Bush’s trademark lapsed later in 2010, and he reapplied for it this year, according to filings with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Branding experts noted on Monday that Mr. Bush’s simple, first-name only logo works well with his 2016 bid, in which he is looking to play down his connection to a political dynasty. pic.twitter.com/PTcgx420KC — Jeb Bush (@JebBush) June 14, 2015  Erick Erickson, the conservative blogger, suggested that Mr. Bush’s logo is no worse than Hillary Rodham Clinton’s “H” with an arrow and argued that it would be hard to trump the success that President Obama had with “O” and a swooshing flag. “At least ‘Jeb!’ is consistent and carries some history with it,” Mr. Erickson said. “Unfortunately for Jeb Bush, so does his last name.” Follow the New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.
