SUMTER, S.C. â Donald J. Trump, who had kind words for Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina early in the week, ripped into her as weak on immigration on Wednesday after she endorsed Senator Marco Rubio, and the crowd of Trump supporters booed the mention of her name. âSheâs very, very weak on illegal immigration,ââ Mr. Trump said, echoing earlier charges that were a departure from his gentler remarks about South Carolinaâs governor in speeches this week. âVery weak,ââ he continued. âSheâs very, very weak on illegal immigration. You canât have that.ââ Ms. Haley, whose endorsement is a major boost for Mr. Rubio as Republicans head to the polls on Saturday, has served as a foil in Trump speeches ever since she urged voters last month to avoid âthe angriest voices.”  Mr. Trump joyfully embraces his anger in most speeches as reflecting the mood of the country. In a speech in Greenville on Monday, he called Ms. Haley, who is popular with South Carolina Republicans, âa very nice womanâ and âa friend of mine.ââ He said she had modified her original accusation that he was too angry, which she made in the official Republican response to President Obamaâs State of the Union address.  By Wednesday night, Mr. Trumpâs blandishments had changed. So had his audienceâs mood. âYou know, Nikki Haley gave a speech a couple of weeks ago and she said that weââââ Mr. Trump began, waving an arm to include the crowd.   There was a chorus of boos.   âItâs not good,ââ Mr. Trump said.  Then he flung into his criticism of her.
