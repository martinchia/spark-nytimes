Support for Donald J. Trump remains robust among Republicans after the first debate, according to a new poll from CNN that shows nearly a quarter of the party’s likely voters would support his nomination for president. According to the latest survey, Mr. Trump leads the Republican field by a large margin with 24 percent supporting his White House bid. Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, whose standing dipped after the debate, is in second place with 13 percent, and Ben Carson, whose prospects have improved, comes in third at 8 percent. The poll also shows improvement for Carly Fiorina, who appears increasingly likely to make the main stage â the top 10 tier â for next month’s debate that is hosted by CNN. However, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas remain locked in a three-way tie at 4 percent, meaning that one of them could be relegated to the second-tier debate in September. CNN’s survey, which had a margin of error of 5 percentage points, is in line with a Fox poll from this week that showed Mr. Trump maintaining his lead despite what some analysts called a mixed debate performance. The billionaire businessman was criticized afterward for being confrontational with one of the debate moderators, Megyn Kelly, and for his handling of questions about his previous remarks about women, but the debate does not appear to have damaged him. Republicans gave Mr. Trump top marks for how they think he would handle the economy, immigration, the Islamic State and social issues if he were elected president.  Despite that sentiment, however, 58 percent of Republicans think the party would have a better chance of winning the presidency if someone else was the party’s nominee.
