A tired-sounding Jeb Bush apologized to his major financial backers in a brief conference call on Wednesday afternoon, saying he never expected his presidential campaign to end so early, and in such disappointment. âIâm sorry that it didnât turn out the way that I intended,â Mr. Bush said, according to an audio recording of the call.  âWhen I launched the campaign in front of three or four thousand people in Miami, I anticipated a different result.â Mr. Bush, who dropped out of the presidential contest on Saturday night after a disappointing fourth-place finish in the South Carolina primary, acknowledged the unforeseen dynamic of the 2016 cycle, which featured an angry, frustrated electorate and a colorful cast of candidates. âThe reality was that you had a year of disruption, a year of outsiders making a compelling case to people who were deeply disaffected and angry, and I just didnât get the breakthrough that I needed in the early states and felt it was important to not move on without a clear path to winning,â he said. But, he added, he hoped that the nation would ultimately elect a like-minded Republican â though he did not name any of his rivals. âMy hope is that a conservative will win the nomination and that he will go on to win the presidency, for our countryâs sake, and I intend to do whatever I can to make that happen, now as a private citizen,â he said. The former governor of Florida said that since returning home to Miami with his wife, he had visited the gym and was âsleeping really well.â “I was amazed at the press coverage of the campaign and the lack of reality, to at least how I felt the campaign was,â he said. âFor me it was an incredible joy, an incredible honor and privilege to be a candidate for president.â And, he apologized again. âIt was an amazing group of people,â Mr. Bush said. âIâm sorry it didnât work out as I said.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
