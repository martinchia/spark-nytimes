Former Gov. George E. Pataki of New York announced on Thursday that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, arguing that his message of “people over politics” is the way for Americans to reclaim their government. A three-term Republican governor in a left-leaning state, Mr. Pataki said in a video released on his website: “My vision was not of partisan division. It was a vision about people.” Mr. Pataki, 69, started out as a little known mayor of Peekskill, N.Y., and in his video mixes images of himself in rural settings playing with dogs and talking to regular people with scenes of Manhattan and the rebuilt World Trade Center. “We need to recapture that spirit, that sense that we are one people,” Mr. Pataki said, drawing upon his experience of the leader of New York State during the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001.  A moderate conservative, Mr. Pataki enters the crowded Republican field as a long-shot candidate. He has been traveling in New Hampshire and Iowa while mulling a White House bid and has an event planned in Exeter, N.H., later on Thursday.
