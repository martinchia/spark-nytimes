The White House said Thursday that it was expecting 15,000 people to gather on its South Lawn and the nearby grassy Ellipse to greet Pope Francis next week at an official welcoming ceremony with President Obama. âTrafficâs going to be a mess,â said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, who provided the estimate at his daily briefing with reporters. Mr. Earnest noted that the Office of Personnel Management had issued guidance to federal agencies urging them to allow employees to telecommute during the popeâs three-day visit to Washington, which starts on Tuesday.  âDue to the increase in traffic, road closures, significant detours, crowded trains and buses, longer wait times at stops and stations, and related commuting disruptions on these days,â the agency said in a memo, those who work in the Washington metropolitan area âshould expect significant commuting delays and travel disruptions.â Parents throughout Washington also received notice from the District of Columbia on Thursday suggesting that they plan their children’s routes to school with the papal visit in mind. District transit will be operating on its regular schedule, wrote Kaya Henderson, the schools chancellor, âbut you should expect a number of detours and some service adjustments to accommodate road closures and increased customer usage.â She said the mayor had started a website to serve as âyour one-stop destination for information on the papal visit.â Follow the New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.
