Good Tuesday morning. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin may have followed former Gov.Â Rick Perry of Texas off the trail to âclear the field,â but Washington is gaining both a boldface name and hundreds of thousands of members in his entourage. The pope descends on a Capitol ready for complicated logisticsÂ and full of competing voices claiming his message as their own.Â  Pope Francis is scheduled to arrive in Washington on Tuesday to a city bursting with anticipation and bracing for gridlock as politicians and activists maneuver to put the popeâs message and presence to use for their own causes. With expectations high that the pontiff will comment on climate change, criminal justice overhaul, the sanctity of life, immigration and mounting income inequality, among other issues, those engaged on the subjects are eager to invoke the popeâs views as supporting their own. For instance, contract workers who provide cleaning and food services at the Capitol plan a brief strike in the morning where Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is expected to speak and offer a prayer that lawmakers heed the popeâs previous statements on worker rights. Senate Democrats will be introducing climate change legislation tied to the popeâs visit and one later in the week by President Xi Jinping of China. Coming on the heels of House votes on new abortion restrictions, Senate Republicans are forcing a vote on Tuesday on a ban on abortions after 20 weeks though Democrats intend to block the legislation. Over the course of the popeâs three days in Washington, he will be cited regularly in calls for action. The papal events have Washingtonians who are anxious about the regionâs transportation system on calm days girding for the worst as tens of thousands of people pour in for what feels like a combination of a presidential inauguration, a high-level foreign visit and a religious celebration. But despite any potential inconveniences, Josh Earnest, theÂ White House spokesman,Â said on Monday, âthereâs palpable excitement and energy in this town.â âHeâs got a set of values and a way of carrying himself that really resonates with people,â Mr. Earnest said of Pope Francis. â Carl Hulse What We’re Watching Today âÂ  Hillary Rodham Clinton will present a plan to decrease the cost ofÂ prescriptionÂ medication, part of a series of campaign events this weekÂ devoted to health care policy and how she plans to âbuild on the progressâ made under the Affordable Care Act. â Â Ben Carson, who came under fire for comments on Monday that he did not believe a Muslim should be president of the United States, will make several appearances in Ohio, where he is sure to face further questions on the issue. âÂ  And a Senate subcommittee plans to hold a hearing on Tuesday to lookÂ into proposed health insurance company mergers.Â In announcing the hearing, Senator Mike Lee, Republican of UtahÂ and chairman of the subcommittee, said: âThe health care insuranceÂ industry is rapidly consolidating. If each of the recently announcedÂ transactions is completed, the number of major health insurers in theÂ United States would shrink to three. It is imperative that we closelyÂ examine changes in the health care market, and what has caused theseÂ changes, to ensure that consumers are not harmed.â â Robert Pear Walker Exits from a Windowless Room ForÂ Mr. Walker,Â who is fond of joking that âMadison is 68 square miles surrounded by realityâ â a rendering of a quote first used by former Gov. Lee S. Dreyfus, the scene on Monday afternoon in the stateâs capital must have seemed surreal. AsÂ dozens ofÂ teachers and other public employee union members with whom Mr. Walker has often clashedÂ cheered in the bright sunshine outside the Edgewater Hotel, a few blocks from the State Capitol, Walker entered a small, windowless room in the hotelâs lower level, where about 70 reporters and photographers were waiting. In that room, with drab gray walls, at a podium hastily placed in front of an American flag and the Wisconsin flag, the 47-year-old governor read a terse speech announcing that he was suspending his campaign. Mr. Walker took the podium alone. His sonÂ AlexÂ stood in a doorway, but Mr. Walkerâs wife,Â Tonette, and their sonÂ MattÂ were nowhere in sight. Mr. Walker quickly turned after finishing his statement and exited a side door to shouts from the news media. Seventy-one days earlier, Mr. Walker had announced his entry into the 2016 race before thousands of wildly cheering supporters in a pavilion at the Waukesha County Fairgrounds, where speakers blared âOnly in Americaâ and a giant backdrop displayed his last name with a stylized American flag replacing the letter âe.âÂ  Matt and Alex were M.C.s then, and Mrs. Walker spoke proudly of her husbandâs ability to âfight and win.â â Kay Nolan Some Old Friends Lend Support to Kasich Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio spent 18 years in Congress, leaving in 2001, so it is not surprising that he has some friends in Washington. But the co-host list of a reception and dinner here next month for his presidential campaign mostly reflects an earlier era. The $2,700-a-person dinner at a Capitol Hill restaurant will feature some current members of Congress from Ohio. But it is heavier on former members with whom Mr. Kasich served, and some of whom are synonymous with, well, previous decades. There is, for example, former Senator Alfonse DâAmato of New York, who lost his re-election in 1998. Also on the list is the former Indiana congressman Dan Burton, who memorably tried to re-enact (whether it was with a pumpkin or a watermelon is a matter of dispute) what he asserted was the killing of Clinton aide Vince Foster. And there is Christopher Shays, the former Connecticut moderate, who has also been showing up at Mr. Kasichâs New Hampshire rallies. It is a reminder that Mr. Kasich, who came to Congress at 30 in 1982, has a political history that long predates his current tenure as Ohioâs governor. â Jonathan Martin Our Favorites from The Times âÂ Â Donald J. TrumpÂ answered questionsÂ about homelessness, student debt, and N.F.L. quarterbacks on Monday in a video Twitter chat, part of his strategy of relying primarily on social media, rather than traditional advertising, to reach voters. â Â Mrs. Clinton, afterÂ several pollsÂ showing her slipping orÂ Mr. SandersÂ takingÂ a lead,Â has increasedÂ her national leadÂ over the rest of the Democratic field, a CNN/ORC International pollÂ shows. â Â The Times takes a lookÂ at the two monthsÂ betweenÂ Mr. WalkerâsÂ entry in the race, pledging to âwreak havocâ on Washington, and his exit. â AndÂ Mr. CarsonâsÂ and Mr. Trumpâs comments about MuslimsÂ reignitedÂ a volatile conversation and exposed a fissure between many Republican leaders and elements of the partyâs grass-roots. Candidates Make the Rounds on Late-Night Shows On Monday night, Carly Fiorina sat down with Jimmy Fallon and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas spoke to Stephen Colbert. âI want to interview all of them, but I only have 200 shows a year,â Mr. Colbert said in his monologue. Later, in their interview, Mr. Cruz followed the line of humor: âThere are another dozen coming. In fact, Stephen, are you going to announceÂ tonight?â Indeed, candidates are flooding late-night television programs, but not just for their Nielsen ratings. The modern late-night television hosts â Mr. Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Seth Meyers and now Mr. Colbert â find many viewers online and through social media, and they drive coverage across many websites (think of how many things John Oliver has âevisceratedâ this past year) through sharing segments online. The shows also have the potential to create an invaluable asset for presidential candidates: a viral video. In reaching for those million or more viral views, candidates are agreeing to activities often reserved for actors and celebrities: participating in prerecorded skits, often in a self-mocking manner, set to be put online. Mr. Trump participated in aÂ mocking self-interviewÂ with Mr. Fallon, pretending to be speaking into a mirror. Mrs. Clinton took a faux telephone call from a Fallon-impersonating-Trump. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey begged to lip-sync to Bruce Springsteen. Mr. Sanders offered his thoughts on post-David Lee Roth Van Halen. And Jeb Bush âslow-jammedâ the news. And on Monday night, Mrs. Fiorina judged Mr. Fallonâs impression of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and âhummed a few barsâ of a song she had made up to sing to her dogs. The candidates also sit for the traditional couch interview, which has a propensity to drive coverage. Vice President Joseph R. Bidenâs interview with Mr. Colbert, for example, helped contribute to the surge of supporters urging him to run for president. And Mr. Cruzâs had a slightly pointed exchange with Mr. Colbert over same-sex marriage; the host had to tell his audience not to boo his guest. Keeping the flow steady on Tuesday, Mr. Trump will also sit down to some potentially pointed questions from Mr. Colbert, andÂ Mr. Kasich will speak to Mr. Meyers. â Nick Corasaniti What We’re Reading Elsewhere âÂ  Jonah Goldberg of National Review takes a look at the outcry over comments about Muslims by Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson, saying, among other things, that âDonald Trump is probably right that he has no âmoral obligationâ to defend Barack Obama. But he does have a moral obligation to dissent from bigotry and correct false statements made over his megaphoneâ; that the question of whether a Muslim could be president was an âentirely hypothetical and ridiculous questionâ meant to be âa wedgeâ; and that such questions were âexactly why so many people are disgusted with the conversation coming out of Washington.â âÂ  Mrs. Fiorina, who has been critical of efforts to lift sanctions against Iran as part of the nuclear deal, was paid $48,000 last year, BuzzFeed reports, for a speech to BNP Paribas, a French bank that was the subject of a federal investigation at the time for circumventing the sanctions. âÂ  BuzzFeed also writes, that Mr. TrumpâsÂ wealth and his staying power at the top of the polls is causing some hesitancy among Republican donors who âare hedging their bets on different candidates or are simply frozen in place.â
