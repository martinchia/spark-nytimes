Good Monday morning. The House is bracing for a leadership fight this week, and the Supreme Court returns. But the focus will shift more to the Democrats as they prepare for their first debate next week and as Hillary Rodham Clinton is rolling out new proposals and a strategy to highlight her organizational and structural advantages, even while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont continues to dog her in the polls. With the summer behind them, Mrs. Clintonâs campaign aides on Monday will announce a series of âleadership councilsâ in crucial March states, the latest effort to create an engaged network of organizers. At almost every turn, Mrs. Clinton uses her stump speeches to describe the importance of organizing, the absence of which played a role in her not winning the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. Her team had planned for weeks to unveil councils in crucial states â the first being Colorado, Minnesota and Virginia â as the fall push in the Democratic nominating contest began. But the leadership councils comprise dozens of top elected officials and superdelegates in those states, who will be asked to help target new volunteers and supporters, and who serve as surrogates in the news media in their states.Â The numbers make clear the work that Mrs. Clintonâs allies have put in since 2013 to bolster her prospects. The leadership councils will eventually be in all 50 states, a campaign aide said. And as with the Clinton campaignâs donor structure, the goal is âflatâ â meaning the top elected official isnât the leader of the group. Many of the people on the lists â such as Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a friend of the Clintons and the chairman of Mrs. Clintonâs last presidential campaign â long ago endorsed her, before she was actually a candidate, and when the âsuper PACâ Ready for Hillary was trying to stockpile endorsements. But in some cases, itâs the first time those endorsers have had a role in her campaign. And they serve as a reminder that large sections of the Democratic establishment have already committed to Mrs. Clinton, at a moment when Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is testing how much room remains for him to join the race. â Maggie Haberman What We’re Watching This Week âÂ Â Mrs. Clinton will hold town-hall-style events in New Hampshire on Monday and will be in Iowa on Tuesday. â Â Mr. SandersÂ will be in Washington through Thursday, and he will hold an event in Arizona, where in July he drew a crowd of more than 11,000. Martin OâMalley will be in Nevada. âÂ  Among the Republicans, Jeb BushÂ and Donald J. Trump have events in Iowa, and Carly Fiorina in New Hampshire. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will be in New York and New Hampshire. House Republicans Brace for a Crowded Leadership Race It is a defining week for House Republicans, who find themselves in turmoil after the announced departure of Speaker John A. Boehner at the end of the month. Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah further roiled the picture on Sunday when he announced he would run for speaker and try to mount a credible challenge to Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, currently the majority leader and No. 2 Republican. Mr. Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, is positioning himself as an alternative to the status quo and as a man able to bridge the divide that led to Mr. Boehnerâs departure â the gap between mainstream Republicans and a segment of House conservatives who want a more confrontational approach to both President Obama and the Republican-controlled Senate. Leadership candidates will be campaigning in advance of Thursday, when Republican are to choose their speaker candidate and fill other vacancies. But House conservatives are pushing for a delay in any subsequent vote for majority leader and whip, and the idea is getting some consideration. Some lawmakers also want those running for a higher position to give up their current leadership slots. At the same time, leadership allies want to impose new rules to punish lawmakers who vote against the partyâs candidate for speaker on the House floor this month. The exercise is turning into a very public soul-searching for House Republicans. And it mirrors the Republican presidential campaign trail, where outsiders like Mr. Trump and Mrs. Fiorina have vaulted ahead of established office holders, propelled by grass-roots activists clamoring for new faces. âÂ Carl Hulse Supreme Court Returns With an Eye Overseas The first Supreme Court argument of the new term, which starts on Monday, concerns a terrible train accident in which a California woman lost her legs â in Austria. She wants to sue the railroad in the United States, where she bought a Eurail pass on the Internet. The case is one of several on the courtâs docket based on events beyond the nationâs borders, and they seem to prove a point thatÂ Justice Stephen G. Breyer has been making on his energetic promotional tour for his new book, âThe Court and the World.â The world is increasingly interconnected, he says, and the Supreme Court must engage with developments around the globe. Later in the term, the court will hear two other cases that seem ready made for a second edition of the book. One is an attempt to collect almost $2 billion from Iran for its role in a terrorist attack in Lebanon. The other asks whether an American tobacco company may be sued in connection with what is said to be an international drug and money-laundering conspiracy spanning Afghanistan, Colombia, the Middle East and Russia. âThe Supreme Court must increasingly consider the world beyond our national frontiers,â Justice Breyer said last month. The new termâs docket suggests that he is right. âÂ Adam Liptak Our Favorites From the Times âÂ With Mr. BushÂ struggling to connect with some Republicans, his campaign has begun exploring whether to bring in his brotherÂ George W. Bush,Â a popular figure among Republican voters who could deliver a needed jolt to his brotherâs sluggish campaign. But there are risks, too, especially in a general election. â Mrs. Clinton will announce a series of policy proposals on Monday to try and curb gun violence. It is an issue that is sure to come up in next weekâs debate, as Mr. Sanders has shown some vulnerability on the issue, and Mr. OâMalley has criticized them both for their stands in the past and called on them to support his proposals. âÂ Candidates are accelerating their efforts in Iowa to win former supporters of Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin. âÂ Mr. Trump sounded uncharacteristically resigned on Sunday when it came to last weekâs mass shooting in Oregon, saying such shootings will continue in the United States âno matter what.â What We’re Reading Elsewhere âÂ Â On CNN on Sunday,Â Senator John McCain of ArizonaÂ warned the Republican presidential candidatesÂ that if they continued to âdisparage each other and impugn character,â they would âpay a price.â â Â The Wall Street Journal saysÂ that Mr. Rubioâs low-key strategyÂ continues to keepÂ him out of the âskirmishes that defineâ the Republican nominating contest and have helped him rise in the polls at an opportune time, âwith Donald Trumpâs momentum stalling, two candidates quitting, and KentuckyÂ Sen.Â Rand Paulâs campaign collapsing.â â And in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, NBC News reports, Mr. Trump maintains his lead, but he has dropped five percentage points in Iowa and seven points in New Hampshire, while Mrs. Fiorina and Mr. Bush have risen in both states. â The New Yorker examines the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders, which has found success “exceeding his own expectations.”
