LAS VEGAS â If he can just make it through his partyâs nominating contest, Jeb Bush â who speaks Spanish fluently and is married to a Mexican  â has long held up his ability to win over Hispanic voters in a general election. And on Wednesday evening, he will field questions from the sizable Hispanic population here, the latest Republican to speak at a policy forum sponsored by the Libre Initiative.  Libre, a grass-roots organization backed by the conservative billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, is dedicated to promoting the Koch networkâs guiding principles of economic freedom and limited government to Hispanics. But it also hopes to win them over through more traditional community organizing, such as helping undocumented immigrants get driverâs licenses and handing out turkeys on Thanksgiving.  Mr. Bush is expected to address the economy, education, health care, immigration and other issues. His scheduled appearance before the group comes a day after a bill to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities, where the authorities do not automatically try to deport undocumented immigrants, failed to advance in the Senate. The bill, which has outraged many pro-immigration and Hispanic groups, was co-sponsored by two of Mr. Bush’s Republican rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who addressed a Libre forum this month.
