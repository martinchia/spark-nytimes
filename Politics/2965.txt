Granting tax incentives to persuade corporations to share more of their profits with employees is one of the key ideas to emerge from Hillary Rodham Clintonâs recently announced economic agenda, which relies mostly on standard Democratic proposals to address stagnant middle-class wages and the overwhelming concentration of wealth among the richest Americans. Mrs. Clinton made profit-sharing a centerpiece of the economic platform she unveiled in New York on Monday. On Thursday, she pitched the idea to potential voters in Dover, N.H., at the first town-hall-style event of her campaign. âIt makes good business sense,â she told the crowd, citing a local company that shared profits with workers. âThis increases productivity, it increases loyalty to employees, it gives you a bond with employees.â The ârising incomes, sharing profitsâ tax credit Mrs. Clinton is proposing would give companies a two-year tax credit equivalent to 15 percent of profits distributed to employees, to be capped at 10 percent of wages. The credits would cost an estimated $10 billion to $20 billion over 10 years and would be paid for by closing corporate tax loopholes. If a company provided an employee earning $50,000 annually with a $5,000 profit-sharing payment, for example, that company would receive a $750 tax credit in return. âWe need to get businesses back looking after their employees and their customers and their country, not just their executives and their shareholders,â Mrs. Clinton said. Mrs. Clinton later took questions from voters on topics as varied as robocalls from telemarketers (âWe have the same issue at home,â she said. âItâs really annoying.â) to investment in the space program (âYouâre talking to someone who wanted to be an astronaut,â she said) and how she prefers to be addressed (âHillaryâs fine with me,â she said). At one point, a gaggle of environmental protesters interrupted, shouting âAct on climate!â Her profit-sharing plan echoes the kind of business-friendly economic approach of turning to public and private investment that Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, are known for. But it also highlights how Mrs. Clinton is different, and vastly more centrist, than Senator Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont who is also seeking the Democratic presidential nomination and whose liberal agenda of breaking up the big banks and imposing a tax on financial trades has helped to attract big crowds to his rallies and to fuel his surge in recent polls. Many of Mrs. Clintonâs proposals, including profit-sharing, are in line with an economic philosophy called inclusive capitalism. The philosophy holds that corporations have a role in easing poverty and that they should put less focus on stock buybacks and short-term returns to shareholders and more on long-term investment in employees, communities and the environment. âWhen companies share profits, not only do workers benefit, but the companies themselves see higher productivity and a stronger contribution to our economy,â said Alan S. Blinder, a former White House economic adviser under Mr. Clinton who helped Mrs. Clinton draw up her proposal. But other economists have expressed concerns about the idea, saying it lets corporations focus on profit-sharing rather than on increasing wages or benefits. âThereâs nothing wrong with profit-sharing, but it just shouldnât take the place of a healthy paycheck,â said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economic adviser in the Obama administration. Mrs. Clintonâs plan would make companies eligible for the tax credit only if the profit-sharing payments were above existing wages and benefits, a campaign spokesman said. Mrs. Clinton promoted her plan before voters as she came under sharp attack from the latest entrant into the Republican presidential field, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who struck a generational theme also frequently used by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. âWhat makes us a great candidate against Hillary Clinton is three simple things: Iâm a new fresh face â sheâs a candidate of the past. Iâm about as anti-Washington as you can get â she embodies everything thatâs wrong with Washington. And Iâve actually gotten something done, Iâve gotten real things done in a tough state,â Mr. Walker said.
