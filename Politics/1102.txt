On full display in all the pageantry of the Democratic National Convention as veterans gathered onstage last week was an odd backdrop: an image of the Russian naval fleet. And for this, convention planners have now apologized. The image at the convention on its closing night was noticed by a reader of The Navy Times, who realized that the image projected on the screens in the background certainly did not look like the ships  on which he â or his predecessors â had served. Naval experts consulted by The Navy Times concluded that the image was a composite of mostly Soviet-era ships from the Black Sea Fleet, which towered above the retired admiral John B. Nathman as he delivered a tribute to veterans. âDue to vendor error, incorrect images appeared briefly on screen behind 51 veterans during the convention and the D.N.C.C. apologizes for this mistake,â said an official with the Democratic National Convention Committee. The official continued that the âerror should not distract from the wordsâ of those who spoke about President Obamaâs record on veterans issues, noting that Mitt Romney did not mention service members in his speech. Mr. Romney does, however, frequently mention Russia, calling it a âgeopolitical adversaryâ of the United States.
