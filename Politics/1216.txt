Jeb Bush suggested on Tuesday that Donald J. Trump’s strategy, as he rides to the top of polls, was to “prey” on the “fear and angst” of the American electorate, and Mr. Bush reiterated his view that many illegal border crossings by migrant parents were “an act of love.” During an interview with the Southern Baptist Convention in Nashville, Mr. Bush was asked about Mr. Trump’s surging political fortunes before the first major Republican presidential debate on Thursday. Mr. Trump’s “harsh tone is wrong,” Mr. Bush said. Many Americans are alienated and angry, he said, adding, “They see America moving away from them.” But, Mr Bush continued, “I donât think politicians should prey on that fear and angst.” Instead, he said, “to win, and to go the right way, we have to unite rather than divide.” Mr. Bush took a playful dig at Mr. Trump’s celebrity and credentials. He was asked by the event’s moderator, Russell Moore, whether he ever imagined being on stage with Mr. Trump when he was growing up. “When I was growing up, we didnât have reality TV,” Mr. Bush said.    Mr. Bush was careful to express respect for Mr. Trump, whom he called the “front-runner” in the Republican field, but he made clear that he disapproved of his heated language. “We have a different tone and a different view,” Mr. Bush said. Mr. Bush repeated his belief that many border crossings were an “act of love” — a phrase that has raised eyebrows among some conservatives.  “This is the world we are in, when you canât express a pretty common-sense thing,” Mr. Bush said. “The great majority of people coming here want to provide for their family.” He added, “Itâs a pretty good value.” Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
