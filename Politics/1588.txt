Lagging in the polls, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky set aside his right to privacy agenda on Monday afternoon to take up another cause: derailing Donald J. Trump. Mr. Paul laid into Mr. Trump in an afternoon conference call, calling him “a bully” and an “empty suit,” and comparing him to the “emperor with no clothes.” “Are we going to fix the country through bombast and empty blather?” Mr. Paul asked. “Somebody has to challenge him.” Mr. Paul has made that his mission. He started the Republican presidential debate on Thursday evening with a verbal assault on Mr. Trump’s integrity, accusing him of pretending to be conservative and cozying up to the Clintons. He followed that with an op-ed in IJReview listing Mr. Trump’s history of liberal positions and calling on Republican voters to fire Mr. Trump and pick a serious candidate. On Monday evening, Mr. Trump responded on Twitter,  comparing Mr. Paul to a “spoiled brat” and saying he “was terrible at DEBATE!” TheÂ confrontation with Mr. Trump comes asÂ Mr. Paul’s campaign appears to be stumbling. HisÂ debate performance was panned and recent polls have shown him slipping into the bottom tier of candidates. Last week also brought the specter of scandal, as a close aide and the head of a “super PAC” that supports the senator was indicted on charges of hiding secret payments while working on the 2012 presidential campaign of Ron Paul, Mr. Paul’s father. Mr. Paul had little to say about that on Monday, instead reminding voters of his Tea Party credentials and directing his ire at Mr. Trump. “I think if no one stands up to a bully, a bully will just keep doing what they’re doing,” Mr. Paul said. “Unless someone points out the emperor has no clothes, they will continue to strut about, and then weâll end up with a reality TV star as our nominee.” Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
