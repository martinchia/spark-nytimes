Donald J. Trump insisted on Thursday that his phone call with Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, was brief and described it as âcongratulatoryâ instead of condemnatory, in contrast to news accounts of the talk. âThis is shocking,â Mr. Trump, the real estate mogul who is now running for president as a Republican, of descriptions of his conversation with Mr. Priebus on Wednesday that portrayed it as lasting nearly an hour. âThe call lasted for 10 minutes â maximum, maximum 15 minutes,â Mr. Trump said. Mr. Priebus, he said, âknows better than to lecture me.â He added, âWeâre not dealing with a five-star Army general.â Mr. Trump did not dispute that at some point in the conversation, Mr. Priebus asked him to soften his rhetoric, which has included some caustic remarks about Mexicans, and which has some party leaders deeply concerned in terms of the lingering effect the comments could have on the party’s chances of ultimate success in 2016. Mr. Trumpâs negative ratings in polls are high, but in terms of horse race numbers, he is doing well in early surveys, running in second place in New Hampshire. The early national polls will help determine who makes it onstage at next monthâs Fox News debate in Ohio. Mr. Priebus âsaid wow, youâre really doing well in the polls, you really hit a nerve,â Mr. Trump described the chairman as saying. Mr. Priebus added, according to Mr. Trump, âIt could be that youâll be number one in the polls.â âHe said, âWell, you really have hit a nerve, keep going,ââ Mr. Trump recalled. âHe said, âIf you could tone it down â I know thatâs tough â but if you could tone it down, that wouldnât be bad.â The reality TV personality said his aides have been in touch with Mr. Priebus frequently in recent weeks, but that no concern had ever been expressed about Mr. Trumpâs comments. âIt was more of a congratulatory call,â Mr. Trump said. Sean Spicer, a spokesman for Mr. Priebus, declined to comment.
