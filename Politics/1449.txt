Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey leaned on the podium with his right elbow, his standard let-me-give-it-to-you-straight stance, and gave one of his classic blunt warnings, this time setting up a nearly hourlong speech laying out his educational platform.  âItâs time we had a conversation about education that isnât defined by ideological dogma or by narrow, personal, institutional interests,â Mr. Christie told the packed room at Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. âLets talk about what real educational reform for America looks like.â But notably, Mr. Christie never touched on his recent abandonment of the Common Core, the set of nationwide educational standards that many conservatives abhor. He has previously denied that his new position against the standards is related to his presidential aspirations. Instead, Mr. Christie spoke at length on his educational record in New Jersey and how that would inform his vision for the country. And, although the speech was billed as focused on kindergarten through 12th grade, Mr. Christie spent the majority of his time tackling the issue of student debt in higher education, another frequent talking point on the campaign trail. âEntire generations are being saddled with debt,â Mr. Christie said. âThere has not been a town hall meeting Iâve had, in New Jersey or outside of New Jersey, since the beginning of the year, where someone hasnât raised the issue of student debt.â He called for an expansion of Pell grants and other federal education funding, saying Congress should expand student aid programs for people at the bottom of the economic ladder. But he criticized President Obamaâs plan to make community college free, saying, âWe know there is nothing free in the world.â He proposed âincome share agreementsâ as an alternative to student loans. His proposal would give students the option of paying a percentage of their income for a set amount of time to whomever fronts the cost of college. âWith an income share agreement, thereâs no lump sum to pay, so thereâs no downside,â he said, also arguing that investors in the program would have more incentive to help the student succeed to recoup their money. He also called for more transparency in college billing and spending, joking that students and parents had a right to know if a tuition increase was going toward building a new rock-climbing wall. And, like his speech Tuesday in Washington where he argued for a less rigid school calendar, he made the case for universities to offer both night and weekend classes, to let students who need to work their way through college hold down a steady job. His proposals for reforming kindergarten through 12th-grade education centered on a common theme for the New Jersey governor: confronting the teachersâ union. He spoke early and often of how he restructured teacher tenure in his home state and introduced merit pay for them. He lamented that he was unable to convince the union to agree to change the âlast in, first outâ layoff policy for teachers. âThe power of the teachersâ union has prevented us from using quality based layoffs,â he said. âItâs the worst policy that money can buy.â He also pointed to his expanded school choice in New Jersey as another victory over the teachersâ union. “This is a program driven by a simple principle — I think parents are better suited to make decisions about their children’s education than union leaders,” Mr. Christie said. But as he based many of his recommendations on his education record in New Jersey, reviews in his home state were mixed, most notably in the city of Newark, which has the largest school district in the state. In 2010, Mr. Christie helped secure, along with former Mayor Cory Booker, a $100 million donation from Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, to help Newarkâs floundering schools. Mr. Booker is now a United States senator representing New Jersey. The plan, executed in conjunction with Mr. Booker under the banner of âOne Newark,â contained some of the important elements of Mr. Christieâs education platforms, like eliminating neighborhood public schools in favor of a lottery to give parents more choice over which schools their children attend. But that had the unintended effect of leaving some families with children attending multiple schools across the city, and led to an uprising in Newark that helped elect Ras J. Baraka as mayor last year.  He was a vocal critic of the plan. Despite these issues, Mr. Christie, the product of New Jersey public schools himself, still seems to be sticking to school choice and other reforms he has made in New Jersey. As he said in his closing remarks, âWhen we dare to innovate and fight the status quo, we give our children a fighting chance in this new world.â Follow the New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.
