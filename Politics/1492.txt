Updated, 5:55 p.m. | Less than 48 hours after becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump began his Hispanic outreach with … “taco bowls.” Yes, taco bowls. On his social media accounts, including Twitter, Mr. Trump shared on Thursday afternoon a photo of himself eating what he called a taco bowl and offering a thumbs up at his desk in Trump Tower, along with the message: “Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!” Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! https://t.co/ufoTeQd8yA pic.twitter.com/k01Mc6CuDI — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2016  Hispanics, however, do not yet love Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has alienated many Hispanic voters with his campaign, which he began with a speech that dubbed some Mexicans as criminals and rapists. HisÂ rallies often include rowdy calls to build a large wall at the border with Mexico. Eighty-two percent of Hispanic registered voters view Mr. Trump unfavorably and only 8 percent view him favorably, according to a CBS News poll in April. And Hispanic leaders immediately seized on Mr. Trump’s taco bowl posts as demeaning. “Weâre going back to the day when politicians thought all they had to do was eat a taco or wear a sombrero to win our vote,” said Janet MurguÃ­a, president of NCLR (also known as the National Council of La Raza), the nation’s largest Latino organization. “Really? This is 2016 and those days are long gone.” Ms. MurguÃ­a said the tweet from the presumptive Republican nominee had “hit the Trump trifecta: clueless, offensive and self-promoting.Â  What we have heard from Trump is what he has said and proposed: building a wall, supporting mass deportation and an end to birthright citizenship,” she said. Ms. MurguÃ­a also said that Mr. Trump had missed the mark on his Cinco de Mayo Â menu choice. “I donât know that any self-respecting Latino would even acknowledge that a taco bowlÂ is part of our culture.” âI love Hispanics!â âTrump, 52 minutes ago https://t.co/b9mv7nUduN âTheyâre gonna be deported.â âTrump, yesterday https://t.co/HzFWUT1XFl — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 5, 2016  But for those hoping to experience Mr. Trump’s taco magic, they may actually have to head to his Trump CafÃ© â not the Trump Tower Grill, as he claims â and as some eagle-eyed reporters have already pointed out. The Tower Grill does not, in fact, offer taco bowls, but the Trump CafÃ© has them on Thursday’s Cinco de Mayo menu as a “Taco fiesta!” Julia Preston contributed reporting.
