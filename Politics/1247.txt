Senator Bernie Sanders was quick to offer praise for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday, portraying himself as a grateful ally of the vice presidentâs and perhaps an appealing alternative to Democratic voters who might have been drawn to a Biden candidacy. Addressing reporters outside Penn Station in Manhattan, Mr. Sanders said it was âhard to sayâ how Mr. Bidenâs decision would affect the presidential race. He was more interested in paying tribute to the vice president, describing him as âa man who has devoted his entire life to public service and to the well being of working families and the middle class.â In particular, Mr. Sanders said he wanted to thank Mr. Biden and President Obama for their work to improve the economy. âObviously, we have a long way to go,â the senator said. âBut because of Joe Biden, because of President Obama, we have seen significant progress in the last seven years.â He also portrayed Mr. Biden as a like-minded partner in confronting some of the issues that he has focused on in his campaign, including combating income inequality and the influence of wealth on elections. âI look forward to working with Joe Biden, who I know will remain active in these struggles,â Mr. Sanders said. In response to a question, Mr. Sanders also agreed with Mr. Bidenâs assertion on Wednesday that Republicans should not be viewed as enemies â in contrast to Hillary Rodham Clintonâs comment in last weekâs debate that she considered Republicans to be among her enemies. Mr. Sanders suggested âopponentsâ with âstrong differences of opinionâ might be better a description. âThere is no issue that we donât have fundamental disagreements,â he said. âBut I would not use the word quote-unquote enemies to describe fellow Americans.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
