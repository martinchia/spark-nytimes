Gov. Chris Christie will announce Tuesday in Livingston, N.J., whether he will run for president in 2016, a source close to his campaign confirmed.  Mr. Christie has been traveling the country under the banner of his political organization, Leadership Matters for America, delivering policy heavy speeches on entitlement reform and education, along with holding town hall meetings as part of a “Tell It Like It Is” tour.  Mr. Christie will make his announcement at Livingston High School, his alma mater.  A spokesman for the New Jersey governor declined to comment.  Once considered a Republican front-runner, Mr. Christie has since seen his national standing decline, as he has struggled to overcome the George Washington Bridge scandal and low approval ratings in his home state. The news of his announcement was first reported by WNYC.
