It was a relatively quiet Sunday on the talk shows, with candidates likely saving their energies (or enjoying a holiday) before a burst of activity on Labor Day, the traditional start of the campaign season. In truth, the presidential campaign has been blowing at near gale force for months.  Candidates were joined on Sunday by three prominent Republicans from the past, Sarah Palin, Colin Powell and Dick Cheney, who also made a bit of news. Carly Fiorina  Mrs. Fiorina, the former Silicon Valley executive, told CBSâs âFace the Nationâ that she does not believe Hillary Rodham Clintonâs explanation that she installed a private email server in her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., without giving it much thought.   “It takes a lot of work to install a private server system in your basement,” Mrs. Fiorina said. “It takes a lot of work to make sure that you are having the right connections to conduct both personal and professional business over that system.” Mike Huckabee Mr. Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, who is struggling in Iowa, where he won the 2008 Republican caucuses, is taking his campaign on Tuesday to Kentucky to a rally for Kim Davis, the county clerk jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. On ABCâs âThis Week,â Mr. Huckabee was asked by George Stephanopoulos why Ms. Davis was not bound by duty as a government employee to obey the Supreme Court. âWell, you obey it if itâs right,” Mr. Huckabee said. “So I go back to my question: Is slavery the law of the land? Should it have been the law of the land because Dred Scott said so?” John Kasich Mr. Kasich, the Ohio governor, appearing on the same show after Mr. Huckabee, disagreed with him about Ms. Davisâs legal obligation to follow Supreme Court rulings. âNo, I don’t agree with him,” he said. “I think, you know, the court has spoken, the court has ruled as everyone knows. I — or most people know — I believe in traditional marriage, but the court has ruled.” Sarah Palin Ms. Palin, the former Alaska governor and Republican vice-presidential candidate, said on CNNâs âState of the Unionâ that if a President Trump asked her to serve in his cabinet, she would like to be secretary of energy, but her tenure would be very brief.  âI think a lot about the Department of Energy, because energy is my baby â oil and gas and minerals,” she said.  âAnd if I were head of that, Iâd get rid of it.” Colin Powell  Mr. Powell, the former secretary of state under President George W. Bush, endorsed the nuclear agreement with Iran; called the concessions it exacted from Iran “remarkable”; and said skeptics forget that the Iranians âhave been on a superhighway, for the last 10 years, to create a nuclear weapon or a nuclear weapons program, with no speed limit.”  Mr. Powell appeared on NBCâs âMeet the Press.ââ “I say, we have a deal, let’s see how they implement the deal,” he said. “If they don’t implement it, bail out. None of our options are gone.” Dick Cheney Another alumnus of the George W. Bush administration, former Vice President Dick Cheney, appearing on “Fox News Sunday,” had a very different view of the deal with Iran. “If you look at what happened with respect to the Iranian deal, the only winner are the Iranians,” he said. “They got everything they asked for.”
