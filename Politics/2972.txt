View All Posts » BOSTON — Massachusetts officials said Thursday that they have an additional three months to bring the stateâs health care system in line with the national Affordable Care Act. The waiver, which was granted by federal officials on Wednesday, will allow the state to keep more than 100,000 people on state-run health insurance plans that do not comply with the requirements of the new law until June 30. âWe are determined to get this project back on track and get people out of this temporary coverage plan and transition to the program that they belong in,â said Sarah Iselin, a health insurance executive who was appointed last week by Gov. Deval Patrick to oversee repairs to the stateâs troubled efforts to update its online health insurance exchange so it complies with the federal law. Massachusetts created its own online marketplace for health insurance when it passed a health care overhaul in 2006. That website functioned as intended until it was changed last fall to bring it up to date with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. The site had problems determining whether many applicants were eligibile for the federal subsidies, and left tens of thousands of applications to be processed by hand. Unable to immediately enroll applicants in new, private plans under the Affordable Care Act, state officials extended existing state coverage for about 124,000 individuals, and granted temporary state coverage to about 30,000 new applicants. Those individuals were supposed to move onto new plans by March. 31; the federal waiver gives officials another three months to do that. âThis is not a position we wanted to be in,â said Ms. Iselin, who said there was a backlog of an additional 50,000 applications that had yet to be processed. A health care technology firm, Optum, has been hired by the state to help process those applications and improve the functionality of the exchange website. Last week, state officials released a report by an outside technology firm, Mitre Corporation, that criticized both the state and its principal contractor, CGI, for the failure of Massachusettsâ new health exchange website. The report said that state organizations leading the websiteâs overhaul lacked a âunified visionâ for the project and that CGI lacked adequate expertise, managed the project poorly, lost data and failed to do enough testing before the launch of the new site.  The problems have been embarrassing to proponents of the federal health care overhaul who have pointed to Massachusetts as a successful implementation of a health exchange and an individual mandate. Ms. Iselin said that part of the challenge here was that Massachusetts, which had the only state insurance marketplace before the Affordable Care Act was passed, was not simply extending coverage to new individuals but moving people from its old system to a new one. âIn some ways, itâs made this part of implementing the A.C.A. more complex for us than other places that didnât have the same long history of these incremental expansions,â she said. The state originally asked for a six-month extension. Ms Iselin said it was âtoo soon too tellâ whether they would need more than the three months they got.
