ORANGEBURG, S.C. â About 15 minutes into his stump speech at a barbecue restaurant here on Friday, Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio turned to discuss âthe glue that keeps us all together.â âThe power of the Lord,â he told the crowd. Mr. Kasich recalled that when he was a little boy, his father would have to pick his mother up late at night, driving on a winding, narrow road. He said he had always worried that they wouldnât come home one night â though they always did. âBut in 1987, Iâm in Washington, D.C., and I get a phone call,â he said. âThey didnât come home one night. A drunk driver hit them and killed my father on site, and my mother died the next day.â The crowd, sitting at long tables covered in red-and-white checkered tablecloths, let out gasps. âHas anybody ever been where your whole world was black, and you got a little pinprick of light?â Mr. Kasich asked. âAnd then when you see that, you know you got to just take it one hour at a time.â âThatâs when you know you got to lean on something bigger than yourself,” he said, “and I went through it, and I got to tell you: The Lord gave me the grace to fully recover and put me in a position to be aware of other peopleâs problems.â âMy parents didnât die in vain,â he added, âbecause I found the Lord, in a real way.â Mr. Kasich brought up the story on the same day his campaign released a new television commercial in South Carolina that invokes his parentsâ death, one of two ads the campaign rolled out on Friday. The message was about the same as what he said at the restaurant here: âI discovered my purpose by discovering the Lord,â Mr. Kasich says in the ad. Mr. Kasich thrived in more secular New Hampshire by appealing to moderate voters eager for a president who can balance budgets and work with both parties. Only a quarter of the voters in the state’s Republican primary on Tuesday described themselves as born-again or evangelical Christians, and of those voters, only about 1 in 10 supported Mr. Kasich, according to exit polls. In South Carolina, Mr. Kasich has stuck to his centrist message, but his campaign is also stressing his faith. About two-thirds of the stateâs Republican primary voters in 2012 were born-again or evangelical Christians, according to exit polls.
