Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York has held out on endorsing his former boss, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in the presidential race, saying he needs to hear more about her vision for the country.  But asked on Thursday if Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. should challenge Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic nomination, the mayor wasted no time in declaring his answer: No.  “Joe Biden is a great human being,” Mr. de Blasio said in a television interview with NY1’s Errol Louis, set to air on Thursday night. “I think heâs done extraordinary things for this nation.” But … “If youâre talking about the state of the presidential race, I think itâs pretty straightforward: We have a very impressive group of Democratic candidates right now,” Mr. de Blasio said. “I donât think we need additional candidates.” The mayor’s rebuke of a Biden candidacy came the same day that the vice president was visiting New York City — and holding a rally with Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is embroiled in an open feud with the mayor. The vice president and the mayor were not scheduled to meet during the visit. Mr. Biden has been actively exploring a third presidential bid, a move that would directly challenge to Mrs. Clinton, whose poll numbers have slid amid continued focus on her use of a private email server while she was at the State Department. Meanwhile, the insurgent candidacy of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has taken off in Iowa and New Hampshire, making the endorsement of the progressive New York mayor all the more valuable when (and if) he decides to get behind Mrs. Clinton.  For now, it seems that Mr. de Blasio’s discouraging words on a Biden campaign may have more to do with another political dynasty. At the rally in Manhattan, Mr. Biden called Mr. Cuomo one of the country’s best governors, as the two men announced a proposal to raise the state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour. Higher wages are one of Mr. de Blasio’s signature priorities, but the mayor was not included at the event.
