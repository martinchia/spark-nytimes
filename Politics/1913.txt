Hillary Rodham Clinton unloaded on Jeb Bush on Monday, calling it “deeply insulting” that he had suggested that Democratic presidential candidates had tried to appeal to black voters by offering  “free stuff.” In a question-and-answer session on Facebook, Mrs. Clinton lumped Mr. Bush together with Donald J. Trump and Mitt Romney, who made a similar suggestion in 2012, and said that Republicans have been missing the point when it comes to appealing to black voters. “I think people are seeing this for what it is: Republicans’ lecturing people of color instead of offering real solutions to help people get ahead, including facing up to hard truths about race and justice in America,” Mrs. Clinton said. The discussion started last week when Mr. Bush was asked about his approach to courting black voters. âOur message is one of hope and aspiration,â Mr. Bush said then. âIt isnât one of division and get in line and weâll take care of you with free stuff. Our message is one that is uplifting â that says you can achieve earned success.â Packing a lot in her response, Mrs. Clinton also said that taxes and criminal justice were additional reasons why Republicans might have a disconnect with African-Americans. “Republicans have no problem promising tax breaks and sweetheart deals to their corporate friends, but when Democrats fight to make sure all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care, early childhood education and job training, that’s giving away “free stuff”?!,” she said. “Talk about backwards.” She also arguedÂ that while Democrats were looking for ways to end mass incarceration and protect voting rights, Republicans were trying make it harder for people to vote. “That’s wrong, and it’s got to change,” she said.
