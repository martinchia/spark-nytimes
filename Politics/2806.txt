Donald J. Trump was pandering for votes when he failed to correct a rally attendee who said President Obama was Muslim and not American, Josh Earnest, the White House’s press secretary, said Friday. He called the lapse part of a âcynical strategyâ used by many Republicans. âI donât think anybody whoâs been paying attention to Republican politics is at all surprisedâ that the episode occurred at a Trump event, Mr. Earnest told reporters at the daily White House briefing. âThe people who hold these offensive views are part of Mr. Trumpâs base.â In a question-and-answer session on a wide range of topics Friday, Mr. Earnest demurred when asked whether Mr. Trump should apologize to the president, and declined to characterize Mr. Obamaâs reaction to the comments. But Mr. Earnest compared Mr. Trump unfavorably to another Republican who he said had responded more appropriately to mischaracterizations of the presidentâs religion and nationality. âIt is too bad that he wasnât able to summon the same kind of patriotism that we saw from Senator McCain,â Mr. Earnest said, referring to an episode during the 2008 presidential campaign when Mr. McCain of Arizona, the Republican nominee, took a microphone away from a questioner who had called Mr. Obama âan Arab,â shook his head and told her, âNo, ma’am.â Mr. Earnest said Republicans had been willing to tolerate hateful and racist sentiments because they believe it boosts their political fortunes, a dynamic he argued had contributed to gridlock in Congress. Mr. Earnest noted that the No. 3 leader in the House, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, had won his position even though he had once publicly described himself as âDavid Duke without the baggage,â referring to the former Ku Klux Klan leader.  âWhatâs also unfortunate is that Mr. Trump isnât the first Republican politician to countenance these kinds of views in order to win votes,” Mr. Earnest said. “In fact, thatâs precisely what every Republican presidential candidate is doing when they decline to denounce Mr. Trumpâs cynical strategy, because theyâre looking for those same votes.â The Republican presidential candidate Donald J. Trump did not correct a man who said President Obama is Muslim, during a town hall event in Rochester, N.H., on Thursday.
