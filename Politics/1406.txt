Republican presidential candidates were quick to pivot off the Supreme Court’s ruling to uphold Affordable Care Act subsidies, arguing that the decision shows the need to replace President Obama with a member of their party. Former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said that it should not be left to the Supreme Court to “save us from Obamacare.” “We need leadership in the White House that recognizes the folly of having to pass a bill to know whatâs in it,” Mr. Perry said. “We need leadership that understands a heavy-handed, one-size-fits-all policy does nothing to help health outcomes for Americans.” Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said the court erred in trying to correct Mr. Obama’s mistakes. The decision was another reason that he should be elected president, Mr. Rubio said. I remain committed to repealing this bad law and replacing it… — Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 25, 2015  Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin said the decision should be more motivation for Congress to overturn the law. “Todayâs Supreme Court ruling upholding the administrationâs implementation of Obamacare means Republicans in the House and Senate must redouble their efforts to repeal and replace this destructive and costly law,” he said.  Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said he was the man to lead the overturn of the law. “This decision turns both the rule of law and common sense on its head,” Mr. Paul said in a statement. ” As president, I would make it my mission to repeal it, and propose real solutions for our health care system.”  Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida said that if he becomes president, he will make fixing the health system through the private sector a top priority. “We need to put patients in charge of their own decisions, and health care reform should actually lower costs,” Mr. Bush said.  “Entrepreneurs should be freed to lower costs and improve access to care â just like American ingenuity does in other sectors of the economy. ”  The Republican National Committee decided to focus its statement not on Mr. Obama, but on Hillary Rodham Clinton and the 2016 election. âTodayâs ruling makes it clear that if we want to fix our broken health care system, then we will need to elect a Republican president with proven ideas and real solutions that will help American families,â said Chairman Reince Priebus. âHillary Clinton supports big government mandates and expanding the governmentâs reach into our health care system, maneuvers that have made our health care system worse off.â The statement made no direct reference to Mr. Obama.
