Join us for New York primary live updates. BUFFALO â On the eve of New Yorkâs primary, Donald J. Trump told a crowd here that he wanted to talk about something close to his heart. âI was down there, and I watched our police and our firemen, down on 7-Eleven, down at the World Trade Center, right after it came down,â Mr. Trump said on Monday evening. âAnd I saw the greatest people Iâve ever seen in action.â Mr. Trump did not seem to realize that he had invoked a chain of convenience stores, and the crowd did not seem to mind. He continued speaking without hesitation, recalling the bravery he witnessed after the attacks. But he quickly drew some attention on social media for misspeaking. Mr. Trump was addressing an enthusiastic crowd at an arena, the First Niagara Center, where he was introduced by the head coach of the Buffalo Bills, Rex Ryan. After recalling the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Trump explained that he wanted to talk about âthe New York values that we all know so wellâ â offering a very different take on those values than Senator Ted Cruz. âDespite its problems, we love this state,â Mr. Trump said. âWe know itâs going to come back. If Iâm president, itâs going to come back so fast, you wonât even believe it.â
