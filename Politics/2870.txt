Local news outlets in states with early primaries are teaming up to hold a Republican candidate forum in early August amid complaints that subsequent full-fledged debates are excluding candidates based merely on polling.  The New Hampshire Union Leader, along with news organizations in Iowa and South Carolina and C-Span, are sponsoring a candidate forum in Manchester, N.H., on Aug. 3. The forum, which will give each candidate five minutes to respond to questions, would come before the Aug. 6 debate hosted by Fox News, which is limiting the stage to the 10 Republicans leading in recent national polls.  âFox says only the âtopâ 10 candidates, as judged solely by national polling, will be allowed on its stage,â the news organizations said in a joint statement. âThat may be understandable later, but the first votes are half a year away and there are a lot more than 10 viable candidates.” The forum is not technically a debate but is expected to give candidates an opportunity to come up individually on stage and spontaneously answer questions.  With 15 Republican candidates currently announced, television networks and the Republican National Committee have been fearful that early debates will become chaotic unless participation is limited. However, lower-tier candidates worry that they will not have the chance to showcase themselves if they are shut out from competing so early in the election cycle.  So far Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey; Ben Carson; Senator Ted Cruz of Texas; Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana; Carly Fiorina; Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina; Gov. John Kasich of Ohio; and former Gov. George Pataki of New York have agreed to attend the forum. Representatives for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said they did not yet know if they could make it.  Allison Moore, a spokeswoman for the R.N.C., said the party was allowing the forum because the candidates would be speaking one at a time.
