Good Wednesday morning. On the day the pope came to Washington and drew nearly all the nationâs cameras with him, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of VermontÂ did their best to stay in view, covering the high costs of prescription drugs, the Keystone XL oil pipeline, and low-wage workers. But, on Wednesday, all eyes, including President Obamaâs and those of the gathering thousands, will be on the man in white. Pope Francis will celebrate his first full day in the nationâs capital on Wednesday, meeting at the White House with Mr. Obama and participating in a parade for thousands of adoring admirers before canonizing the Rev. JunÃ­pero Serra, an 18th-century Spanish missionary, in a Mass at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. Mr. Obama is expected to welcome the pope, who received a rock-star greeting as he arrived in Washington on Tuesday, complete with chants and shrieking crowds, by taking note of his unique standing in the world and his unifying presence. White House officials said the president had not mapped out any political agenda. âThis is an opportunity for two men who have so many values in common to talk about the efforts that they are taking in the respective and quite different roles to advance those shared values,â said Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman. The popeâs visit has stirred the sometimes-jaded capital, which can be blasÃ© or even hostile about the presence of foreign leaders and dignitaries. In fact, congressional officials are trying to tamp down enthusiasm for the popeâs address to a joint meeting of Congress on Thursday, urging their colleagues to conduct themselves with dignity â a trait not always exercised. âWe actually hope that we can show a little more decorum to the pope than we sometimes do at State of the Union addresses,â Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, a member of the Republican leadership, said on Tuesday. âIt is our hope on this side of the aisle and the Democratic side of the aisle that we can avoid the dueling ovations, the jack-in-the-box standing for this and for that.â âListen to one of the most famous and most respected voices on the face of the earth with the respect and decorum that is due,â Mr. Wicker said. â Carl Hulse What We’re Watching â Â Donald J. Trump, who canceled an appearance in South Carolina last week in the wake of criticism over his views on Muslims,Â will speak to theÂ stateâs African-American Chamber of Commerce in Charleston. â Â Carly Fiorina, who has soared in the polls after her success in the debate last week, will also hold an event in South Carolina. â Â Elsewhere, Rick Santorum will be in Iowa, Ben Carson will make two appearances in Michigan as he also struggles with reaction to his comments on Muslims, and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina will be in New Hampshire. Clinton Covers Lots of Ground in Rare Interview Mrs. Clinton was in a sharing mood on Tuesday, releasing a detailed plan on prescription drugs and, at a town-hall-style meeting in Iowa, revealing that she opposedÂ the Keystone XL pipeline. Then, perhaps to erase criticism that she was avoiding interviews, Mrs. Clinton sat for about two hours with the editorial board of The Des Moines Register, holding court on a raft of topics including Mr. Trump, Mr. Sanders, immigration, education and foreign policy. Some highlights to cap a busy day of Clinton news: On the success of political outsiders: Mrs. Clinton said that economic frustration was real and that politicians were paying a price in some polls. But she said that ultimately she thinks people will be drawn to a candidate with experience working with Congress and negotiating on the global stage. Immigration: Mrs. Clinton would preserve and expand Mr. Obamaâs executive actions to protect immigrants. She argued that mass deportations were wrong. âThe only way you could do that would be with intensive, intrusive police and maybe even military action, which I do not think anybody would support,â she said. Planned Parenthood: âI defend and I will continue to defend Planned Parenthood,â she said, referring to calls from Republicans to defund the group in the face of videos accusing it of selling fetal tissue for a profit. The group provides broad health planning and screening services, Mrs. Clinton said, and the attacks against it are âa direct assault on a womenâs right to choose health care.â Mr. Sanders: Mrs. Clinton said that he should share more about his plans to make college free for everyone and that she does not believe, as she suggested he does, that rich kids should get a free ride. Mr. Trump: âHe doesnât propose anything specific,â she said. âHe offers assertions.â Joseph R. Biden Jr.: âItâs totally up to him; whatever he decides.â On transparency if elected: âWell, you can count on me not to have a private email server,â Mrs. Clinton said. â Alan Rappeport White House Seeks Quick Appeal Over Health Care Ruling The Obama administration, which was handed a significant legal setback by a Federal District Court judge in Washington this month, is moving to quickly appeal the ruling that gave the Republican-led House standing to sue over the new health care law. In new filings, the Justice Department askedÂ Judge Rosemary M. CollyerÂ to allow the administration to quickly appeal her decision to the federal appeals court for the District of Columbia rather than move ahead with arguing the merits of the Houseâs claim that the administration is distributing billions of health care dollars that Congress did not appropriate. Administration lawyers said the judgeâs ruling is so potentially far-reaching that it needed to be challenged immediately instead of waiting on a final outcome that could reset the constitutional balance of powers. âFor the first time in our nationâs history, one House of Congress has been permitted to invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts to resolve a disagreement between the political branches arising out of the executive branchâs administration of a federal program,â the administration told the judge. âAllowing such a suit to proceed is a momentous step.â The House intends to oppose the request for an immediate appeal and instead wants to first fight out in court whether the administration had the authority to spend the money. â Carl Hulse Our Favorites from The Times âÂ  Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsinâs departure from the presidential race shows the limits of âsuper PACs,â as outside fund-raising groups cannot pay rent, phone bills, salaries, airfares or ballot access fees, and are not entitled to preferential rates on advertising. And as Mr. Walker heads back to his day job, there might also have been some lessons he could have learned, The Times magazine writes, from George W. Bush. âÂ  Mr. Trump, whoÂ is threatening to sue the conservative group Club for Growth unless it stops running political advertisements asserting that he wants to raise taxes if elected president, grew up in a Queens neighborhood that contrasts with the diverse area around it. âÂ  In Congress,Â Senate Republicans took the first steps to avert a government shutdown, scheduling aÂ vote on a temporary spending plan, while Senate Democrats offered a climate change bill that had no chance of passing but that they said would push for policies that could help them in 2016. âÂ  And the F.B.I.Â recovered work-related and personal emails that Mrs. Clinton said had been erased from the server she used as secretary of state, two officials said. Uncommitted Donors Offer Insight Into G.O.P. Race Uncertainty One of the most striking illustrations of the uncertainty of Republican presidential race is the number of high-dollar donors still on the sidelines â or who are at least not yet fully committed to a single candidate. This fact of political life was driven home on Tuesday afternoon on the 43rd floor of a Manhattan office tower, in the offices of the Blackstone Group, a private equity firm. A few dozen prominent New York business executives came to see Gov.Â John R. Kasich of OhioÂ at an event organized by the Partnership for New York City, an organization of chief executives in the city. It was not a fund-raiser, but a get-to-know-you session. The gathering, hosted byÂ the Blackstone chief executive StephenÂ A. Schwarzman, includedÂ Henry KravisÂ of the private equity firm K.K.R., andÂ Howard J. RubensteinÂ of Rubenstein, the media relations company. Some of the attendees have already raised money for other Republicans. But that they would still take the time to take the measure of Mr. Kasich highlights just how fluid the Republican contest is as fall approaches. â Jonathan Martin What We’re Reading Elsewhere â Â After a rough few days,Â New York Magazine writes,Â Mr. TrumpÂ âneededâÂ Mr. WalkerÂ to suspend his campaign to take some attention away from the negative coverage. âÂ  WhenÂ Jeb BushÂ defended his brotherÂ at the debate last week against attacks by Mr. Trump, it was a moment,Â The Washington Post writes, that ârefocused a campaign in desperate need of a âmoment,â and signaled the extent to which Jeb Bush has become comfortable â even eager â to highlight rather than play down his family ties.â â Â AndÂ BuzzFeed takes a lookÂ at past comments by Mr. Carson that the wide acceptance of evolution âwas something that was encouraged by the adversary,â and that the Big Bang theory was a âfairy tale.â
