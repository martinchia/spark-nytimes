As book titles go, it’s not exactly a beacon of optimism. But like the presidential campaign of its author, âCrippled America,â a new book by Donald J. Trump, is deliberately defying convention. (Its subtitle is less doomsday: âHow to Make America Great Again.â) The book is the latest entrant into a veritable library of literary offerings from this yearâs presidential field, several of which have become best-sellers. There is âAmerican Dreamsâ by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, âRising to the Challengeâ by Carly Fiorina, and âA Time for Truthâ by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Mr. Trump is by far the most prolific author in the Republican presidential contest, having written (with assistance) a raft of titles about finance and real estate since the 1980s. However, this is Mr. Trumpâs first campaign book â aides say itâs a blueprint for a Trump administration â and he plans to make the most out of the obligatory publicity tour. He will hold a news conference and book signing at Trump Tower in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday morning. The timing is auspicious: He has struggled to draw the kind of nonstop attention that his campaign once took for granted. At a recent campaign event in Iowa, Mr. Trump explained the logic behind the dour title, which is at odds with his campaign slogan âMake America Great Again.â Why not use that as a title? âEh, itâs too nice, because our countryâs in trouble,â Mr. Trump said at the time. âThen I was going to say âGreatness in America.â Then I said, âItâs too nice.ââ
