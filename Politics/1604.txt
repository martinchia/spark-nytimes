In his appearance in Texas with Bill Clinton on Thursday, George W. Bush called for an elevated political discourse in the 2016 presidential campaign, defended his difficult wartime decisions, and said he did not plan to campaign for his brother Jeb Bush. Mr. Bush, speaking at an event with Mr. Clinton in Dallas, complained that the Internet “is a brutal place these days for political figures” and said it made the campaign discourse particularly nasty. But he attributed that to surrogates and not to the candidates themselves. “I know Jeb and I’m confident Secretary Hillary will elevate the discourse,” Mr. Bush said of his brother, a Republican, and Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Democrat. “I can’t attest to their surrogates. I can attest to this surrogate: I’m not gonna be a surrogate.” Before announcing his presidential bid, Jeb Bush declared, “I love my father and my brother, but I am my own man,” and much has been made about how much (or how little) he would rely on his brother as a campaigner, particularly given how George W. Bush is still very popular in pockets of the Republican Party, but remains a divisive figure to others.  The two former presidents, speaking to graduates of a jointly sponsored scholarship program at George W. Bush’s presidential library, were both asked about their decision-making process. Mr. Clinton talked about the importance of postponing some critical decisions. “I’d say: ‘Can I kill them tomorrow? Because I can’t bring them back to life tomorrow.'” Without directly commenting on the war in Iraq, Mr. Bush said the turbulent circumstances during his presidency (unlike the comparatively peaceful years in Mr. Clinton’s two terms) “made it really imperative that you decide and decide decisively.” He said he “had to make decisions that protected the homeland â that was my goal and some of the decisions I had to make needed to be made pretty quickly because the enemy, that sadly still exists, doesn’t really care whether a president agonizes over a decision or not.” Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
