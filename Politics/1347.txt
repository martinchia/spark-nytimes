The mega-donors who helped Right to Rise, the “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush, raise over $100 million aren’t exactly the typical crowdfounding type.  But in an email to donors on Friday, Mike Murphy, the head of Right to Rise, urged them to do just that â contribute online to air an ad in the New England area supporting Mr. Bush during the Super Bowl, two days before New Hampshire holds its primary on Feb. 9. “Right to Rise USA will be running the first-ever crowdfunded television ad during the ‘Big Game’ on Sunday, February 7, 2016 â but we need your help,” Mr. Murphy wrote in the email, which was provided to The New York Times and confirmed by the super PAC. He explained that a 30-second spot in the New Hampshire/Boston media market costs $300,000, and asked supporters to make a donation and tell their friends and family. The email included a link to the website, Tilt, which much like Kickstarter â a popular crowdfunding platform â will not charge until the goal (in this case $300,000) is met.   “This is just one way to let donors and supporters of Jeb take part in the process and know what their money is going towards,” said Paul Lindsay, a spokesman for Right to Rise.
