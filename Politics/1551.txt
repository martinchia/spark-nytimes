Like many Twitter posts by Donald J. Trump, the one Wednesday morning seemed provocative and unprompted: In less than 140-characters, Mr. Trump said he felt that Fox News had been treating him “very unfairlyâ and he had âtherefore decided that I wonât be doing any more Fox shows for the foreseeable future.â Surely there was a backstory, right? In a statement on Wednesday afternoon, the network said that Mr. Trumpâs post seemed to have been prompted by its decision, shortly before noon, to cancel his scheduled appearance Thursday on âThe OâReilly Factor.â âThe press predictably jumped to cover his tweet, creating yet another distraction from any real issues that Mr. Trump might be questioned about,â Fox News said in a statement. âWhen coverage doesnât go his way, he engages in personal attacks on our anchors and hosts, which has grown stale and tiresome. He doesnât seem to grasp that candidates telling journalists what to ask is not how the media works in this country.â Shortly after, the Trump campaign released a statement of its own, saying that Mr. Trump stood by his tweet. âAs a candidate for president of the United States and the definitive front-runner in every poll, both nationally and state wide, including the just released poll in the state of Florida, Mr. Trump expects to be treated fairly,â the statement read. âAll you have to do is look at the tremendous ratings last night from ‘The Late Show’ with Stephen Colbert, where Mr. Trump was the guest, or the ratings from both debates, to fully understand the facts.â Wednesdayâs kerfuffle was the latest in an increasingly public feud between Mr. Trump and the cable news network. Mr. Trump was never a natural fit with Rupert Murdoch, whose film and television company, 21st Century Fox, boasts Fox News as one of its most profitable assets. And in recent days, Mr. Trump again took to Twitter to criticize both the network and one of its stars, Megyn Kelly, with whom he clashed at the first Republican debate.
