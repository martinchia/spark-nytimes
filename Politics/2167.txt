Eager to put their own stamp on the fight against terrorism, Senate Democrats have scrambled and put together their own package of proposals to fight the forces of the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS. Among their proposals, Democrats would like to see the creation of an âISIS czar,â the continuation of targeted airstrikes on ISIS strongholds and oil supply lines and new sanctions intended to harm nations that âfacilitate financial transactions with ISIS.â Democrats also tied the battle against ISIS to the resolution of the Syrian civil war that helped the Islamic State rise and to the removal of President Bashar Al-Assad of Syria.  âSenate Democrats understand that the Syrian war will only be resolved diplomatically,â said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, âwith all parties supporting the eventual removal of Assad. But we also know that we can do more to address the threats from terrorists.â  Senate Democrats also seek to tighten a visa waiver program with friendly countries, study encryption technology and improve airport security.  They are expected to continue to push another issue they think is a winner: measures to prevent anyone on terror watch lists from purchasing guns, which Republicans have repeatedly blocked. âPresident Obama is right to say that the first thing Congress should do is close the loophole that lets F.B.I. terror suspects buy assault weapons like those used in the San Bernardino shooting,â Mr Reid said. It is unlikely that any of these proposals will be given consideration before the end of the year — if ever — by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. The Senate, which is working this week to put together a spending measure to keep the government open, will most likely not even get  to a House-passed measure, which enjoys some bipartisan support, to curb the Obama administrationâs refugee program for Syrians.
