Jeb Bush continued to maintain he was merely thinking about a presidential bid when asked on Sunday if he was delaying an announcement to continue courting wealthy donors. Watchdog groups have complained that Mr. Bush has evaded campaign finance limits and disclosure requirements by not declaring himself a candidate, even though he has repeatedly visited early-voting states and hired a staff of political operatives.  Asked on CBSâs âFace the Nationâ if he was violating âthe spirit of the law,” Mr. Bush said, âNo, of course not.” He was pressed by the host, Bob Schieffer, on whether there was a scenario in which he would not run.  âLook, I hope I â I hope I run, to be honest with you,” Mr. Bush replied. âI would like to run. But I haven’t made the decision.”  Mr. Schieffer pressed again: âWell, what would have to happen between now and then to convince you not to run?” âWho knows? I have learned not to answer a lot of hypothetical questions,” Mr. Bush said. âYou’re probably going to run,” Mr. Schieffer said.   âI hope so. I hope I’m a candidate in the near future,” Mr. Bush said. It was Mr. Schiefferâs last broadcast of âFace The Nationâ after 24 years.  Mr. Bush thanked him for his contribution to journalism and added, âUnfortunately, you won’t be around for me to announce a possible candidacy.” On other Sunday political shows, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, coming off a crowd-pleasing tour of Iowa, continued to back away from an essay he wrote in 1972 about womenâs rape fantasies, which threatened to distract his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.  Mr. Sanders called the essay a piece of fiction similar to the best-selling â50 Shades of Grayâ series.    The essay, written for an alternative Vermont newspaper, âwas dealing with gender stereotypes, why some men like to oppress women, why other women like to be submissive,” Mr. Sanders said on NBCâs âMeet the Press.”  He added: âYou know, something like ’50 Shades of Gray,’ very poorly written 43 years ago.”
