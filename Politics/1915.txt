Donald J. Trump is maintaining a solid lead atop the crowded Republican field of presidential candidates despite what some analysts described as a subpar debate performance this month, according to a new Suffolk University/USA Today poll. The national survey found that 23 percent of those questioned would back Mr. Trump in a Republican nominating contest, with Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina trailing him, both at 13 percent. The results displayÂ significant progress for Mrs. Fiorina, who was in the single digits in July, and also shows improvement for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, whose support rose to 9 percent. The poll, which had a margin of error of five percentage points for its measure of Republican candidates, also suggests the toll that Mr. Trump’s barrage of attacks have taken on former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. His support has fallen to 8 percent from 14 percent over the summer. While Mr. Trump, the billionaire businessman, has maintained his lead, there are some signs of trouble for him within the data. At 27 percent, his favorability rating is the lowest in the field. âTrump is the Jekyll and Hyde candidate â strong when among conservative voters but viewed much differently once Democrats and independents are in the mix,â David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, said in a statement. Moreover, when asked to describe Mr. Trump in a single word, most respondents had unflattering things to say. Among the most common word associations were: idiot, jerk, stupid, dumb, arrogant, crazy, nuts, buffoon, clown, comical and joke. On the other hand, Mrs. Fiorina was widely seen as “smart, intelligent and knowledgeable.” People also had doubts about the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive, however, with significantÂ numbers viewing her as being dishonest and untrustworthy.
