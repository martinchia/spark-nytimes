Good Tuesday morning. Though the political world will be poring over the latest batch of emails from Hillary Rodham Clinton‘s time as secretary of state, Jeb Bush‘s campaign is hoping a new month will help bridge the sustained gap between his success in fund-raising and his lagging poll numbers. September has finally arrived, and for Mr. Bush, it isn’t a moment too soon. Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, has not had a seasonal respite from his breakneck fund-raising of earlier this year. Nor has he had a stretch of good headlines. Instead, he’s had Donald J. Trump, a middling outing in the first Republican debate, and a string of supporters wringing their hands about when things will improve. The “super PAC” supporting Mr. Bush is set to go on air with television ads this month in the hopes of turning around his numbers. Mike Murphy, his longtime adviser who leads the group, has publicly sounded unconcerned about Mr. Trump’s ascension and insists there is no need to act any sooner. At the same time, the campaign has had to trim its sails in terms of spending, budget cuts that aides described as prudent rather than desperate. Three junior fund-raising consultants parted ways with Team Bush in recent days; while they were described in some reports as “key,” their roles with the super PAC have ended as well. In many respects, this is the product of Mr. Bush running his pre-campaign and his super PAC in tandem for six months. When the two were disentangled, the campaign was flying without a net, and officials there took some time to adjust. His fund-raising team, by all accounts, has been among the more tumultuous campaign divisions, in part because of scheduling issues and in part because of personality clashes. They are still adjusting, it seems, since budget concerns were the main reason Mr. Bush shook up his campaign before it started. Mr. Bush’s aides believe he is held to a different standard from other candidates, much like Mrs. Clinton, and they point to a cash advantage that is still likely to dwarf that of his closest competitors. But Mr. Bush will need to start putting some points on the board, and soon, to shake off a rough beginning. â Maggie Haberman Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. President Obama arrived in Alaska on Monday evening for a trip to speak about climate change, rename a mountain and appear on a survivalist television show. On Tuesday, he will hike Exit Glacier, which is described as having a “moderately strenuous” trail, and tour the Kenai Fjords “to view the effects of climate change firsthand,” the White House says. And Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Rick Santorum will speak at the Northwest Family Leadership Regional Summit meeting in Iowa, where the public funding of Planned Parenthood will be a major topic. It’s a pivotal week for the Iran nuclear agreement as crucial remaining undecided Democrats make their views known, perhaps determining the deal’s fate a week before Congress is set to begin formally debating it. Five more Democratic House members on Monday announced that they would back the agreement, putting new momentum behind efforts by the House Democratic leadership to build a firewall against a possible veto override. On Tuesday, Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, is to disclose his position on the nuclear pact at the Institute for Global Studies at the University of Delaware. With at least 31 Senate Democrats now saying they would back Mr. Obama on the deal, the White House needs just three more to reach the 34 that would make a veto override impossible in the Senate. Mr. Coons and other undeclared Democratic lawmakers are being closely watched, including Senators Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee; Bob Casey of Pennsylvania; Michael Bennet of Colorado; Maria Cantwell of Washington; and Cory Booker of New Jersey. Bolstered by the strong likelihood of lining up 34 votes, Senate Democratic backers of the deal now hope they can assemble 41 of the 46 Democratic votes to block congressional disapproval of the legislation through a filibuster, sparing Mr. Obama from having to issue a veto on the measure. But the Democratic ability to succeed might not become clear until the Senate returns next week. Given the Democratic direction on the deal, its opponents now realize they might have to begin reversing some Democratic commitments when lawmakers make it back to Washington. â Carl Hulse Some influential Republican figures worry that Mr. Trumpâs suggestions that he would raise taxes in certain areas could catch on with rivals in the presidential race. Rick Perry has whittled down his staff in Iowa to one paid operative amid continuing fund-raising struggles. Ben Carson has tied Mr. Trump for the lead in Iowa, according to a new poll. And the size of the crowds that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has been drawing should pay its biggest dividends in Iowa. When Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. visits Miami this week, he will have an opportunity to sound out some of the city’s biggest Democratic contributors about a presidential run. It is not on his official schedule, but Mr. Biden will be the keynote speaker at a $10,000-a-couple fund-raising dinner on Wednesday for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee at the home of Stephen H. Bittel, a prominent commercial real estate developer who raised over $200,000 for Mr. Obama’s re-election. The vice president has longstanding relationships in Miami’s donor community, and, as he considers a White House bid, has been in contact with Michael Adler, another real estate mogul there who raised well over six-figures for the Obama-Biden campaign in 2012. Notably, Senator Bill Nelson of Florida will also be at the Wednesday dinner: Mr. Nelson, a supporter of Mrs. Clinton, said on Friday that he did not think Mr. Biden would run for president. â Jonathan Martin The suggestion by Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin that a border wall might also be worth considering on the United States-Canada border, was met, Fox News writes, by criticism from both parties. And Gerald F. Seib at The Wall Street Journal compares this election cycle to that of 1968, seeing similarities in the issues, tensions and the threats to establishment candidates. Republican hopes of taking back the Senate seat held by Mr. Bennet are faltering because of Republican Party chaos in Colorado, Politico reports. The New Yorker examines whether Mrs. Clinton is partly responsible for the Black Lives Matter movement. Like the Politics Newsletter? Get it delivered to your inbox.
