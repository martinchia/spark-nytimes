Jeb Bush’s Europe trip is intended to help bolster his foreign policy credentials for American voters, but in the countries he is visiting â Germany, Poland and Estonia â the visit appears to be making few headlines. A commentary in the German newspaper Der Spiegel ahead of Mr. Bush’s arrival argued that while the former Republican governor of Florida is more rational and careful than his brother, former President George W. Bush, his reluctance to make amends with Cuba and Iran are problematic. Mr. Bush heads to Poland on Wednesday to meet with President-elect Andrzej Duda. Radio Poland described the trip as an opportunity for the likely presidential candidate to “highlight the success of neo-liberal economic policies in Europe.” It also referred to Mr. Bush’s older brother as “naÃ¯ve” on foreign affairs but said that the trip could eventually be helpful for securing military contracts between the United States and Poland. The article noted that there are 10 million Poles living in the United States and that some Polish-American groups have been critical of Mr. Bush’s stances on immigration. Mr. Bush concludes his European trip in Estonia. While the visit has garnered little media attention so far, it has not gone unnoticed among Estonian diplomats in the United States. During a campaign stop last week, Mr. Bush praised Estonia’s tax system and the fact that it takes only five minutes to file online. Estonia also uses a flat tax of about 20 percent, which might be less appealing to some Americans. The Estonians are doing it right!  https://t.co/vADteVnXGY — Jeb Bush (@JebBush) June 5, 2015  “It’s always good when someone is acknowledging what we do,” said Maria Belovas, a spokeswoman for the Estonian Embassy in Washington. “It’s good when people notice that and cite us as an example.”
