Good Thursday morning from Washington, where just across the Potomac in Arlington, Va., Lincoln Chafee, the former Rhode Island senator and governor, announced his candidacy for president with some words on measurements. But the campaign spotlight swings to Texas, where former Gov. Rick Perry will make his own announcement outside Dallas, and Hillary Rodham Clinton will discuss voting rights in Houston. And another politician with Texas ties, Jeb Bush, has a big announcement planned for June 15.
 The field for the Democratic nomination grew to four on Wednesday, and Mrs. Clinton now heads to Texas to give what her aides are describing as a major speech on voting rights and protections. Mrs. Clinton will urge a new national standard of a minimum of 20 days of early in-person voting, including on weekends and evenings, a policy that would benefit those unable to get to the polls easily on Election Day. Mrs. Clinton has been sharply critical of the Supreme Court decision striking down provisions of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, and her speech will be an extension of that criticism. Most significantly, Mrs. Clintonâs speech comes as her poll numbers, which were stratospheric as she left the State Department in 2013, are back on terra firma. A CNN/ORC poll released this week contained warning signs for Mrs. Clinton. About 57 percent of respondents said she was not trustworthy, a rise of eight percentage points since March. The poll came after weeks of bruising headlines about her email server at the State Department and questions about foreign donations to her family foundation. Most potentially troubling for Mrs. Clinton is that less than half of the people surveyed, 47 percent, said she cared “about people like me.” Mrs. Clinton is still ahead in the nominating contest by wide margins, polling shows. And her allies believe that, when she is compared with the eventual Republican nominee, her “cares about people like me” percentage will improve. The race is still in its early stages, but Mrs. Clinton will need to use her June 13 formal kickoff rally to demonstrate exuberance in her campaign, and in the crowds that come to watch her.

Biden Jr. and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, will attend services in Delaware for their son Beau Biden, the stateâs former attorney general, who died on Saturday at 46. The service will be open to the public. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will be the keynote speaker at the Prescott Bush Awards Dinner in Stamford, Conn. Donald Trump, who has said he will announce on June 16 if he is running for president, will appear at events in Iowa, including a benefit for veterans in Coralville. Mr. Perry, the former Texas governor whose 2012 campaign for the White House became a political disaster, is expected to announce on Thursday that he will run a second time. In a speech at the small municipal airport in Addison, Texas, a Dallas suburb, Mr. Perry is likely to make his case for the presidency by highlighting a Texas economy that boomed during his 14-year tenure as governor and by emphasizing his service in the military, as a pilot in the Air Force in the 1970s. Several veterans and military figures will share the stage with him, including Marcus Luttrell, the former member of the Navy SEALs whose memoir inspired the movie âLone Survivor.â It remains unclear, however, whether Mr. Perry can overcome the memory of his 2012 campaign and whether he has the financing, national organization and grass-roots support to break out of his status as a second-tier candidate in a crowded Republican field. Even some of his former advisers are only cautiously optimistic. âPerry provides a robust record of accomplishments that no one can rival,â said David M. Carney, a former political consultant to Mr. Perry who was a top strategist for his 2012 presidential campaign. âThe question remains: Can he put the other pieces into play and has his time passed? No one knows those answers,” he said. — Manny Fernandez Mr. Obama isn’t running for office, but he is starting to get busy ahead of 2016. The president is headlining a fund-raiser on behalf of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on June 19 in San Francisco, hometown of Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader. Ms. Pelosi will also be on hand along with Representative Ben Ray LujÃ¡n of New Mexico, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, at the Sea Cliff home of Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmentalist and major Democratic donor. Ticket prices are $33,400 and $10,000 a head. Invitations emblazoned with a drawing of the Golden Gate Bridge just went out. Mr. Obama’s efforts come as he is trying to persuade enough House Democrats to join with Republicans to pass special trade negotiating authority sometime this month. — Carl Hulse Under pressure to declare his political intentions, Jeb Bush has a big announcement planned for June 15. Though Mr. Chafee‘s campaign is considered a long shot, his foreign policy stances could put real pressure on Mrs. Clinton. Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor who is also seeking the Democratic nomination, told the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce that immigration overhaul would be an immediate priority in his administration and that he would tackle the issue within his first 100 days in office. And Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the fourth candidate in the Democratic race, has called for more and earlier debates, a move that could help him stand out in the growing field. Mrs. Clinton’s poll numbers may be down, but that hasn’t quelled all-too-early speculation about running mates. This time the focus is on Julian Castro, the housing secretary, to lure the Hispanic vote, Politco reports. Mr. Chafee kicked off his campaign on Wednesday night with a barrage of bold ideas such as forgiving Edward J. Snowden, banning capital punishment and keeping an open mind about talks with the Islamic State. While most of those policies drew little response from the small audience gathered at George Mason University, one proposal quickly raised some eyebrows and even some heckles. Mr. Chafee, a former governor and senator from Rhode Island, wants to convert the United States to the metric system. âIt doesnât take long before 34 degrees is hot,â Mr. Chafee said. âOnly Myanmar, Liberia and the United States arenât metric, and it will help our economy!â Then came the questions. How would you explain this to the American people? Donât American scientists already use the metric system? Why spend hundreds of millions of dollars making such a change in a fragile economy? Backing off a bit, Mr. Chafee said that it did not need to happen overnight, but that switching to the metric system would have economic benefits and the symbolic bonus of showing the world that the United States is not so unilateral. And it worked for Canada, he said, recalling his years living in Alberta during the 1970s when he worked fitting horseshoes at racetracks. Mr. Chafee said in an interview after his announcement that he had worried that making the metric system central to his platform might seem âtoo flaky,â but that it was an issue too close to his heart to ignore. âCanada wouldnât have done it if the cost was that high,â Mr. Chafee said. âItâs not that hard.â — Alan Rappeport “Just about every Republican presidential candidate,” The Washington Post writes, “is condemning Obama for a failure to grasp Americaâs exceptional nature.” But the president, the newspaper argues, has redefined “American exceptionalism” as a more “inwardly focused” notion that embraces “the darker moments in American history and celebrates the ability of the unsung and the outsiders” to “force change.” The Washington Post also sees some promising signs for two Republican candidates, arguing that a recent poll was “good news” for Mr. Rubio and that “Harry Reid just helped out Rand Paul.” Anita Perry, Mr. Perry‘s wife, said that his bid in 2012 was unsuccessful in part because, CNN paraphrases, “He hadn’t fully recovered from an elective back surgery, was in pain and didn’t get much sleep.” But, she said, “I want people to really give him a second look.” Like the Politics Newsletter?
