With anticipation building over the final Republican debate before the Iowa caucuses next week, one candidate is contemplating skipping it: Donald J. Trump.  In an interview with CNN on Monday, Mr. Trump again lashed out at Megyn Kelly, the Fox News host and moderator who asked Mr. Trump at a debate last year if previous remarks he had made were a “part of the war on women.” Ms. Kelly is one of the moderators at the debate on Thursday as well, and Mr. Trump said he might not attend. “Nothing’s 100 percent, I’m not 100 percent,” Mr. Trump said in the interview. “I’ll see. If I think I’m going to be treated unfairly, I’d do something else. I don’t think she can treat me fairly, I think she’s very biased. But that doesn’t mean I don’t do the debate. I like doing debates.” He was more pointed in his criticism of Mrs. Kelly, saying: “I don’t like her. She doesn’t treat me fairly. I’m not a big fan of hers at all.” Ms. Kelly, who hosts “The Kelly File,” with over 300 episodes aired, has opted not to participate in arguments with Mr. Trump.  A Fox News spokeswoman issued a response on Monday: âSooner or later Donald Trump, even if heâs president, is going to have to learn that he doesnât get to pick the journalists â weâre very surprised heâs willing to show that much fear about being questioned by Megyn Kelly.â Mr. Trump has threatened to boycott debates in the past. In October, he threatened to boycott if CNBC did not change the criteria. It did. In December, he threatened to boycott unless CNN donated $5 million to a veterans’ charity.  It did not, but Mr. Trump still attended. Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
