CONWAY, S.C. â Youâve heard the one about the frog in boiling water, right? You know, the old amphibian metaphor â intended to show that humans are sometimes unable to react well to gradual threats â about how a frog placed in boiling water will jump out, but a frog placed in cold water that is slowly heated will stay put and boil to death.   Yes, well. Jeb Bush was trying to summon that very example in response to a voter question here on Tuesday about the proposal by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic candidate for president, to provide free tuition at public colleges and universities. âThis is a great question, Iâm glad you brought it up,â Mr. Bush began. âBecause this notion that earned success in life, that the government can just take care of us, if we keep taking steps down that path, weâre in danger. And itâs insidious, because you donât see it until itâs over. Thatâs the problem with this.â Then, Mr. Bush went for the frog metaphor. And thatâs where the problem for him began. âItâs like the crabs in the, you know, whatever âthe crabs in the boiling water,â Mr. Bush tried. âFrogs,â an audience member shouted out, helpfully. âThe frogs,â Mr. Bush continued. âYou think itâs warm, and it feels pretty good and then it feels like youâre in a whirlpoolâyou know, a Jacuzzi or something.â He concluded with a morbid twist: âAnd then youâre dead. Thatâs how this works.â
