Jeb Bush said he was opposed to a shutdown of the federal government proposed by some congressional Republicans in their fight to defund Planned Parenthood â a tactic that Carly Fiorina, one of his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination, suggested she could endorse. Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, called such a move wrongheaded and futile. âI am against the government shutdown. Thatâs not how democracy works,â he said during an interview on âFox News Sundayâ with Chris Wallace. He said such a tactic would not succeed in stripping Planned Parenthood of federal funds under President Obama. Mrs. Fiorina, appearing Sunday on NBCâs âMeet the Press,â sounded open to a shutdown, saying it would force Democrats to defend what she called âthe butcheryâ of Planned Parenthood. âIf the president of the United States and Democrats are willing to stand up and defend this practice and shut down the government over it, then let them explain it to the American people,â she said. Asked if she wanted a congressional showdown, Mrs. Fiorina said: âI believe there are a variety of ways to deal with this. But I believe this is something we must stand up and fight for. Because it is about the character of our nation.â Mrs. Fiorina insisted that video footage she passionately described during the Republican debate on Sept. 16 â she said it showed a live fetus on a table as a Planned Parenthood worker sought to harvest its brain â âabsolutely does exist,â despite the conclusion of many news organizations that it does not. âDo you think this is not happening?â Mrs. Fiorina asked her interviewer, Chuck Todd of NBC News, when he said that âthe footage you describe at best is a reenactmentâ and that âeven the people that made the videos admit itâs stock footage.â âNo one can deny this is happening because it is happening,â Mrs. Fiorina insisted. During his interview on Fox News, Mr. Bush defended his proposed tax cuts, which, according to an analysis cited by the showâs host, Chris Wallace, would generate far more savings for the wealthy than for the middle class. âThe simple fact,â Mr. Bush said, âis 1 percent of people pay 40 percent of all the taxes, so of course tax cuts for everyone is going to generate more for those who are paying a lot more.â He added: âThatâs just the way it is.â Asked about his remark on Thursday that African-American voters wanted âhope,â not âfree stuffâ â a phrase that echoed a Mitt Romney critique of President Obama in 2012 â Mr. Bush repeated the phrase as he sought to explain it. âFixing a few big complex things will allow people to rise up,â he said. âThatâs what people want. They donât want free stuff.â Mr. Bush’s remark on Thursday came in response to a question by a white man in South Carolina about how Mr. Bush would appeal to black voters. âOur message is one of hope and aspiration,â Mr. Bush said then. âIt isnât one of division and get in line and weâll take care of you with free stuff. Our message is one that is uplifting â that says you can achieve earned success.â In 2012, Mr. Romney drew a wave of criticism, particularly from African-Americans who called his remarks offensive, when, shortly after he was booed at an N.A.A.C.P. event, he told voters that âyour friends who like Obamacare, you remind them of this: If they want more stuff from government, tell them to go vote for the other guy â more free stuff. But donât forget, nothing is really free.â
