Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio has been toying with running for president for months. By Tuesday morning, the fake mystery surrounding his candidacy will officially be over. The student union hall at Ohio State University, Mr. Kasich’s alma mater, was festooned with “Kasich for America” banners, volunteers milled about in bright red “Kasich for Us” T-shirts, and hundreds of eager supporters waited in the hot sun to get inside the hall. #Kasich team gets ready for his "special announcement." At least one thing in politics is on the level. pic.twitter.com/8JKgfBby6K — Sheryl Stolberg (@sherylstolberg) July 21, 2015  While pundits debate whether Mr. Kasich, who will be joining the large Republican field of candidates, is ”too big a jerk to be president” — as one Cleveland newspaper columnist put it recently â his direct style may turn out to be an asset, at least in the view of some supporters here. In interviews as they waited to get into the hall, some drew comparison to another candidate in the news, Donald J. Trump.  “The think that Kasich has a bit in common” with Mr. Trump, said Earnest Boyd, a pharmacist from Columbus. “He will say exactly what he feels. Kasich combines a solid legislative management with the ability to speak his mind in ways people get a little cranky about.” John Novotny, a dentist from the suburb of Thornville, agreed. “I like the way he speaks out sometimes; he doesn’t care if he offends people. He’s sort of ornery. He says what he feels and I kind of like that â it’s like he’s not kowtowing to everybody. I hope he stays that way.” Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
