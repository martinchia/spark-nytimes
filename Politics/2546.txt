Good Thursday morning from Washington. Congress is making plans to accommodate the pope, two former presidents are meeting while their families squabble, and the Senate has a lengthy to-do list. But that list does not include a cybersecurity bill the Senate deemed crucial only a few weeks ago. Computer snarls that temporarily shut down the New York Stock Exchange and grounded the United Airlines fleet on Wednesday were a vivid reminder of how reliant Americans are on technology and how jarring such failures can be. Though they were not attributed to a malicious computer attack, they underscored the continuing demand for cybersecurity legislation now entangled in Congress. A few weeks ago, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, said a major computer network protection bill was so urgently required in light of increased threats that he felt compelled to append it to an unrelated Pentagon bill. âThe need for this smart, bipartisan, transparent measure couldnât be clearer,â he said as Democrats blocked it. They did so because they believed he had attached the measure to try to trap Democrats into voting for the defense bill, which remains tied up in a budget fight. But since the impasse on the Senate cybersecurity legislation, there have been no moves to revive it. On Wednesday, Mr. McConnell said the Senate, which is currently considering a significant shift in education policy, would next move to a bill to renew the soon-to-expire federal highway program. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and the ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she was frustrated with the delay. âIâm hopeful that weâre going to get it up soon,â she said of the measure. âThatâs really up to Senator McConnell. As he would say, we donât run things around here.â The Senate legislative cup indeed runneth over. The education bill will take into next week to finish, the highway program requires action by the end of the month, and the Senate intends to deal with the expired charter of the Export-Import Bank. And cybersecurity remains a question mark. Jennifer Steinhauer Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will meet at the White House with Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch. And in the evening, Mr. Biden will travel to New York to speak at a Freedom to Marry event. As for the candidates seeking their own White House schedules, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will participate in an economic forum in Virginia; Senator Marco Rubio of Florida continues to introduce himself in Iowa; and Carly Fiorina and Martin O’Malley are in New Hampshire. And though there has been no announced Iran nuclear deal, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs will hold a hearing in the morning to “examine the implications” of such a deal. Speaker John A. Boehner‘s decision to open public outdoor viewing for Pope Francis‘ Sept. 24 address to a joint meeting of Congress will no doubt be considered a blessing by many lawmakers. Given the pope’s stature, celebrity and popularity, congressional offices were sure to be inundated with pleas from allies and constituents for access to the widely anticipated speech. Lawmakers hate to disappoint, particularly on the first time a pope speaks to Congress and to a huge television audience. The decision to allow the public to gather at the West Front of the Capitol to watch on Jumbotrons â and the ability of lawmakers to dole out tickets to that gathering â should take off some of the pressure. And the prospect of the pope making a brief outdoor appearance on the West Front will be an added draw. Despite the Capitol’s frequent hosting of world figures, the pope’s visit has presented unique challenges. The House was scheduled to be out of session on Sept. 24, for the observance of Yom Kippur the day before, but it was decided to call the House in because of the small scheduling window for the address, given the rest of the pope’s itinerary in the United States. â Carl Hulse Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said he was sticking to plans to have a womanâs portrait share the $10 bill with Alexander Hamilton, a day after Hillary Rodham Clinton, his former boss, said âa woman should have her own bill.â A “super PAC” supporting Mr. Rubio said it had raised $16 million through June 30, bringing the total raised by it and another group with ties to Mr. Rubio to almost $39 million. And Mr. OâMalley unveiled a plan for debt-free college education, staking out ground on a major policy debate ahead of Mrs. Clinton. Our Other Favorites From Today’s Times Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who on Wednesday said that Republicans were “in a hole” with Hispanic voters, is forsaking the heavy reliance on high-tech strategies and social media preferred by other candidates in favor of old-school tactics. As Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin prepares for his formal entry into the presidential contest, he has brought on a campaign manager, a pollster and a group of press aides. But he has not hired a strategist: Those who know him well say that Mr. Walker has always been his own. At a town-hall-style meeting in New Hampshire, Jeb Bush said his love for his Mexican-American wife was entirely compatible with his views on tightening the border with Mexico, calling an online skirmish started by Donald J. Trump âludicrousâ and âbizarre.âAnd earlier in the day, Mr. Bush said that if he won the presidency he would most likely close the United States Embassy that Mr. Obama is opening in Havana.  Reince Priebus, the head of the Republican National Committee, spent nearly an hour on the phone with Mr. Trump on Wednesday urging him to lower his inflammatory tone as the party becomes increasingly worried about damage he is doing to them, The Washington Post reports. Mr. Obama told Democratic senators, Politico reports, that the chances of an Iran deal were “less than 50-50.” And Mr. Sanders is drawing big crowds, has raised a substantial amount from donors and is closing in on Mrs. Clinton in polls, but, The Associated Press writes, “He remains far behind Clinton in the work of building a campaign organization.” CNN’s chief initially vowed not to cover Mr. Trump, but now the news network, like others, can’t get enough of him, Politico reports. Mr. Walker will begin his first days as a formal candidate in Iowa, The Des Moines Register reports, indicating his “dedication” to the state. Sure, Bill Clintonâs wife criticized George W. Bushâs brotherâs immigration policy. And, yes, Jeb Bush‘s campaign responded with a scathing statement that Mrs. Clinton was politically calculating. But who says the two former presidents canât sit down together for a good cause? On Thursday, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush, who share a warm relationship despite their family membersâ 2016 campaigns and their partisan differences, will participate in a joint discussion in Dallas, part of a collaboration between their presidential libraries to train future leaders. At a similar event last year, Mr. Bush praised Mr. Clinton as âan awesome communicator,â and Mr. Clinton said he admired how President Bush had approached issues with âclarity and decisiveness.â How much Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bush will be involved in the 2016 campaigns remains unclear, but they could be invaluable in fund-raising. According to a recent Gallup poll, 64 percent of voters said they had a favorable opinion of Mr. Clinton and 53 percent said the same of Mr. Bush. â Amy Chozick Wednesday’s newsletter misidentified the Democratic presidential nominee âin 1984. Though Gary Hart used a surprise victory in the New Hampshire primary to undercut Walter Mondale‘s aura of invincibility, it was Mr. Mondale â not Mr. Hart â who became the party’s nominee.
