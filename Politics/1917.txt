Good Tuesday morning. As the excitement and confetti of Pope Francis’ visit clears, the threat of a government shutdown loses some momentum (and NASA confirms signs of water on Mars!), the trail refills with old intrigues, especially those involving a certain vice president who has a schedule full of items to parse. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will travel to New York CityÂ on TuesdayÂ to meet with world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly â not a particularly unusual stop for someone who has spent much of his career steeped in international affairs. But when it comes to Mr. Biden these days, thereâs no such thing as a routine day trip. The visit comes as questions mount about Mr. Bidenâs political plans, and amid a seemingly endless round of whispers and tea leaf scrutinizing not normally associated with a vice presidentâs daily schedule. Each day brings a new rumor: Heâs about to announce heâs in! Heâs poised to announce heâs out! Heâs leaning yes! Heâs waiting to decide! And the truth seems to be, no one whose last name isnât Biden really knows. And maybe not even them. As some Biden advisers said, if the vice president does not know whether he will run, how should his staff? The latest speculation was stoked by CNNâs announcement that it would allow Mr. Biden into the first Democratic presidential debate onÂ Oct. 13Â if he joins the race as late as the same day. But that does not mean he will decide by then. At one point, the vice president had said he would come to a conclusion by the end of summer, but that has come and gone. Then, aides suggested the debate was the likely deadline. Now, they suggest a decision could come as late as November. Or it could come next week. He will decide, they say, when he decides. In the meantime, Mr. Biden is staying in the public eye. He makes a second appearance in New York CityÂ on ThursdayÂ to address the Concordia Summit, a global affairs forum, andÂ on SaturdayÂ night he will give the keynote address at the Human Rights Campaign gala in Washington. Just your normal vice-presidential speaking engagements. Or not. — Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Peter Baker What We’re Watching âÂ  The day after a tense meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia,Â President Obama will meet with President RaÃºl Castro of Cuba in New York. âÂ Â The House Ways and Means Committee will take up legislation to repeal central elements of the Affordable Care Act through a special budget procedure known as âreconciliation,â which is filibuster proof in the Senate. And as the House tests the political winds over shutting down the government because of Planned Parenthood funding, the groupâs president, Cecile Richards, is scheduled to testify beforeÂ the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. â Â And as current and former governors continue to struggle behind the political outsiders at the front of the Republican pack, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who has yet to break into the top 10, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has held steady near the back of it, will make appearances in Iowa. Mr. Christieâs is a âspecial announcement event,â his campaign has said. Bush to Release Energy Plan Tied to Lifting of Crude Oil Ban Jeb BushÂ will outline his energy plan on Tuesday afternoon at a business in Canonsburg, Pa. â the latest proposal from a candidate eager to establish himself as the fieldâs most policy-focused contender. According to campaign aides, Mr. Bushâs plan would lift restrictions on exports of crude oil and natural gas. In a post on Medium, set to be published on Tuesday, Mr. Bush cites studies estimating that retail gasoline prices would drop by 6 cents a gallon within three years as a result of lifting the crude oil ban. Mr. Bush will also repeat calls for the approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, criticizing Mr. ObamaÂ andÂ Hillary Rodham ClintonÂ for having, in his view, âbaldly politicized the government permitting processâ by opposing the pipeline. Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, is also expected to call for greater state authority over energy decisions. In recent weeks, Mr. Bush has released detailed plans on tax policy and regulatory overhaul, seeking to distinguish himself from rivals, particularlyÂ Donald J. Trump, whose policy proclamations have been considerably less precise, despiteÂ his introduction of a tax planÂ on Monday. âÂ Matt Flegenheimer House G.O.P. to Gather in Potentially Fiery Meeting to Plot Future Moving beyond the shock ofÂ Speaker John A. BoehnerâsÂ announcement that he will step down next month, House Republicans will gather on Tuesday evening for an air-clearing, members-only meeting to begin mapping their way forward. It is not going to be an easy task, and the meeting has the potential to be fiery. WhileÂ Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 2 Republican, appears in strong position to become the new speaker, fights are breaking out for posts below the top job as some Republicans push for new faces rather than just moving the current leadership up a notch or two. Republicans are going to want to use the meeting to set the parameters for the leadership elections. There is also the problem of what Republicans are going to do to keep themselves out of the position they now find themselves in, with an influential group of conservatives pushing policy and strategic moves that many of their Republican colleagues find counterproductive. Lawmakers say they need to find a way to resolve their strategic differences before they can coalesce around a broader vision. This session could take a while. âÂ Carl Hulse Our Favorites From The Times âÂ No longer satisfied with sitting on the sidelines and writing big checks, many donors are eager to play larger roles in the campaigns. âÂ Echoing a number of other recent surveys, a significant number of Republicans believe that the climate is changing and that humans play a role in that change. âÂ Mrs. Clinton said that the inability of the United States military to train Syrian rebels to fight against the Islamic State on the ground had exacerbated the crises in the region. âÂ As Carly Fiorinaâs presidential campaign gains traction, liberal women across the web are expressing conflicted feelings about her candidacy. At times, there is gratification at watching a woman forcefully take on Mr. Trump; at other times, horror at Mrs. Fiorinaâs conservative policy positions, which these women see as anathema to the feminist cause. âÂ In a speech at a retirement community, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida made references to his relative youth and to the perils of electing a president who does not understand the technological shifts underway. Candidates Offer Discounts on Swag to Bolster Campaign Coffers Had your eye on that Bernie Sanders âContents May Bernâ coffee mug? Or a Marco Rubio football T-shirt? How about that faux-Hillary Rodham Clinton hard drive from Rand Paulâs online store? Well, nowâs the best time to get the most for your money: Campaigns are starting to offer âflash salesâ in their online stores, so you can get official merchandise at decent discounts. But itâs not just to give supporters a break at the online checkout screen. With the coming quarterly filing deadline less than 48 hours away, campaigns are scrambling to increase their final fund-raising numbers, running deadline âmoneybombsâ online and, also, swag sales. Technically, any merchandise sale counts as a campaign contribution, often of the small dollar, hard money kind that make for good public relations, a sign of strong grass-roots support. If a campaign can get a bunch of supporters who wouldnât drop $20 on a T-shirt to reconsider for $15 or $10, it would help lower the average donation number, as well as increase the total number of contributions to the campaign for the quarter. So if you start to see a lot more âFeel the Bernâ or âDonât Drone Me Broâ shirts around your neighborhood, well, thereâs a reason. â Nick Corasaniti What Weâre Reading Elsewhere âÂ Â The New Yorker argues that Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon who, as he pointed out in the first Republican debate, is the only candidate to have successfully separated conjoined twins, has gaps in his understanding of science. âÂ  Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has been among the most vocal of the candidates in denouncing Planned Parenthood and advocating a government shutdown over its funding, stands that his supporters see as a âcritical opening,â Politico writes, to âmake a sustained case to Tea Party and evangelical voters that heâs the one candidate doing battle in the trenches for their causes.â âÂ  And, The Des Moines Register reports, âA party bus plastered with leading Republican presidential candidate Mr. Trumpâs name and campaign slogan appeared for sale on the online classified advertising website Craigslist on Monday.â
