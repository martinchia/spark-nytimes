NASHUA, N.H. â Among his varied attacks on Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Donald J. Trump has taken issue with a loan the senator received (and did not properly disclose) from Goldman Sachs in 2012. On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz delivered a rebuttal: Thatâs rich. Arguing that Mr. Trump himself had extensive loans “from giant Wall Street banks,” Mr. Cruz said the criticism from Mr. Trump, “to use a New York term, is the height of chutzpah.” “And Heidi and I did something that is very novel and unfamiliar to Donald,” Mr. Cruz told the crowd at a town hall-style event here. “We paid it back.â The loan has become a headache for Mr. Cruz since a New York Times report last month about his failure to disclose it appropriately during his Senate run. It has also drawn attention to his wife Heidiâs job with the firm, from which she has taken an unpaid leave for the campaign. Mr. Cruz was asked Wednesday if his background represented a âconflict of interestâ for someone whose campaign is premised in part on a populist crusade against cronyism. Mr. Cruz took the opportunity to speak in more detail than usual about his wifeâs business life.  âWhat she does is not involved with the government. She is investing money for families in and around Texas,â Mr. Cruz said. âSheâs essentially a stockbroker.â He said the family took the loan from Goldman in 2012 because of the wealth of his opponent in the Senate race, David Dewhurst. âItâs a good thing I never had to run against a rich guy again,â he joked. A short while later, Mr. Cruz was interrupted by at least a dozen demonstrators, who seemed to be protesting Mr. Cruzâs denial of global warming. “You canât win New Hampshire like you won Iowa!â one shouted.  As they were escorted out, Mr. Cruz paced the stage quietly. âSomeone has invited the children to the event,â he said. âAnd it does seem that these particular children attended the Donald Trump school of debate: If the facts are uncomfortable, simply yell and scream and stomp your feet.â
