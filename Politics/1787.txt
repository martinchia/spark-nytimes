Gov. Chris Christie will be showing his first television ad of the cycle in the same place he spent his first week as a candidate: New Hampshire. The nearly $500,000 ad purchase will run in the Boston and Manchester, N.H., television markets, as well on cable, satellite and digital, over a four-week period. With splices of Mr. Christieâs announcement speech in New Jersey tracking under footage of people working in plants and hugging on doorsteps, the ad further builds on his campaignâs central message: the Republican candidate’s persona. âI am not looking to be the most popular guy, who looks in your eyes everyday and tries to figure out what you want to hear, say it, and then turn around and do something else,â Mr. Christie says in the ad. The ad purchase in New Hampshire is yet another example of Mr. Christie’s campaign staking its 2016 hopes on the Granite State.
