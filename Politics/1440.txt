If elections were won based on Facebook chatter, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Rand Paul would be the front-runners in early primary season states.  The social media company has released figures on how the candidates â and presumed candidates â fared in terms of Facebook interactions in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina from mid-May to mid-June. Interactions represent likes, posts, comments and shares about a candidate. Mrs. Clinton is leading all candidates in the three states, and is generating the most interest in South Carolina, where she has 460,000 interactions from 104,000 people.  Mr. Sanders, the independent from Vermont running for the Democratic nomination, trails Mrs. Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire, but leads all the other Republicans in those states. Mr. Sanders, a socialist who rails against the influence of corporate money in politics, has an enthusiastic cadre of followers on Facebook and Twitter.  Mr. Paul, who has also invested in a sophisticated social media strategy and likes to “troll” his opponents online, comes in third place in Iowa and New Hampshire, after Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders. He is doing even better in South Carolina, where he is in second place.  Former Gov. Jeb Bush, of Florida has some ground to make up on the Facebook front. He ranks fourth in Iowa, fifth in New Hampshire (following Senator Ted Cruz of Texas) and seventh in South Carolina.  The social media dynamics in South Carolina are somewhat different than Iowa and New Hampshire, as Senator Lindsey Graham, who hails from the state, is generating more discussion there and Ben Carson ranks third.  Some White House hopefuls such as Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who has yet to declare, have landed in the middle of the pack despite national polls that label them as “top tier” candidates. But social media chatter is no substitute for formal surveys, as interest in a candidate, such as Donald Trump, can overshadow how seriously voters take them as a potential president.
