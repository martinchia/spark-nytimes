The “super PAC” supporting Carly Fiorina, the lone woman running for the Republican presidential nomination, has put out a web ad ahead of this week’s debate that seeks to turn the tables on Donald J. Trump for appearing to poke fun at her looks. The spot from Carly for America builds off the comment from Mr. Trump to Rolling Stone magazine, when he pointed to Ms. Fiorina on television while a reporter from the magazine was interviewing him and said, “Look at that face!” He went on to say no one would vote for her (and has since denied he was knocking her looks and instead was commenting on her “persona”). The spot doesn’t specifically invoke Mr. Trump. But it uses footage of Ms. Fiorina speaking to a group of women, saying: “Look at this face â and look at all of your faces. The face of leadership.” She suggests that Democrats belittle women as a “special interest group,” then adds, “We are the majority of the nation.” As for her own face, she points out that she is a 61-year-old woman, and adds, “I am proud of every year and every wrinkle.”  By AMY CHOZICK and PATRICK HEALY Political strategists warn male candidates to use caution when debating against a female rival. But it remains to be seen if Mr. Trump will take that approach on Wednesday.
