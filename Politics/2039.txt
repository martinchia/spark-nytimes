Senator Marco Rubio’s economic speech in Chicago on Tuesday criticized the failed Democratic policies of the past and called for the need to unleash American innovation. But when it came to education policy, some of presidential candidate’s proposals had a familiar ring to them. Mr. Rubio, the Republican from Florida, called for overhauling the college accreditation system, creating a pay scale for student loan repayment and expanding investment in vocational training. Many of the details from those ideas sounded strikingly similar to policies that President Obama has called for during his time in office. Mr. Rubio called for creating “a new accreditation process that welcomes low-cost, innovative providers” that would allow new competitors into the education marketplace. In 2013, Mr. Obama proposed establishing “a new, alternative system of accreditation that would provide pathways for higher education models and colleges to receive federal student aid based on performance and results.â On Tuesday, Mr. Rubio proposed a progressive scale for student loan repayments to ease burdens on people who take lower wage jobs when they graduate. “The more they make, the faster they pay back their loans; and the less they make, the less strain their loans cause,” he said. Last summer, Mr. Obama made a similar appeal, devising a “pay as you earn” plan that give Americans who were repaying loans the chance to cap those payments at 10 percent of their incomes. The senator also said that if he is elected president he would expand apprenticeship programs and make vocational training more easily accessible. While the idea came without specifics of how this would be achieved, it did echo a proposal that Mr. Obama put forward at the end of his first term that to ramp up spending on vocational training at the high school and college level. While Mr. Rubio has worked with Democrats on education legislation in the past, not all of his ideas are popular with the opposing party. Critics argue that his plan to create “student investment plans” could make college more expensive for some people, and the suggestion that he might eliminate the Department of Education is likely a non-starter with liberals. Holly Shulman,Â a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, also noted that Mr. RubioÂ blocked a bill that would allow students to refinance their student loans, and opposed the presidentâs plan to make community college debt-free to anyone who works. “Marco Rubio has yet to articulate any new ideas,” Ms.Â Shulman said.
