The exchange is raw, personal and angry: Xavier Cortada, a gay friend of Jeb Bush, then the governor of Florida, sent him an email on March 3, 2004, with a plea. Mr. Cortada, an artist, was alarmed that Mr. Bushâs brother, President George W. Bush, was proposing to amend the Constitution to outlaw same-sex marriage â and was unsettled that the governor backed the idea. âWhen one of us is denied equality, then all of us are denied liberty,â Mr. Cortada wrote to Mr. Bush. âToday, I am feeling particularly denied and particularly unequal.â Could they discuss this further, Mr. Cortada asked? Mr. Bushâs reply is polite and sensitive, but at times clinical and moralistic — he writes of âcontractual obligations.â The governor ultimately seems unmoved by the letterâs demand for equality. âI donât believe that your relationship should be afforded the same status in the law as a man and a woman agreeing to marriage,â he wrote. The letter is one of dozens at the heart of a new e-book by Mr. Bush, titled âReply All,â that goes on sale Tuesday night. It is a memoir of his governorship told through the email exchanges he had with staff members, the news media and residents of Florida. Mr. Bush was known for his devotion to email as governor, giving his address out to the public and spending 25 to 30 hours a week writing and responding to messages. Many are serious. In one email, the brother of Terri Schiavo, the Florida woman whose husband and family feuded over her end of life care, thanked Mr. Bush for intervening to try to keep her alive. Other messages are humorous. Mr. Bush repeatedly employed the emoticon for a smile, concluding one email  “:) :)”  Below is Mr. Bushâs exchange with Mr. Cortada, with an introduction by Mr. Bush: This exchange about same-sex marriage was with a gay friend. I abhor discrimination of any kind. Because of my Catholic faith, I believe marriage is a sacrament best reserved for a man and woman. While I disagree with the decision made by the US Supreme Court, we now need to strike a balance between respecting the religious freedom of the American people and ensuring gay and lesbian families are not discriminated against in our society.  From: Xavier Cortada
Subject: I have some personal insight on gay marriage that I think you will find useful I just received an email (below) forwarding a letter sent by Bette Midler to the president about his support for a Constitutional Amendment to ban gay marriage. I understand you also support the proposed Amendment and ban. The presidentâs rationale (during the State of the Union address) is that âactivistâ judges are usurping the democratic process, but how would todayâs jurists be any different from those in the Brown v. Topeka Board of Education case you mentioned to in your State of the State speech yesterday? Fifty years ago, that âactivistâ Court did not just do right by those school children (who were being treated unequally); but the case was a blessing for the rest of our nation (which was being denied the right to live in a free and open society). When one of us is denied equality, then all of us are denied liberty. Today, I am feeling particularly denied and particularly unequal. My life partner, Juan Carlos, and I have been together for eight years and are being denied rights afforded to others who can legally marry. Worst, I feel suffocated — living in a society where liberty evaporates with every attack on people who happen to be gay â and I see it can only get worse as this debate rages on. The problem is not just the homophobia and violence (remember Matthew Shepard?) that this marginalization generates, but also the image that is generated in society at large: Gays and lesbians as second class citizens. For our beloved Country this would mean that âall are equal, but some are more equal than others.â Nothing can be more threatening to a democracy. When you have a chance, Iâd like to talk to you â and perhaps your brother — about this. Open dialogue is always healthy. Call me â or email me — when you have a chance. From: Jeb Bush Thank you for writing and I apologize for not responding earlier. The tyranny of the present has gotten me! I am sensitive to your point of view but respectfully disagree. If there is discrimination, there are remedies. The cases of violence against gay and lesbians are unconscionable and the laws in Florida exist to bring justice. Your relationship with Juan Carlos can be made more permanent through contractual obligations that set forth asset disposition and other issues. However, I donât believe that your relationship should be afforded the same status in the law as a man and a woman agreeing to marraige. The institution of marraige is under attack in our society and it needs to be strengthened. This does not have to be at the expense of other kinds of relationships but in support of the most important institution in our society. We can discuss this if you like and again, I am expressing my opinion with the respect that you deserve.
