The fast-developing story of Kim Davis, the Kentucky county clerk ordered to jail on Thursday for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, continued to divide the Republican presidential field. Candidates vying for support from social conservatives issued increasingly heated statements of support for Ms. Davis as her case escalated this week.   Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said on Thursday that Ms. Davis jailing was an act of âjudicial tyranny,â and in a statement he called on âevery Believer, every Constitutionalist, every lover of liberty to stand with Kim Davis.” Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky told CNN, “I think it’s absurd to put someone in jail for exercising their religious liberty.”    Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas said on Twitter that he would go to Kentucky on Tuesday to support Ms. Davis. âWe must end the criminalization of Christianity!” he wrote.  Other candidates pumped less aggressively on the religious liberty issue, a cause that has animated some but not all conservatives since the Supreme Court ruled in June that the Constitution guaranteed a right to same-sex marriage. Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, said he had âgreat respectâ for Ms. Davis; he called for passage of federal and state laws to shield people in similar positions.   Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana linked the case of Ms. Davis, who refused to comply with a court order to issue wedding licenses, citing her religious beliefs, to the cases of florists and bakers who have been sued or fined for refusing their services for gay weddings. âI donât think anyone should have to choose between following their conscience and religious beliefs and giving up their job and facing financial sanctions,” Mr. Jindal told The Huffington Post on Wednesday.   At least three candidates, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Carly Fiorina, the former Silicon Valley executive, said that as a government employee Ms. Davis was obligated to carry out the law, despite personal religious objections.  In a radio interview on Tuesday, Mrs. Fiorina, who has been forceful about the rule of law, said, âIs she prepared to continue to work for the government, be paid for by the government, in which case she needs to execute the governmentâs will, or does she feel so strongly about this that she wants to sever her employment with the government and go seek employment elsewhere where her religious liberties would be paramount over her duties as a government employee?â Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin appeared less clear on his position. Asked by the radio host Laura Ingraham on Thursday if Ms. Davis should be compelled to issue marriage licenses, Mr. Walker said:    âItâs a balance that youâve got to have in America between the laws that are out there, but ultimately ensuring the Constitution is upheld. I read that the Constitution is very clear, that people have the freedom of religion. That means you have the freedom to practice your religious beliefs out there.”
