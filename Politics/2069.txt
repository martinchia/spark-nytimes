The so-called undercard debate seems to have officially become the standard for Republican debates this election cycle. Fox Business Network, which will host the fourth Republican debate on Nov. 10, announced Tuesday that the debate in Milwaukee will also feature an undercard of lower-polling candidates, moderated by the network’s Trish Regan and Sandra Smith, as well as Gerald Seib, the Wall Street Journal’s Washington bureau chief. To qualify for the prime-time debate, candidates must score 2.5 percent or higher in an average of the four most recent national polls through Nov. 4, according to the criteria the network released Tuesday. Candidates below the 2.5 percent average in the polls, but hitting at least 1 percent in one of the four most recent national polls through Nov. 4, will be invited to participate in the earlier debate.  Neil Cavuto, the network’s managing editor of business news, and Maria Bartiromo, the network’s global markets editor, will moderate the main debate, along with Gerard Baker, the Wall Street Journal’s editor-in-chief. The Fox Business Network debate comes as the business network just had its highest-rated month ever in October. According to Nielsen, the network averaged 102,000 total viewers this month.
