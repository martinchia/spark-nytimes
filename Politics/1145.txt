Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, chafing at the suggestion that conservative criticisms of Planned Parenthood might have played a role in the attack at a Colorado clinic on Friday, lashed out on Sunday at the âvicious rhetoric on the left, blaming those who are pro-life.â Speaking to reporters in Newton, Iowa, Mr. Cruz said âwe donât fully know the motivations of this deranged individualâ in the shooting, which killed three people and wounded nine. Mr. Cruz added, without prompting, that the suspected gunman, Robert L. Dear Jr., was âregistered to vote as a woman.â He suggested that there was âvery little evidenceâ tying the shooting to anti-abortion sentiment, a cause frequently invoked by Mr. Cruz and his fellow Republicans in the presidential primary.  When a reporter cited news reports that Mr. Dear had said âno more baby partsâ after he was apprehended, Mr. Cruz replied, âWell, itâs also reported that he was registered as an independent and as a woman and a transgender leftist activist.â Aides to Mr. Cruz said he was not saying with certainty that the gunman was a âtransgender leftist activist,â but rather highlighting how little was known about him definitively. âHe was making the point that there isnât enough information,” Rick Tyler, a campaign spokesman, said. âYou canât expect a full response to a story thatâs developing. The point was thereâs a lot of raw information going around thatâs not confirmed.â Asked what news reports Mr. Cruz was referring to, a spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, pointed to a website called therightscoop.com. Its post, titled âWas the Colorado shooter a TRANSGENDER person?!?!,â said there were voting records in which a Robert L. Dear Jr. was identified as female.  Over the weekend, Mr. Cruz was initially one of the few Republican candidates to address the shooting, calling it a tragedy but declining to refer directly to Planned Parenthood.
