Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These areÂ the places, faces and culinary selectionsÂ of 2016âs first proper bus tour. EVENT 18 Time: 10:22 a.m., Jan. 8 Place: Mason City, Iowa (population: 28,078) Site: Praise Community Church, a modest space with clear square windows and a drum set onstage. Mood: Sunday best, with Cruz lapel stickers DVDs available: âBen Hurâ (animated version); âThe Ten Commandmentsâ (animated version); “Left Behind II: Tribulation Force,” starring Kirk Cameron Iowa dining appreciation, via Representative Steve King: âIf you can get it down, itâs good. If you can keep it down, itâs better.â Best prop: âOur whole family unicycles,â Christa Hanson, 21, said, rolling her single wheel through the church. Runner-up: âDid she say Iâm the fastest juggler in the world?â Ms. Hansonâs father, Mark Hanson, asked, clutching five balls. (News clips attest to his prowess.) Highlight: Mr. Cruz, who places faith at the center of his campaign pitch at all stops, took particular care to project a preacherâs cadence in his closing. He asked the crowd to spend one minute a day in prayer until caucus day. âOne minute, lifting our country up in prayer,â he said, his eyes narrowing as the cheers swelled. âFather God, please, keep this awakening going.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
