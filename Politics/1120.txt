NBC viewers in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina should be prepared to see a lot of four Republican presidential candidates over the Thanksgiving weekend. After Donald J. Trump hosted “Saturday Night Live” this month, several of his Republican rivals filed complaints about receiving equal airtime. So NBC has granted the campaigns of Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, Mike Huckabee, James Gilmore and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina their specific equal-airtime requests. This does not mean that a coming “S.N.L.” episode will be hosted by any of the candidates. Nor will there even be a cameo. What it does entail will be the use of commercial and promotional airtime in prime time this weekend, including during “Saturday Night Live,” when a re-run will be broadcast. Still at the negotiating table is George E. Pataki, the former governor of New York, who also filed a complaint requesting equal airtime.  “We continue to negotiate with NBC and remain hopeful we can reach a swift resolution,” said David Catalfamo, a spokesman for the Pataki campaign.
