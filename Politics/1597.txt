A forum that Fox News will hold for Republican presidential candidates excluded from its prime-time debate on Aug. 6 is being moved from early afternoon to 5 p.m. and will be truncated to an hour, officials with the cable network confirmed. The earlier forum, which will be held the same day, was added as something of a consolation prize for the lowest-polling candidates in the field who donâ€™t make the main debate. The criteria for the debate is ranking in the top 10 of an average of national polls. The forum was originally to be 90 minutes, but will now be an hour. But it will also air later than planned, a Fox News spokeswoman confirmed, giving the candidates appearing in it a greater chance of being seen by viewers. The move, which was reported by Politico, is unlikely to quell concerns about who gets left out of the prime-time debate. At the moment, John R. Kasich, the governor of Ohio, where the debate is taking place, would be among those not making the cut based on the polls.
