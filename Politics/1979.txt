With one catchy line, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio has found a way to try to set himself apart from his more combative rivals. âI will not take the low road to the highest office in the land,â he declared after winning his home state’s primary on Tuesday, drawing cheers and applause. That pledge is a staple of his appearances these days, and audiences seem to love it. Last weekend, his campaign posted a video on Twitter showing a standing ovation that it prompted; on Friday, he used a version of the line in the first few minutes of an event in Utah. But if the line sounds familiar, there’s good reason: It is. In the 2000 presidential race, Senator John McCain of Arizona lost what was a famously ugly primary contest in South Carolina, where he faced vicious smears. In his concession speech, he portrayed himself as standing above the ugliness. âI will not take the low road to the highest office in this land,â he said. “I want the presidency in the best way, not the worst way.” Mr. Kasichâs campaign shares a key player from Mr. McCainâs 2000 run: John Weaver, who is the governorâs chief strategist. Asked about Mr. Kasich’s use of the same line, Mr. Weaver said Friday that he had indeed told him about Mr. McCain’s turn of phrase. “I casually mentioned that to the governor when Trump & Cruz (and others) descended into a world of negativity and division,” Mr. Weaver wrote in an email, referring to Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.
