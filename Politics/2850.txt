A “super PAC” supporting Carly Fiorina is defending her record as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard in a full-page ad in The New York Times that promotes her strength as a leader of the technology company. Tom Perkins, the founder of the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and a member of the board that ultimately ousted Ms. Fiorina in 2005, described the Republican presidential candidate as a visionary executive who helped to revive the company during hard times.  “Not only did she save the company from the dire straits it was in, she laid the foundation for HPâs future growth,” Mr. Perkins wrote, pointing to an increase in revenues and patents during her time there.  The endorsement from Mr. Perkins comes a week after The Times’s Andrew Ross Sorkin wrote a column detailing Mrs. Fiorina’s woes at Hewlett-Packard and calling her business record “not so sterling.” Mr. Perkins said that the much maligned merger with Compaq turned out to be a good thing, and that Mrs. Fiorina was the victim of board members â some of whom were family members of the company’s founders â who were protecting their own interests. “While Carly fought to save the company and the employees within, some board members fought for their own power or advancement,” Mr. Perkins wrote. While Mr. Perkins was one of the board members who voted to fire Mrs. Fiorina, he now calls that move a mistake.
