 LEXINGTON, S.C. â Scott Walker worked off little sleep on Wednesday during the first barnstorming trip of his presidential campaign. On a one-day, three-city swing through South Carolina, Mr. Walker tried to sell himself to voters as down-to-earth and easy to relate to by commiserating about commercial flight delays. Mr. Walker, the governor of Wisconsin who entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination on Monday, told a lunchtime crowd here that he had been awake for the last 31 hours because his flight from Las Vegas to Atlanta on Tuesday night had been diverted to Memphis because of bad weather.  When he and his campaign team finally reached Atlanta, he said, they had missed their flight to Charleston, S.C. They opted to rent a van and make the five-hour drive, stopping at a Burger King in the wee hours Wednesday before reaching North Charleston for an 8 a.m. event at a Harley-Davidson dealership. âI tried to sneak in a few zâs, but itâs hard when your head is up against an armrest,â Mr. Walker said in Lexington. The lack of sleep doesn’t seem to have fazed him: Mr. Walker stayed on message during his first two campaign events. He has had a little coffee, aides say, but is drinking plenty of water. His stop at a Lexington barbecue restaurant was the second of Mr. Walkerâs four events on Wednesday, the last of which will be a fund-raiser in Atlanta before boarding a flight to New Hampshire for a couple of campaign stops there on Thursday.
