NEWTON, Iowa â It was not the Iran deal, or her private email server, that a woman at a crowded coffee shop wanted to question Hillary Rodham Clinton about on Sunday. It was mistreatment of puppies. âWhen you become president, this is what I would like you to do,â the woman told the former secretary of state. “I would like to see every single dog and cat mill across the country shut down.â The woman added that anyone who abuses an animal should face felony charges. Mrs. Clinton, a dog lover who owns a curly-haired mutt named Maisie and a toy poodle mix named Tally, offered a minute-long response that was generally sympathetic. âI share your concern about these mills,â Mrs. Clinton responded. âFrom everything I know about them, they really are terrible places for any animal, and particularly for dogs and cats.â She added, âWe do need to do more.â As for animal cruelty, Mrs. Clinton said, âI think for some egregious examples, and there are some, they would rise to a felony.â âNot all of them, perhaps,â she said. âI donât know that we can say that.â The Clinton family has had several beloved pets, including Socks the cat, while in the White House. Former President Bill Clinton was especially attached to Buddy, a chocolate Labrador retriever, but Buddy was hit by a car in Chappaqua, N.Y., where the couple now lives.
