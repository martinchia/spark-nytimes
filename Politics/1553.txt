Hillary Rodham Clinton will present on Tuesday a multipart plan to decrease the cost of prescription medication, as part of a series of campaign events this week devoted to health care policy and how she plans to âbuild on the progressâ made under the Affordable Care Act.  The prescription drug plan, which Mrs. Clinton will outline at a town hall event in Des Moines, includes regulating the percentage of revenues pharmaceutical companies must spend on research and development, instituting a cap on the cost of many out-of-pocket drugs for chronic and serious health conditions, and allocating additional funding to put more generic versions of drugs on the market. On Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton is expected to present a plan to rein in the cost of nonpharmaceutical health care expenses. âAll of the Republican candidates for president are determined to get rid of the Affordable Care Act,â Mrs. Clinton told a crowd in Baton Rouge, La., on Monday. âIâm not going to let them tear up that law, kick 16 million people off health coverage.â But Mrs. Clinton has also consistently said that the health care act, President Obamaâs signature policy achievement, is flawed and that if elected she would work out the kinks. “My attitude is, look, we’ve got some good things done, let’s preserve what works and fix what doesn’t,” she told voters in New Hampshire last week. On Monday, Mrs. Clinton posted a link on Twitter to an article about extreme and sudden jumps in the pricing of drugs. A 62-year-old drug used to treat a life-threatening parasitic infection, for example, went overnight from costing $750 a tablet from $13.50.   âPrice gouging like this in the specialty drug market is outrageous,â Mrs. Clinton wrote. âTomorrow Iâll lay out a plan to take it on.â  That plan includes a monthly cap on the amount insurers could ask people to pay out of pocket for specialty drugs, and increased competition for generic versions of specialty drugs. The plan would also allow Americans to import lower-cost drugs from abroad, within the confines of Food and Drug Administration safety regulations, and prohibit drug companies from keeping generics off the market, which would save an estimated $10 billion, according to her campaign. As in her 2008 campaign, Mrs. Clinton proposes allowing Medicare to negotiate with drug companies to rein in drug costs. The current plan would also require drug companies to provide higher rebates in a Medicare program that provides subsidies to low-income seniors, which her aides estimate would save more than $100 billion in Medicare costs. Health care has long been a priority issue for Mrs. Clinton, who embraced health care reform as first lady with a plan that ultimately failed in a public and crushing defeat. On Monday, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana called Mrs. Clinton âthe godmother of socialized medicine,â a title she seemed to embrace. By PATRICK HEALY and MARGOT SANGER-KATZ The rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination competed fiercely on plans to rein in pharmaceutical companies as Republicans generally opposed interference. Hillary Rodham Clinton said that she would refuse to let Republican lawmakers âstart the health care debate all over againâ by repealing the Affordable Care Act.
