Donald J. Trump has caused a big stir by criticizing Senator John McCain’s war record, but so far his polling strength appears to be intact.  A new survey of likely Republican caucusgoers in Iowa by Monmouth University found that Mr. Trump’s support has been holding steady in the state despite attacks from his rivals. Mr. Trump drew nearly universal backlash from the Republican Party establishment for suggesting that Mr. McCain is not a war hero. In Iowa, however, he retained support of 13 percent of the state’s Republicans. That trails only Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who leads the pack with 22 percent. Ben Carson, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas round out the top five in the poll, which was conducted from Thursday to Sunday.  “Trump has outmaneuvered the rest of the field to earn the second spot despite his controversial statements over the weekend,â  said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute in New Jersey. Mr. Trump often points to his strong performance in national and state polls as evidence of his credibility as a candidate. But the true impact of his comments will likely not be known for several days, as voters fully digest them and assess their significance. The survey found little difference in reaction to Mr. Trump before and after his remarks on Saturday. His support was strong among those who consider themselves members of the Tea Party, voters who are very conservative, and evangelical Christians.  While some skeptics about Mr. Trump’s candidacy point out that his lifestyle and inconsistent views on social issues make him out of step with the party, Monmouth’s poll indicates that social issues appear to be less important among Iowa Republicans this year. Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who have traditionally performed well in Iowa, are failing to gain traction this time around.  Monmouth’s poll of 425 likely Republican voters has a margin of error of 4.5 percent.
