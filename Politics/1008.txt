Donald J. Trump’s surge in the polls shows no signs of abating. The business mogul and Republican presidential candidate is in a statistical tie with former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida in a Suffolk University/USA Today national poll of potential primary voters released on Tuesday. The survey is the latest in a succession of strong showings since Mr. Trump announced his campaign last month and made inflammatory comments about illegal immigrants. Mr. Trump has the support of 17 percent of Republican or independent voters who say they plan to participate in the party’s primary elections or caucuses, while Mr. Bush has 14 percent; the difference is within the survey’s margin of error. âTrump is making daily headlines in advance of the primary season,â said David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center in Boston. âThis has vaulted him to the top of the pack on the backs of conservative voters.” Besides Mr. Trump and Mr. Bush, the top tier of Republican candidates in the poll includes Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. The same polling outfit showed Mr. Bush with a small lead over Mr. Trump in New Hampshire in June. The two Republicans have been sparring verbally in recent weeks and have remained virtually deadlocked in recent voter surveys.  Republicans who are worried about Mr. Trump’s ascent argue that it is still early in the race and that his poll numbers are driven by his name recognition. According to the Suffolk University poll, 30 percent of Republican voters are undecided about who they will support. Mr. Trump has said that he would be the strongest Republican to take on Hillary Rodham Clinton in a general election and suggested that she was afraid to face him. However, the Suffolk poll shows her beating him handily head to head, 51 percent to 34 percent.
