With most political eyes on Iowa right now, and most Iowa eyes on the Rose Bowl â where their beloved Hawkeyes are taking on Stanford on New Year’s Day â the “super PAC” supporting Jeb Bush is heading to Pasadena, Calif., where the big game will be held. The group, Right to Rise, set up a tent Thursday at an Iowa pep rally on the U.S.S. Iowa, and created its own Snapchat filter â “Hawkeyes for Jeb,” in gold letters, naturally.  On Friday, the group will serve mobile ads to the mobile and tablet devices of people they have identified as Iowa residents  within a 50-mile radius of the Rose Bowl. And they will join in the fun with another tent and tailgate, complete with goodies promoting Mr. Bush. The message: Go Hawkeyes! But really, go Jeb! https://www.twitter.com/_Charette_/status/682665744568463360 Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
