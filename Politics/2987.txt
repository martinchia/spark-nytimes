Jeb Bush got the âslow jamâ treatment from Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show” on Tuesday night, and he reiterated in rhyme that he was finally ready to hit the campaign trail and have âspirited debatesâ with his fellow Republicans about how to solve Americaâs problems. It was Mr. Fallonâs first slow jam rendition since his duet with Brian Williams in December, and the comedian did manage to slip in one hardball question. âWhile weâre talking about the issues, where do you stand on immigration?â Mr. Fallon, host of the “Tonight Show,” asked. Mr. Bush, the former Florida governor, faced the same question from protesters at his campaign announcement rally on Monday, and he was prepared with an answer. âWe are a nation of immigrants, and I believe everyone should have the chance to achieve the American dream,â Mr. Bush said over the music, before offering the Spanish translation. âSomos una naciÃ³n de inmigrantes, y creo que todo el mundo deberÃ­a tener la oportunidad de alcanzar el sueÃ±o americano.â
