The 16 Republican presidential hopefuls are competing against one another to score a coveted spot onstage for the first Republican debate next month. But on the Sunday shows, the chatter was all focused on the new developments surrounding Hillary Rodham Clinton’s emails. Calling into CNN’s “State of the Union,” Donald Trump went the furthest, saying that Mrs. Clinton’s behavior was “criminal.” “What she has done is criminal,” he said. “I don’t see how she can run, because, if the prosecutors â they’re all Democrats, so they’re protecting her. But if you had an impartial prosecutor and they were honorable â we’re going to find out â but what she’s done is criminal.” Two State Department inspectors general said last week they had found classified information on Mrs. Clinton’s private email account that she used during her time as secretary of state. The Clinton campaign has long maintained that her private email server contained no classified information, and it responded on Friday by saying that any classified information on her server had been classified after the fact. On “Fox News Sunday,” Carly Fiorina said that “it’s absolutely crystal clear she broke the rules” and has been “engaged in a cover-up of lots of things.” “I mean, how amazing that she’s had this server in her basement all this time and decides to wipe it clean two years after she leaves the State Department and just before she gets ready to run for president,” she said.  Ms. Fiorina also said that the latest controversy will hurt Mrs. Clinton with voters by adding to their impression of her as someone they cannot trust. “We know voters care about whether a potential president is trustworthy,” she said. “And what voters are discovering, day after day, drip by drip, is that Hillary Clinton is not trustworthy. It is the heart of the matter. She’s not trustworthy. She has engaged in cover-ups and she’s not been truthful.”  On CBS’s “Face The Nation,” Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky also hammered Mrs. Clinton over the trust theme. “She doesn’t obey the rules, but then she says, ‘Oh, trust me, I didn’t have any classified information, and trust me, I’ve given you all the emails,'” Mr. Paul said. “It’s a little bit hard to have trust in Hillary Clinton when she breaks every rule along the way, and then we’re supposed to trust her to give us all of her email?  I think this is a real problem for Hillary Clinton, and this isn’t going away.” He also said Mrs. Clinton’s latest problem with her email reflected a pattern of behavior from Mrs. Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. “They did this because they’re Clintons,” Mr. Paul said. “And the Clintons think they live above the law, and they think they can live differently than all the rest of America.  And I think this is going to come back to bite her and already is.”
