EVENT 13 Time: 8:31 p.m., Jan. 6 Place: Storm Lake, Iowa (population: 10,600) Site: Kingâs Pointe Waterpark Resort, in a lobby with a burning fireplace and a Christmas tree Mood: politically active ski lodge Best-dressed: Greg Stone, 46, a hotel guest who attended the event without shoes. âOnly way to go,â he said, wiggling his toes. Steps taken by Mr. Cruz as of 9:35 p.m.: 12,697, he told reporters, checking his Fitbit Highlight: Mr. Cruz called on a woman, Ofelia Valdez, who said she had come to the country from Mexico as an undocumented teenager. Ms. Valdez has been able to stay under a federal work permit program, which Mr. Cruz opposes, for certain immigrants who arrived in their youth. She wondered about her fate in a Cruz presidency. âWe are a country of immigrants,â Mr. Cruz said, âbut it matters if you follow the rules.â “I consider myself as a part of the community,â Ms. Valdez said.  Being part of the federal program âmeans that you were brought here illegally,â Mr. Cruz replied calmly. âAnd violating the laws has consequences.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
