The outside groups backing the Republican candidates for president have raised tens of millions of dollars, and they’ve already begun spending them, buying millions of dollars worth of early advertising to highlight their candidates’ records. But instead of concentrating in major markets in places like Des Moines or Manchester, N.H. — states where the first votes will be cast for the party’s nomination — some of the groups are focusing their ad-buying firepower on the national cable audience. One possible reason: Unless candidates can raise their name identification and popularity in national polls, they won’t make the cut for the first Republican debate, scheduled for Aug. 6. “Weâve made the decision to spend some serious money to reach a more national audience to introduce the governor, because we want to see him on that debate stage,” said Austin Barbour, adviser to a group of “super PACs” backing former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas.  The super PACs, known as Opportunity and Freedom, are investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in advertising on the Fox News Channel and other cable channels to raise Mr. Perry’s profile. “Weâve always sort of viewed his announcement though the debate as a phase one,” Mr. Barbour said. “We want to do everything we can do to begin the reintroduction to voters in Iowa, particularly, but also help him qualify for the first debate.” Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
