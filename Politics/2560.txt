Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has made taking the high road a hallmark of his presidential campaign so far, vowing not to get into fights with other Republicans. Apparently Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is not covered by that policy. Mr. Cruz’s animus was unleashed on Friday because Mr. McConnell allowed a vote to move forward on the federal Export-Import Bank, which Mr. Cruz opposes. Here are few of Mr. Cruz’s recent promises of intra-party civility: “I understand that our friends in the media love to see Republicans shoot each other. That makes for good newsprint when it gets nasty and personal, but I have no intention of going there,” Mr. Cruz said in speaking to The Daily Caller in May about being nice to his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination. “I’m not gonna engage in the media’s game of throwing rocks and attacking other Republicans. I’m just not gonna do it,” Mr. Cruz said on July 6, speaking about Donald J. Trump’s remarks on immigration. “To the best of my knowledge, in my time in the Senate, I have not spoken ill of any of my colleagues, Republicans or Democrats. When others attack me, for whatever reason thatâs happened once or twice, my response consistently is to respond with praise. To take the high road,” Mr. Cruz said at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa on July 18. But on Friday, Mr. Cruz took a different approach: “Well, we now know that when the majority leader looks us in the eyes and makes an explicit commitment that he is willing to say things that he knows are false,” Mr. Cruz said on the Senate floor in a speech in which he accusedÂ Mr. McConnell of telling a “flat-out lie” and compared him to Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, the former majority leader loathed by many Republicans.
