FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. â Hillary Rodham Clinton issued a pointed broadside against Jeb Bush on Friday, suggesting his positions as a presidential candidate and his actions as governor of Florida had set back the cause of black Americans. Mrs. Clinton mocked Mr. Bush’s favored slogan, “Right to Rise “ â his shorthand for a conservative-minded approach to creating opportunity and name of his “super PAC” â in a speech to a largely black audience at the annual convention of the National Urban League. It was a striking jab given that Mr. Bush is scheduled to take the same stage later on Friday. “I donât think you can credibly say that everyone has a right to rise and say you are for phasing out Medicare. Or for repealing Obamacare. People canât rise if they canât afford health care,” Mrs. Clinton said to applause. Mr. Bush has said that he is not calling for the phasing out of Medicare. But he recently answered a question from a voter that suggested as much. “We need to figure out a way to phase out this program for others and move to a new system that allows them to have something, because they’re not going to have anything,” Mr. Bush said.  In Fort Lauderdale, Mrs. Clinton singled out Mr. Bush’s longtime skepticism over a federal minimum wage and his policies as Florida governor to end affirmative action in college admissions.  Americans, she said, “can’t rise if the minimum wage is too low to live on.” She continued: “They canât rise if their governor makes it harder for them to get a college education. And you cannot seriously talk about the right to rise and support laws that deny the right to vote.â A spokesman for Mr. Bush, Tim Miller, responded with a message on Twitter, expressing disappointment that Mrs. Clinton had used her speech to attack Clintonesque move to pass over chance to unite in favor of a false cheap shot. When you have no record of accomplishment to point to…. — Tim Miller (@Timodc) July 31, 2015  “Clintonesque move to pass over chance to unite in favor of a false cheap shot,” Mr. Miller wrote.  Suggesting a motive for the criticism of Mr. Bush, he said that she has “no record of accomplishment to point to.” A Bush spokeswoman, Allie Brandenburger, called Mrs. Clinton’s speech “just more false, cheap political shots.” Ms. Brandenburger wrote in an email: “The Urban League deserved better today. Governor Bush is running on his record in Florida of expanding opportunity and growing the economy for everyone. Under his leadership, Florida added 1.3 million net new jobs; annual growth was 4.4 percent; household income went up and the state became a national leader in closing the achievement gap. Governor Bush can restore the right to rise for more Americans because he did it in Florida.”  Jeb Bush, a Republican presidential candidate, and Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Democratic candidate, both appeared at the National Urban League conference on Friday to discuss race and opportunity in America. By MICHAEL BARBARO As Mr. Bush waited to speak before the National Urban League, Mrs. Clinton portrayed him as a hypocrite who had set back the cause of black Americans.   Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
