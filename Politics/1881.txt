House Republicans on Wednesday rolled out their “New American Congress” agenda in their first news conference of the year, but questions surrounding Representative Steve Scalise, the third-ranking leader in the chamber, continued to dominate the political discussion. After Speaker John A. Boehner and other party leaders laid out the Republican priorities, the first question that the leaders faced was about Mr. Scalise’s 2002 speech to a group of white supremacists. Asked whether he in fact had said that he was “David Duke without the baggage,” Mr. Scalise responded, “I reject bigotry of all forms, and I think when you see the people that know me best, here and especially back home, people that I’ve been on opposite ends politically with, who know the truth and know my heart, they are the ones who speak the best.” Cutting off follow-up questions, Mr. Scalise referred reporters to his previous statement on the matter and said, “I think that’s where the story ends.” Earlier this week, the White House said it was up to Republicans to decide whether Mr. Scalise should retain his leadership role, but noted Mr. Scalise’s earlier comments about Mr. Duke and said that the party’s choice of leaders reflected its priorities. Mr. Boehner also defended Mr. Scalise, recalling that when he was a state legislator, he had few staff members helping him to vet the groups that he met with.  “He’s a decent, honest person who made a mistake,” Mr. Boehner said. “We all make mistakes.”
