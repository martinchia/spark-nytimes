Republican presidential candidates and members of Congress did not hold back their anger over the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran on Tuesday. With one exception. Senator Rand Paul, the White House hopeful from Kentucky who has supported negotiations with Iran, was silent on the historic development for most of the day on Tuesday before explaining on Twitter why he opposed it. The deal is bad because 1) sanctions relief precedes evidence of compliance
2) Iran is left with significant nuclear capacity 2/2 — Dr. Rand Paul (@RandPaul) July 14, 2015  Foreign policy is one area where Mr. Paul tends to break with many of his fellow Republcans, and he has been criticized within the party for being weak on national security.  When Mr. Paul announced his campaign in April, he faced an attack advertisement tying his Iran policy to that of President Obama’s. He demanded that the ad be taken down and underscored that he was against Mr. Obama’s striking a nuclear pact without congressional approval.  Mr. Paul said that he planned to vote against the agreement as it stands. However, he did not appear to close the door on further negotiations with Iran. “Better to keep the interim agreement in place instead of accepting a bad deal,” Mr. Paul said.
