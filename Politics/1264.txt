They are the “first in the nation” states, but for how long? Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has suggested that Iowa and New Hampshire, which traditionally kick off the nominating season during presidential elections, have no official claim to that status after 2016. In an interview with National Journal, Mr. Priebus called the established order of primaries and caucuses a “hot topic.” “These early states are very used to fighting this out every four years,” Mr. Priebus said. “Itâs just something I think we ought to look at as a party. If you look at my hisÂ­tory, Iâve been very supÂ­portÂ­ive of the early states as genÂ­erÂ­al counÂ­sel and as chairÂ­man. But I donât think anyÂ­one should get too comÂ­fortÂ­able.â Although the party has worked to protect Iowa and New Hampshire from being overtaken by other states, Mr. Priebus went on to predictÂ that things could change. âI donât think there should ever be any sacÂ­red cows as to the primary proÂ­cess or the orÂ­der,â he said. Critics of the nominating process argue that Iowa and New Hampshire have gained undue influence in the party contests, forcing candidates to spend an inordinate amount of time there in hopes of gaining crucial momentum. The dynamic is intended to give candidates who lack financing or name recognition an opportunity to emerge by way of retail politics, but candidates have been increasingly looking for new ways to reach voters and “super PACs” pump money into national advertising. The downfall of the Iowa Straw Poll this year was an early indication that the state’s prominence could be eroding, and Republican leaders there have openly groused about the lack of attention they have received from high-profile candidates such as former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. Mr. Priebus said that he anticipated any changes in future election cycles would look to regionalize or nationalize the process rather than focus on individual states.
