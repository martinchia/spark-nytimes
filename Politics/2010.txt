Former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas made clear on Thursday that his passion for the military will be front and center during his second bid for the White House. Standing to his right as he announced his presidential campaign was Marcus Luttrell, a retired member of the Navy SEALs who was the only survivor of a 2005 attack by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Mr. Luttrell wrote a book about his experiences, “Lone Survivor,” that was later turned into a movie. To Mr. Perry, Mr. Luttrell is more than a military veteran and best-selling author. He is a practically a member of the Perry family “He is not just the lone survivor — to Anita and me, he is a second son,” Mr. Perry said on Thursday, referring to his wife. Mr. Luttrell was in physical therapy in San Diego in 2006 when he met the Perrys, who were there on vacation. They reconnected in Texas, where Mr. Luttrell is from, and Mr. Perry took Mr. Luttrell in while he was dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder. “When I came into the Perry family, it was just kind of one of those deals where they were the only family I had,” Mr. Luttrell said in a speech. Mr. Perry is the godfather of Mr. Luttrell’s children, and Mr. Luttrell campaigned with Mr. Perry in the former governor’s 2012 presidential run. Ready to keep fighting for Mr. Perry, Mr. Luttrell plans to campaign with him in New Hampshire this weekend. Correction: A picture with this article was published in error. It showed Morgan Luttrell, not his twin brother, Marcus, standing next to Rick Perry.
