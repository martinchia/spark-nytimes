After months of mulling an independent run for president, Jim Webb is putting his White House hopes to rest.  Mr. Webb, a former Virginia senator who dropped out of the race for the Democratic nomination in October, said Thursday that mounting a third-party bid would be too heavy a lift. Ultimately, he said, it came down to a lack of money. “We looked at the possibility of an independent candidacy,” Mr. Webb said in a speech to the World Affairs Council in Dallas. “Theoretically it could be done, but it is enormously costly and time sensitive, and I donât see the fund-raising trajectory where we could make a realistic run.â Mr. Webb, a military veteran and a former Republican, ended his campaign last year after drawing paltry fund-raising and poll numbers. He said at the time that he was disillusioned with the direction of the Democratic Party and that he would research whether there was sufficient support for him to embark upon a new effort as an independent.  Third-party presidential runs are notoriously onerous and expensive, and Mr. Webb was potentially facing competition. Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, is considering his own third-party bid — a move that would leave little room for Mr. Webb. As he stepped aside on Thursday, Mr. Webb expressed disappointment at the state of American politics.  “I see no one running for president today who has a firm understanding of the elements necessary to build a national strategy,” he said.
