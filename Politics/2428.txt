SALEM, N.H. â Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina showed his dual roles on the campaign trail Sunday morning: part Jeb Bush surrogate, part warm-up comedian. Mr. Graham took the microphone at a rally for Mr. Bush here, delivering line after line and receiving more laughter than applause. Mr. Bush, still chuckling as he took the microphone from Mr. Graham, noted that âhe’s got a career after politics.â Some of Mr. Grahamâs more well-received lines: On middle school: âIt was the best eight years of my life.â On South Carolina: âCome back, spend money.â On Saturday nightâs debate: âDo yâall wanna hear what I thought about the debate? If you donât, you better leave.â On Gov. Chris Christie: âI never want to make Chris Christie mad.â On Ben Carson and Senator Ted Cruz: âI never believed anybody could make Ben Carson mad. That says a lot about Ted Cruz. Thereâs like 40 people running for president. Isnât it odd that only Ted thought Ben was getting out?â On Donald J. Trump: âWhat did I learn? That if youâre a senior citizen and you own a house in Atlantic City, Donald is not your friend.â On Senator Marco Rubio: âI learned that Marco has a good memory because he kept saying the same thing over and over again.â And finally, on himself and his failed presidential bid: âI got out because I ran out of money. If you want to get money out of politics, you should have joined my campaign.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
