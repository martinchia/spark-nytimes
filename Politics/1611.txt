WARSAW — Jeb Bush on Thursday defended a passage in a 1995 book he co-authored calling for the restoration of shame as a way to curb out-of-wedlock births in the United States. Single parenthood, he said, “hurts the prospects, limits the possibilities of young people being able to live lives of purpose and meaning.â In the book, “Profiles in Character,” it said that “one of the reasons more young women are giving birth out of wedlock and more young men are walking away from their paternal obligations is that there is no longer a stigma attached to this behavior, no reason to feel shame.” It added, “Shame is one of the great regulators of conduct.” Asked about the passage on Thursday during a news conference in Poland, Mr. Bush said his stances have evolved since 1995 but that “my views about the importance of dads being involved in the lives of their children havenât changed at all.” The problem, said the Republican former Florida governor, has grown worse, not better. “The country has moved in the wrong direction â the 40-plus percent out-of-wedlock birthrate and you think about this from the perspective of children, it puts a huge, itâs a huge challenge for single moms to raise children in the world that weâre in today.”     In his remarks on Thursday, Mr. Bush said the original passage he wrote referred primarily to shaming fathers, though that is not clear from the wording in the book. Democrats quickly assailed his views, then and now. “Jeb Bush today confirmed what we already knew: that these out-of-touch beliefs that advocate shame are part of his policy platform,” said Holly Shulman, national press secretary for the Democratic National Committee. âShame on you, Jeb,â she added. Mr. Bush is not alone in using pointed language — and the concept of shame — to encourage two-parent households. Democratic leaders, including President Obama, have done the same.  “We need fathers to realize that responsibility does not end at conception,” Mr. Obama said as a candidate in 2008. âToo many fathers are M.I.A., too many fathers are AWOL, missing from too many lives and too many homes,â Mr. Obama said at the time. âThey have abandoned their responsibilities, acting like boys instead of men. And the foundations of our families are weaker because of it.â Follow the New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.
