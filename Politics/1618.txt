DECORAH, Iowa â Hillary Clinton is sometimes asked what kind of people she would want to put on the Supreme Court â but not who. During a campaign event here in northeast Iowa on Tuesday, one attendee had a nominee in mind: President Obama. Would she name him? Laughing with apparent delight as the audience cheered, Mrs. Clinton said: âWow, what a great idea. Nobody has ever suggested that to me. Wow. I love that.â She then repeated âwowâ again, as if giving herself an extra second to think of a good answer, considering that she has been praising Mr. Obamaâs agenda and leadership repeatedly on the campaign trail recently. âHe may have a few other things to do, but I tell you, thatâs a great idea,â Mrs. Clinton said — not quite committing but certainly not dismissing the notion.  She then turned to the current court, saying that âwe need new justices who actually understand the challenges we faceâ and wondering if some justices made decisions based on ânaÃ¯vetÃ©.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
