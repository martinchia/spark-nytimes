Another arm of Donald J. Trump‘s business empire is suffering repercussions from his presidential run: his fashion line. Macy’s, the department store chain, is ending its relationship with Mr. Trump and phasing out his line of suits, shirts and ties after remarks he made about Mexican immigrants. During his presidential announcement earlier this month he called them “killers” and “rapists” while discussing the need for tougher border control. “We do not believe the disparaging characterizations portray an accurate picture of the many Mexicans, Mexican Americans and Latinos who have made so many valuable contributions to the success of our nation,” Macy’s said in a statement. “In light of statements made by Donald Trump, which are inconsistent with Macyâs values, we have decided to discontinue our business relationship with Mr. Trump and will phase-out the Trump menswear collection, which has been sold at Macyâs since 2004.â The backlash comes as Mr. Trump has performed well in early polls in Iowa and New Hampshire but is increasingly seeing his business interests under pressure now that his policy views are in the spotlight. The move comes after a MoveOn.org petition that garnered more than 700,000 signatures calling for Macy’s to cut ties with Mr. Trump. The decision comes as Macy’s has made a big push to court Hispanic shoppers, launching a new line of apparel, shoes and jewelry earlier this year with ThalÃ­a Sodi, a Mexican pop star. It is one of major retailers, like Kmart, which have been showering attention on the countryâs fast-growing Hispanic population. A report published by Nielsen in March estimated that multicultural consumers spend upwards of $3.4 trillion a year, and make up the fasting growing segment of the consumer economy. The decision by Macy’s is the latest financial setback for Mr. Trump since he announced his candidacy for president. Univision, the Spanish language network, already decided to end its relationship with him, canceling plans to air his Miss USA pageant in July, and NBC Universal followed suit this week after a Change.org petition pressured the network. Mr. Trump has threatened to sue the networks for breach of contract. Pageant participants have also protested Mr. Trump’s remarks, which he has continued to stand by. Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that the breakup was his decision and was made because of pressure that Macyâs was facing from outside groups. He called his relationship with the retailer small in terms of dollar volume and insignificant in comparison to his beliefs on immigration. âI have always said that if you are successful, it is very hard to run for office, especially the office of president,â Mr. Trump said. âI have also continually stated that I am not beholden to anyone and this includes NBC and Macyâs.â For all of those who want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, boycott @Macys. They are weak on border security & stopping illegal immigration. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 1, 2015  A defiant Mr. Trump also accused the companies of supporting illegal immigration and said he was never happy about the fact that the clothing the company sold bearing his name was made in China. âShould I start a new product line somewhere in the future, I would insist that they are made in America,â he said.
