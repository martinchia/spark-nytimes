Good Monday morning from Washington, where a new embassy is opening and where President Obama and his team continue to try to make their case on the Iran nuclear deal. On the trail, however, Donald J. Trump continues to gather the acclaim of his supporters and the condemnation of just about everyone else. The Republican Party will begin another week facing questions about Mr. Trump, the bellicose real estate developer who on Saturday questioned the heroics of Senator John McCain, a former prisoner of war. The condemnation from most Republicans was swift â but it remains to be seen whether the party’s base will share their perspective. Mr. Trump sought to clarify his comments, made at a Republican conference in Iowa, almost immediately after making them, but he said on Sunday that he would not apologize for saying that Mr. McCain is âa war hero because he was captured; I like people who werenât captured.â Top contenders, including Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, said Mr. Trump had discredited himself as a prospective commander in chief. The Republican national chairman Reince Priebus denounced the remarks, and the party’s professed revulsion was broad. But it was not unanimous: Both Mike Huckabee and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas declined to directly criticize Mr. Trump’s comments, and on Twitter, an imprecise metric, several self-described conservative users cheered Mr. Trump on. Mr. McCain, the Republican presidential candidate in 2008, is a deeply respected figure in the establishment, but the conservative base has always viewed him with skepticism, in part over his support for comprehensive immigration overhaul. That Mr. Obama beat Mr. McCain that year has not helped his standing with the far right. Frank Luntz, the pollster who asked Mr. Trump about Mr. McCain’s military service, predicted protests from veterans’ groups this week. Such a movement could force down Mr. Trump’s polling numbers. Still, Mr. Trump, who is a celebrity candidate, is “touching a powerful chord” in an electorate that doesn’t trust its elected officials, Mr. Luntz said. That makes predictions about what happens after this weekend difficult to gauge. â Maggie Haberman Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. As part of the effort to sell the Iran deal, Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter will travel this week to Israel to discuss existing security arrangements. And President Obama is scheduled to meet on Monday with President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria over possibly expanding their countries’ military cooperation in the fight against the Boko Haram terrorist group.Mr. Obama also will travel to New York on Tuesday to tape his final appearance on “The Daily Show” before Jon Stewart steps down. On Wednesday, Mr. Obama will press for the renewal of the Export-Import Bank, and on Thursday, he will leave for Kenya. As Republican presidential candidates flocked to Iowa over the weekend to court the stateâs social conservatives, there was one big name that was not in attendance: Jeb Bush. Mr. Bush, who has been accused by some Iowa Republicans of neglecting the state, declined to make the trip to this yearâs Family Leadership Summit, where much of the rest of the sprawling field discussed immigration, faith and Iran, and where Mr. Trump made his comments about Mr. McCain. A press officer for Mr. Bush did not respond when asked how Mr. Bush spent his Saturday. Despite his absence, Mr. Bush did not appear to be missed by many. âAs far as Iâm concerned, weâve had enough Bushes,â said Chuck Greiner, of Nevada, Iowa. âWe donât need another Bush.â Rose Kendall, of Burlington, said that Mr. Bushâs embrace of Common Core education standards had turned her off and that she was happy he skipped the event. âI donât want him here,â said Ms. Kendall, a Tea Party activist. âI wonât vote if heâs the one they pick.â Many attendees at the conservative event said they thought Mr. Bush was also too progressive on issues like immigration and that he seemed to have little time for their state. âHe may not be that well received in Iowa,â said John Patterson, of Cedar Falls. âHe doesnât really travel to these little locations because he has the big money to back him.â â Alan Rappeport   Tuesday is the fifth birthday of the Wall Street and banking regulation law passed after the 2008 financial collapse, and the two former Democratic lawmakers it is named for are on a bit of a road show to honor the occasion. Former Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and former Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts will be making appearances to discuss the state of the legislation, including at a forum on Monday afternoon at the Newseum, with a keynote address by Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew. Mr. Dodd and Mr. Frank, who have been staunch defenders of the legislation, are also set to gather on Monday with staff at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the agency created by the law to try handle fraud and other complaints. Not everyone is celebrating the anniversary. Republicans critical of the law have been using the occasion to call for the end of Dodd-Frank â the law, not the people. â Carl Hulse Hillary Rodham Clinton rarely talks publicly about her father, Hugh E. Rodham, who exerted a powerful, if sometimes bruising, influence on her life before he died in 1993. As Pope Francis has forcefully staked out ideological ground opposite that of the Republican Party, preparations for his visit in September come with tensions. Politico takes a look at two races, as Carly Fiorina is in danger of falling short of debate parameters, and evangelicals in Iowa are having trouble deciding on their favored candidate. Mrs. Clinton‘s political director, Amanda Renteria, whose parents immigrated from Mexico and who lost a race for Congress last year in California, is seeking, The Los Angeles Times reports, to put into effect the lessons she learned in her loss: “The race in the heavily Latino district exposed blind spots in Democratic strategy with Latino voters.” Mrs. Clinton plans to propose raising the capital gains tax on some short-term gains in a speech later this week, The Wall Street Journal reports. Monday will signal the official resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba, an occasion Mr. Obama announced this month in a formal Rose Garden ceremony as the start of a ânew chapter.â The Cubans plan an elaborate ceremony at their newly transformed embassy on 16th Street, where they have repaved the driveway, painted the fence and installed a new flagpole in recent weeks, in anticipation of hoisting the Cuban flag on Monday morning. Bruno RodrÃ­guez Parrilla, the Cuban foreign minister, will make remarks, and will later hold a meeting with Secretary of State John Kerry at the State Department, where the two will hold a joint news conference. But for an administration that has trumpeted the opening with Cuba as a signature foreign policy achievement, the United States is taking a studiously understated approach to the day. A Cuban flag will be installed in the lobby of the State Department alongside those of the other nations with which the United States has diplomatic ties, but officials said that would occur âoutside of business hours,â declining to say precisely when and making clear that there would be no accommodations for news media access. In other words, good luck getting pictures or video. And while the United States outpost in Havana will become an embassy on Monday, there will be no flag-raising or even a changing over of signs until Mr. Kerry travels there this summer, State Department officials said. âThere is no legal requirement to fly a flag,â said an official who briefed reporters, speaking on the condition of anonymity to detail the nonevents. “We are going to function as an embassy, they will do everything just like an embassy, but they will not have the additional feature of flying the flag.” â Julie Hirschfeld Davis Friday’s newsletter misspelled the surname of a conservative pollster who was to ask candidates a series of questions at the Family Leadership Summit on Saturday. He is Frank Luntz, not Lutz. Like the Politics Newsletter? Get it delivered to your inbox.
