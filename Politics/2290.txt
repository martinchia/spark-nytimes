Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016âs first proper bus tour. EVENT 27 Time: 6:13 p.m., Jan. 9 Place: New Hampton, Iowa (population: 3,571) Site: Big Edâs Firehouse, a theme restaurant with helmets, an ax and a collection of shirts from nearby fire departments Mood: controlled flame Food: wings, including brush fire, barn burner and stop, drop and roll T-shirt: âI Survived Spontaneous Combustion at Big Edâsâ Price: âYou have to earn it,â the establishmentâs owner, Brian Laures, said. (The âspontaneous combustionâ is a platter of hot wings.) Geography quiz: âNew Hampton, right?â asked Bob Vander Plaats, a religious leader who has traveled all week with Mr. Cruz. âWe really donât know where weâre at anymore.â Heidi Cruz on her husband: âGreat at games,â âbig movie buff,â âcan remember anything,â âsteady and calm and low-keyâ Highlight: While many of Mr. Cruzâs one-liners have figured in his stump speech for months, he has had particular success this week with a new one. âI want to ask everyone here to vote for me,â he told the crowd, pausing for the reveal, â10 times.â (Shouts of âHillary!â or âChicago!â invariably follow.) âNow, look, weâre not Democrats,â Mr. Cruz continued, to chuckles. âIâm not suggesting voter fraud.â Rather, he would like supporters to recruit nine friends or relatives to vote for him, too. âThat,â he said, âis how we win.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
