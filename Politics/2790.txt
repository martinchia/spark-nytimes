The Republican establishment is finally having its moment. Up to this point, no one has had a rougher 2016 than the partyâs ostensible chieftains: Its top strategists and donors have been thwarted at the ballot box, and Donald J. Trump has turned Republican congressional leaders into a punch line on the stump. But that has changed in the last few days, as Mr. Trump has struggled to make peace with Republicans in Washington â and Hillary Clinton has made an aggressive bid to win over party elders aghast at Mr. Trumpâs emergence as the presumptive Republican nominee. Suddenly, these dreaded insiders are the most sought-after people in politics. Mr. Trump is headed to Washington on Thursday to huddle with Paul D. Ryan, the speaker of the House, who announced last week that he was not prepared to back Mr. Trump for president. It could take a command performance on Capitol Hill for Mr. Trump to turn around his listing candidacy, at least with the elite groups that have rounded on him since last week. His impatience in demanding their support has irked them only further: Mr. Trump huffed at a campaign stop over the weekend that Mr. Ryan was being âcuteâ about his endorsement. But a senior aide to Mr. Trump, Paul J. Manafort, said on Fox News that the campaign took the need for party unity seriously. (âTrump understands this,â he said.) Mr. Trump is facing serious competitive pressure from outside the party: Mrs. Clinton, implicitly turning the page on her primary against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has begun casting her campaign as a safe haven for anti-Trump Republicans. She told CBS over the weekend that she saw her campaign welcoming non-Democrats who had ârespect for the officeâ of the presidency and âdeep concernâ about Mr. Trumpâs capacity to hold the job. And the voters will get to weigh in again, too, this week: Mr. Sanders is seen as having an upper hand in the West Virginia primary, and it is worth watching whether any significant protest vote shows up against Mr. Trump there or in Nebraskaâs now-ornamental Republican primary election.
