Senator Marco Rubio hit back at Hillary Rodham Clinton on Friday for comparing Republicans to terrorists when it comes to their views on women.  “She’s desperate,” Mr. Rubio, a Republican from Florida, told Fox News. “Her campaign is in bad shape.” During a campaign rally in Ohio on Thursday, Mrs. Clinton singled out Mr. Rubio along with former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio as having “extreme” views on abortion that are out of touch with people who want to live in the modern world.  “We expect that from some of the terrorist groups,â Mrs. Clinton said, mentioning Mr. Rubio’s position that abortion is wrong even in cases of rape or incest. “But itâs a little hard to take coming from Republicans who want to be the president of the United States.â Republicans argued that Mrs. Clinton’s remarks were out of line and that she was trying to distract from the email controversy that continues to swirl around her campaign. On Friday, Mr. Rubio said that it is Mrs. Clinton who holds radical views. Calling her incompetent and deceitful, he suggested that Mrs. Clinton is pressing because she could soon face criminal charges for her handling of emails as secretary of state. âHereâs whatâs most offensive about it: They wonât call terrorists terrorists, going all the way back to Benghazi and before that, but they call political opponents terrorists,” Mr. Rubio said.
