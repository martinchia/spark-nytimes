Jeb Bushâs campaign said Monday that it was reserving millions of dollars in television ad time for January and February in early voting states, setting aside $4.6 million in New Hampshire alone. The campaign was also placing $1 million in ads in Iowa and $2.2 million in South Carolina. The totals do not include planned digital and radio spending, the campaign said. The totals reflect the importance of Mr. Bushâs performance in New Hampshire, where the former Florida governor’s team hopes voters will be more amenable to an establishment-backed Republican candidate with more moderate positions on issues like immigration. Mr. Bush will return to the state on Wednesday for two campaign events. âAs voters in early states and beyond get to know Jeb Bushâs record and vision, he is building support,â a campaign spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, said in a statement. âOur campaign will have the resources needed to be competitive throughout the calendar, ensuring Governor Bush is the nominee.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
