Television stations in South Carolina have pulled an ad from Stand for Truth, the âsuper PACâ supporting Senator Ted Cruz, after a legal review. The ad, titled âSanctuary,â was a version of an ad the group ran in Iowa, criticizing Marco Rubio for his record on immigration. It used the December attacks on San Bernardino, Calif., to stoke fear of terrorists sneaking into the country illegally, and cited the immigration deal Mr. Rubio pushed for in Congress in 2013 as evidence he worked to âallow sanctuary cities.â   âWe had our legal folks review it, and it was decided that this needed to be pulled and substituted,â Randy Ingram, the general manager of WBTW in Myrtle Beach, S.C., said, although he couldnât recall the specifics of the legal teamâs decision. He said other stations in the Media General umbrella, which includes WCBD in Charleston and WSPA in Greenville/Spartanburg, also pulled the ad. The decision was made on Friday, and the ad was pulled from rotation on Saturday. “The Sanctuary ad aired statewide on both television and digital in Iowa with no objection, receiving hundreds of thousands of views on digital,” Eric Lycan, an attorney for the group, said in a statement. He attributed it to a complaint from the Rubio campaign, and said “the ad has continued to air across the Palmetto State, and will resume on the station in question.” Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
