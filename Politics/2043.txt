In announcing his presidential bid Tuesday, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey laid out the type of campaign that should sound familiar to anyone who has attended of his trademark town halls: blunt, direct and saying exactly whatâs on his mind, those offended be damned. The question is whether it will prove effective outside of New Jersey. âI am not running for president of the United States to be elected surrogate prom king,â Mr. Christie said in his speech at his former high school, where he wasnât prom king but he was class president. Mr. Christieâs campaign is hoping that direct style will be what endears him to voters and sets him apart in a political world he views as too timid and too afraid to offend. Just like  his town hall style, where clips of his energetic banter and the occasional berating have often gone viral on YouTube, Mr. Christie showed in his announcement speech that he is comfortable playing ringmaster before the home-state crowd. He paced around the stage, eschewing the traditional comfort of a podium for his more familiar hand-held microphone. The round stage was in the center of the gymnasium, with people surrounding him, just like his town hall meetings — with lines designed to pack a punch. âWe have to stop worrying about being loved, and start worrying about being respected both at home and around the world,â he said. Next, it’s off to New Hampshire for Mr. Christie, where he will be doing a town hall a day for three straight days. Whether he actually brings that confrontational swagger to the state, where voters are used to more intimate — and polite — interactions with candidates, will be evident tonight at his first town hall event.
