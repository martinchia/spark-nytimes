With a financial crisis in China rattling global markets, Senator Marco Rubio plans to deliver a major foreign policy speech on Friday outlining how a Rubio administration would more assertively challenge the Chinese, joining leading Republican rivals in pressing this line of attack. China’s recent currency devaluations and stock market decline, which have spread to global markets, have drawn increasing criticism from his rivals, including Donald J. Trump and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.  Mr. Rubio had previously planned the Friday speech in Charleston, S.C., timing it to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in the Pacific Theater, and a week before China’s leader, President Xi Jinping, comes to Washington for a state visit with President Obama. Mr. Rubio, who previously served as the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific affairs, has in the past been critical of China’s human rights record. Last year, the senator visited the Philippines and Japan, two nations that have been embroiled in territorial conflicts with China. He also made a stop in South Korea, which has developed closer ties with Beijing in recent years amid concerns over North Korea’s nuclear program.
