Senator Bernie Sanders has a fellow son of Brooklyn making new radio ads on his behalf: Spike Lee. âWake up. Wake up, South Carolina!â Mr. Lee begins â nodding to the opening of his 1989 film âDo the Right Thingâ â in a 60-second commercial released on Tuesday in the state, where the Democratic presidential primary is on Saturday. Mr. Lee, who has spent his career making films about race and discrimination, may help Mr. Sanders as he struggles to cut into Hillary Clintonâs support from black voters. âI know that you know the system is rigged. For too long we have given our vote to corporate puppets,â he says, echoing Mr. Sandersâs crusade against a ârigged economy.â âNinety-nine percent of Americans were hurt by the great recession of 2008, and many are still recovering,â Mr. Lee says in the ad. âAnd thatâs why I am officially endorsing my brother Bernie Sanders. Bernie takes no money from corporations. Nada. Which means he is not on the take. And when Bernie gets into the White House, he will do the right thing.â âHow can we be sure?â he says, rattling off Mr. Sandersâs civil rights record: “Bernie was at the March on Washington with Dr. King. He was arrested in Chicago for protesting segregation in public schools. He fought for wealth and education equality throughout his whole career. No flipping, no flopping. Enough talk. Time for action.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
