SPARTANBURG, S.C. — As the sound of a fetal heartbeat filled the ultrasound room at a Christian pregnancy center here, Carly Fiorina grasped the elbow of the young woman on the table. âItâs good when people know what 17 weeks look like,â Mrs. Fiorina told Lacey Thomas, who was flat on her back, as the two eyed a large-screen television magnifying the ultrasoundâs images. This was no mere small talk between ardent opponents of abortion rights. Rather, Mrs. Fiorinaâs remarks were delivered to an audience of more than 20 journalists who took turns cramming into the examination room. And it was aimed squarely at Planned Parenthood, which Ms. Fiorina and other Republicans want to deny all federal funds over accusations that the organization profits by selling aborted fetuses for medical research. Ms. Fiorinaâs passionate denunciation of Planned Parenthood was one of her more defining moments in the Sept. 16 Republican presidential debate. She dared President Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton to watch undercover videos of the organization, saying, âWatch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.â But Democrats and Planned Parenthood, citing inaccuracies in her description of the videos, quickly accused Mrs. Fiorina of claiming to have watched something that did not exist. Mrs. Fiorinaâs âsuper PACâ then released an advertisement showing her remarks in the debate interspersed with graphic images of a fetus, but Planned Parenthood has called those images misleading and the ad âfraudulentâ and demanded that Mrs. Fiorina take it down. âThere is no polite way to say this: Carly Fiorina is lying,â Eric Ferrero, a spokesman for the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement Thursday. âThere is no video showing anything like what she claims. It’s just totally false, no matter how many times she repeats it.â Mrs. Fiorinaâs visit to the Carolina Pregnancy Center here is a routine stop for Republican presidential candidates touring this important primary state: Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Ted Cruz have all come to its offices in a strip mall just off Interstate 585. The group says it âexists to provide abortion alternatives,â post-abortion support and abstinence education âwith the hope of transforming lives through Jesus Christ.â Inside, Mrs. Fiorina smiled at the stacks of maternity and baby clothes, offering help from a charity she is chairwoman of, good360.org. In the examination room with Ms. Thomas, who is expecting her second child, Mrs. Fiorina lingered for about 10 minutes, chit-chatting about the due date and the name Ms. Thomas and her husband had chosen for her baby (Riddick Dayne). She took note of the spinal cord on the TV display, then thanked Ms. Thomas for letting her âand all the cameras come in here.â âOh, thank you,â replied Ms. Thomas, who admitted that it felt odd at first to have so many strangers watch her ultrasound, but said she was proud to demonstrate âthe importance of life.â âWe need a woman president,â she called to Mrs. Fiorina as the candidate made her exit. Outside, Mrs. Fiorina turned to the attack. âLiberals and progressives will spend inordinate amounts of time and money protecting fish, frogs and flies,â Mrs. Fiorina said, adding: âThey do not think a 17-week-old, a 20-week-old, a 24-week-old is worth saving. This, ladies and gentlemen, is hypocrisy, and it goes to the core of the character of our nation.â But when asked if she thought it was worth shutting down the government over federal financing for Planned Parenthood, Mrs. Fiorina avoided a direct answer. âI think this is a fight worth having, I think that the leadership in the House and Senate should stand up and have this fight,â she said, before an aide drew a halt to questions.
