Jeb Bush’s campaign has invited leading donors to its Miami
headquarters on Monday for a fundraising call-a-thon, part of a final
push to maximize their haul for this quarter ahead of the end-of-month finance deadline. In an email to contributors, Bush finance director Heather Larrison
wrote that the donors could also make the calls from home if they were unable to come to Florida. “We would appreciate all of our friends across the country dedicating
a few more hours before the end of the month to helping the mission,” wrote Ms. Larrison Mr. Bush, who has been slipping in many polls, raised over $100
million for his “super PAC” in the first half of the year.  But collecting contributions for the campaign, in which individuals are limited to giving $2,700 per-person, is far more difficult and Mr. Bush’s report will be closely watched for how much he has expanded his universe of both large and small donors. He has dispatched family members to help with fundraising in recent
weeks, including his older brother, George W Bush, who raised money in two Texas cities last week. The call-a-thons have become staples of presidential campaigns in
recent years, with officials offering rewards for donors who reach
certain goals.  Bush donors who raise $50,000 this quarter have been
invited to a Houston gathering next month that will feature Mr. Bush
and both former Presidents Bush.
