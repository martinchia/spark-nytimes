Carly Fiorina, a former Republican candidate, endorsed Ted Cruz for president at a campaign event in Miami. MIAMI â Carly Fiorina endorsed Senator Ted Cruz of Texas on Wednesday, supplying his campaign with a high-profile supporter and an eager critic of Donald J. Trump. Mrs. Fiorina, the former presidential candidate and Hewlett-Packard chief executive, took to the role quickly, appearing as a surprise guest at Mr. Cruzâs morning rally in Florida. âSome people are now saying: âWell, Donald Trump wouldnâtâ be so bad.

In her first act as a Cruz supporter, Mrs. Fiorina even managed to praise the senator using a favored Trump phrase. âHe has won over and over and over,â Mrs. Fiorina said of Mr. Cruz. âHe has won.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
