Donald J. Trump said that The Scowl was deliberate. For the cover photo of his new book, âCrippled America,â he selected an unsmiling, pursed-lip, angry-looking image of himself, taken inside his office at Trump Tower. âIt’s a terrible, horrible nasty picture,â Mr. Trump said on Tuesday, with evident pleasure. So what did the book-buying public think of this potentially best-selling grimace? Many were perplexed. âThatâs what Iâm wondering,â said Doug Pressler, 54, as he stood in line on Tuesday to have (a smiling) Mr. Trump sign a copy of the new book on its inaugural day. âWhy have that?â âI was a little surprised by it,â Mr. Pressler said. âThe only possible reason I can think of is to show that America is, like the book says, crippled.â Others were charmed. John Canary called it a welcome break from the predictable book cover shot. âEvery other candidate smiles,â he said, waiting in line to meet Mr. Trump. He admired Mr. Trump for the candor of his facial expression, adding: âItâs just a nice scowl. Itâs a very well-composed picture.â  What, exactly, was behind the frown? Turns out Mr. Pressler was right. As Mr. Trump explained on Tuesday during the book signing, âwhen youâre talking about crippled America and youâre talking about all of the problems we have, I canât have a big smiley face out there.â By MICHAEL BARBARO Trump the Campaign and Trump the Marketing Machine are always difficult to disentangle. But whatever thin buffer had kept them separated the last few months evaporated entirely on Tuesday.
