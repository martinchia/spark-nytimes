For a moment, it seemed Donald J. Trump thought he had gone too far. The moment passed. Shortly after publishing, then deleting, a menacing Twitter post about the wife of Senator Ted Cruz, Mr. Trump quickly corrected himself late Tuesday â by adding more colorful language and punctuation to his threat. âLyinâ Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from G.Q. shoot in his ad,â Mr. Trump wrote in the slightly revised message. âBe careful, Lyinâ Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!â Mr. Trump appeared to be referring to a recent ad from the âsuper PACâ Make America Awesome, which showed Mr. Trumpâs wife Melania, a former model, posing nude. The ad, which was targeted to Mormon voters, has no ties to Mr. Cruzâs campaign. But the text beside an image of Mrs. Trump reads: âMeet Melania Trump. Your next first lady. Or, you could support Ted Cruz on Tuesday.â Less than 30 minutes after Mr. Trumpâs post, as primary results trickled in, Mr. Cruz responded. âPic of your wife not from us,â he wrote. âDonald, if you try to attack Heidi, youâre more of a coward than I thought. #classless.â It was unclear what Mr. Trump had in mind concerning Heidi Cruz, a businesswoman who worked in the administration of George W. Bush. Mrs. Cruz has spoken in the past about a trying moment in her life and marriage in 2005, when she suffered through what Mr. Cruz has described as a âperiod of depressionâ after moving to Texas from Washington to be closer to her husband. Mr. Trumpâs cryptic warning continued a pattern of mischief-making on Twitter. In the past, Mr. Cruz has often deflected some of Mr. Trumpâs more outlandish attacks by posting playful pop culture videos, often from the 1980s. More recently, Mr. Cruz has teased his rival by calling him â#DuckingDonaldâ over Mr. Trumpâs decision to bypass presidential debates. There was a time when relations were less strained. In December, months into his long embrace of Mr. Trump on the campaign trail, Mr. Cruz still appeared eager to praise. âThe Establishmentâs only hope: Trump & me in a cage match,â Mr. Cruz wrote then. âSorry to disappoint â @realDonaldTrump is terrific. #DealWithIt.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
