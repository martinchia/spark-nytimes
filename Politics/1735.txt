Gov. John Kasich of Ohio is going on the air in New York with a commercial that amounts to a preview of his message for a summer convention battle, arguing that he is the only Republican who can defeat Hillary Clinton in November if she is the Democratic nominee. At the same time, Mr. Kasichâs team is calling on Republicans eager to stop Donald J. Trump to supplement the campaignâs efforts with their own advertising boosting Mr. Kasich ahead of New York’s presidential primary on April 19. The new commercial from the Kasich campaign asserts that Mr. Kasich would win a contested convention, and it casts aside Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who has a large delegate advantage on Mr. Kasich.  âDon’t be fooled,â the narrator says. âTed Cruz can’t win the nomination outright, and he can’t defeat Hillary Clinton either. John Kasich will win the convention, and he’ll defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall.â Mr. Kasich tends to poll slightly ahead of Mrs. Clinton in national poll match ups; Mr. Cruz does not have a clear advantage against her. The new commercial has a similar approach to an ad from the conservative Club for Growth that helped Mr. Cruz and hurt Mr. Kasich in Wisconsin â only with a focus on stopping Mrs. Clinton in this case, rather than stopping Mr. Trump. (âOnly Ted Cruz can beat Donald Trump,â the Club for Growth ad said. âJohn Kasich canât do it.â)  The new commercial from the Kasich campaign will air both upstate and downstate. At the beginning of last month, Mr. Kasichâs campaign had only a little over $1 million on hand; the campaign said it would spend a significant amount of money on the new commercial, although it declined to say how much. Earlier Thursday, the campaign released ads that went after Mr. Cruz over his comments about âNew York values.â  The Kasich campaign is also hoping that the âNever Trumpâ movement will help its cause in New York. A spokesman for Mr. Kasich, Mike Schrimpf, said that if those hoping to stop Mr. Trump are truly serious about their mission, the anti-Trump movement will âmake the same effort for John Kasich in New York as it did for Ted Cruz in Wisconsin.â âThe fact is while Ted Cruz disparages New York values, John Kasich is Donald Trump’s main competition in the state,â Mr. Schrimpf said.
