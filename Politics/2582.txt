A New York cellphone executive has emerged as a mystery megadonor behind the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Federal campaign finance reports identified the source of a $250,000 donation to the Stand for Principle PAC, a group backing Mr. Cruz, only as âV3 231 LLC.â But records tie the donation to Ben Nash, the chief executive of PCS Wireless, and a spokesman acknowledged that Mr. Nash was behind the donation. The spokesman, Robert Barletta, said in the statement that âV3 231 LLC, of which Ben Nash is a member of the ownership group, donated $250,000 to Stand for Principleâ in January.  âThe donation was transparent and fully within federal campaign finance laws,” Mr. Barletta said. “Senator Cruz has been a strong supporter of Jewish issues, and this was the basis for the donation.â Mr. Nash, a former Yeshiva student, co-founded PCS Wireless in 2001 as a teenager and built it into a major global distributor of new and used phones and mobile devices. More than any other candidate, Mr. Cruz and the political committees backing him have drawn their financial support from a remarkably small group of donors. A single donor â Robert Mercer, a hedge fund executive in New York â gave $11 million to one of the super PACs supporting him, and an investor based in Puerto Rico â Toby Neugebauer â donated another $10  million.
