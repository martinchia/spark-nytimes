President Obama will take the rare step of heading to Andrews Air Force Base outside of Washington to personally greet Pope Francis when he arrives for a visit on Sept. 22, the White House said on Wednesday. Presidents almost never go to Andrews to welcome visiting foreign leaders, instead waiting for them to make their way to the White House. But there is a papal exception. President George W. Bush went to Andrews in 2008 to greet Pope Benedict XVI, breaking tradition and setting a precedent. Mr. Obama, who met Pope Francis at the Vatican in March 2014 and shares some of the same concerns about income inequality and the environment even if they disagree on abortion rights and same-sex marriage, will host the pope at the White House for a formal arrival ceremony on the South Lawn.  “The president looks forward to continuing this conversation with the Holy Father during his first visit to the United States as pope,” the White House said in a statement.  The pope will address a joint meeting of Congress while in Washington.
