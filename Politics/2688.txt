Senator Bernie Sandersâs presidential campaign raised more than $33 million in the final three months of 2015, as his wide base of small-amount donors enabled him to come within $4 million of the amount raised by Hillary Clinton, his rival for the Democratic nomination, his campaign said Saturday. Mr. Sanders, a senator from Vermont, has now raised $73 million for his nomination fight, his aides said in a news release. The campaign said more than one million individual donors had made more than 2.5 million contributions, passing President Obamaâs previous record of about 2.2 million for the number of individual donations, which was set at the end of 2011. âThis people-powered campaign is revolutionizing American politics,â Jeff Weaver, Mr. Sandersâs campaign manager, said in a news release accompanying the release of the figures. Mr. Sandersâs spending on the campaign also appears to have shot up. The campaign now has $28.4 million in cash left from the $73 million raised, the release said. The release announcing the haul was replete with references to how, âunlike other campaigns,â Mr. Sanders was doing well with small-amount donors. The references were a veiled shot at Mrs. Clinton,  who raised $37 million in the last quarter and has taken in more than $112 million in donations over all. Mrs. Clinton also has a âsuper PACâ supporting her. Mr. Sandersâs campaign has aggressively targeted and courted low-dollar donors, developing a deep network of people it could keep tapping for new contributions. Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, struggled in the second and third quarters of the year to establish a low-dollar donor base, relying primarily on fund-raising events with ticket prices of $2,700 to bring in donations.. Last month, Mr. Sandersâs team said in a court filing related to a lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee over a denial of access to voter data that it anticipated losing $600,000 a day in donations. A spokesman for the campaign, Michael Briggs, said that was a reference to a short window of time and did not reflect the campaignâs daily intake of contributions. Two of the Republican candidates, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ben Carson, have released their fund-raising totals for the quarter. Mr. Cruz raised $20 million, a two-thirds increase from his previous quarter, and Mr. Carson raised $23 million.
