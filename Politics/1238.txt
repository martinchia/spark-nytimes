Good Wednesday morning from Washington, where Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont had a pleasant meeting on Capitol Hill, and where everyone is talking about the Iran nuclear deal. Now that the marathon sessions with Iranian officials have proved fruitful, President Obama must pitch it all over again. A day after reaching a deal limiting Iran’s nuclear abilities, Mr. Obama will begin what might be an even harder job: selling it to a skeptical Congress. The president is set to hold a news conference on Wednesday afternoon to make the case for the agreement, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is scheduled to meet with House Democrats on Capitol Hill. Other top administration officials will be fanning out to work over individual lawmakers and interest groups to try to rally them behind what the administration believes is a solid agreement holding Iran’s nuclear ambitions in check. These events are just the first of what is likely to be an onslaught of briefings, congressional testimony, outreach efforts and media blitzes to offset a fierce pushback from Republicans, conservative groups and Israeli leaders among others. The White Houseâs first priority is to shore up Democratic support to make certain that the House and Senate cannot override any veto should Congress send Mr. Obama legislation blocking the agreement. But the White House would no doubt prefer congressional backing for the deal. It hopes to overcome some of the immediate Republican skepticism â echoed by some Democrats â that the deal is too generous to Iran and will restore that nation’s ability to fund terrorism while leaving Iran on the doorstep of a nuclear weapon. Complicating the administration’s efforts is the deep opposition voiced by Republican presidential contenders who will be relentless in their criticism. But the White House promised an exhaustive effort to build support for an agreement that senior administration officials said was better than what they had anticipated going in to the talks. â Carl Hulse Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. After his Iran news conference, Mr. Obama will travel to Durant, Okla., to give a speech, the White House says, “on expanding economic opportunity for communities across the country, including the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma.” Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, will deliver to Congress the Fed’s midyear economic outlook, where she is bound to face questions. And on the trail, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas will speak at the Delivering Alpha hedge-fund conference in New York; Ben Carson and Rick Santorum will each have several events in Iowa; and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin will be in South Carolina and in Georgia.   Mr. Trump is in a statistical tie with Jeb Bush in a Suffolk University/USA Today national poll of potential primary voters released on Tuesday. The survey is the latest in a succession of strong showings since Mr. Trump announced his campaign last month and made inflammatory comments about illegal immigrants. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders ran into each other in Washington at a Senate meeting, and though the ensuing encounter was warm and friendly, Mr. Sanders later released a statement detailing several issues upon which they differ. And another rival for the Democratic nomination, Martin O’Malley, pledged on Tuesday to go further on overhauling the immigration system than any other candidate. In a long and at times passionate address in Philadelphia to a convention of the N.A.A.C.P., Mr. Obama called for an effort to fix a “broken” criminal justice system. The Iran deal prompted immediate responses from the 2016 field, with the Republican candidates issuing statements that warned of nuclear chaos in the Middle East, criticized Mr. Obama‘s abilities as a negotiator, and called on Congress to stop the deal.Later in the day, Mr. Walker went further in his criticism and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said that while he agreed with reaching out to Iran, he did not support the deal. And in The New York Times Magazine, Mark Leibovich writes about the “Re-Re-Reintroducing” of Mrs. Clinton and the “meticulously managed rollout of a candidate whom voters think they know already.” Presidential contenders are set to provide the first official glimpse inside their campaign war chests on Wednesday, with Mr. Bush, Mr. Cruz, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida expected to lead a crowded Republican field in the all-important money race. On the Democratic side, Mrs. Clinton appears to be far outpacing her rivals for the partyâs nomination, and her campaign expects to report raising about $45 million so far in her White House bid. The financial statements â expected to be filed and released publicly by the Federal Election Commission â will give the first detailed accounting of how the candidates are raising and spending hundreds of millions of dollars to try to get elected. But while the reports will provide an early look at the candidatesâ financial operations, they promise only part of the story, because they do not include any of the money being raised by the âsuper PACsâ supporting many of the candidates. With an outsize role in the campaign, many of the super PACs could end up raising more money for a candidate than the campaigns themselves. — Eric Lichtblau An image was posted from Mr. Trump‘s Twitter account on Tuesday, The Washington Post and others reported, that showed his face transposed on an American flag alongside the White House, and what seems to be a stock photo of Nazi soldiers. The post was deleted, and an intern was blamed. Mr. Obama has faced criticism from Republicans, PBS’s “NewsHour” writes, over his response to the killing of a woman in San Francisco by an immigrant who had been released despite a long criminal record. And, Politico writes, Mr. Bush sent an emissary on the New Horizons spacecraft’s nine-year, three billion-mile journey past Pluto. “On board was a Florida state quarter given to Alan Stern, New Horizonsâ principal investigator, by then-Gov. Jeb Bush in 2005.” Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, who have warm relations, are supposed to meet on Wednesday in New York, The Washington Post writes. Mr. Sanders faces long odds in his quest to keep dark money and corporate America out of politics, but he does have the founders of one company in his corner: Ben & Jerryâs. The ice cream makers are backing Mr. Sanders in his continuing push to undo the Citizens United Supreme Court decision. âBernie has led the fight to put an end to the corrupting influence of big money in our politics,â Ben Cohen wrote in a note to Mr. Sandersâs supporters. The Vermont-based ice cream entrepreneurs argue that companies and people are different, even when the company is named after two people, and that corporations should keep their cash away from elections. âFrom the very beginning, Bernie’s called for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United â something with which we couldn’t agree more,â Jerry Greenfield wrote. Despite their desire to reduce the role of money and politics, Ben & Jerryâs has been accused in the past of being too cozy with Mr. Sanders. In May, a Republican National Committee strategist said the senator was hypocritical for accepting free ice cream from the company when he kicked off his campaign. Denying any wrongdoing, the company said that Mr. Cohen and Mr. Greenfield donated the dessert as private citizens. Although it shares similar values with Mr. Sanders, Ben & Jerryâs considers itself to be a nonpartisan ice cream enterprise. — Alan Rappeport Like the Politics Newsletter?
