In November 2012, Kris Balderston, then in charge of the Global Partnership Initiative in Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s office, sent an email about a potential joint initiative involving the State Department and the Rockefeller Foundation. The email was sent to a group of people, including Huma Abedin, the deputy chief of staff to Mrs. Clinton, and to Thomas Shea, who at the time was one of the managing directors of Teneo, the firm where Ms. Abedin had a contract as a consultant, and which represented the Rockefeller Foundation. Ms. Abedin quickly replied that she needed to be removed from the discussion because she was concerned about a conflict of interest. But the exchange demonstrated the potential for such issues to have arisen as part of her status as a special government employee, a designation that allowed her to work for Teneo, the State Department, the Clinton Foundation and the Clintons personally. A spokesman for Mrs. Clinton declined to comment.  The email exchange was part of a trove obtained by the conservative group Citizens United, which has sued the State Department to provide such emails after Freedom of Information requests went unanswered. Officials with the group had made several requests for emails, including those involving Ms. Abedin and officials at Teneo, a consulting firm that was created by Doug Band, a close friend of Ms. Abedin and the former counselor to former President Bill Clinton. Ms. Abedin began working as a consultant with Teneo at the beginning of August 2012, not long after she gave birth to her son, Jordan. A year earlier, her husband, Anthony Weiner, had resigned his congressional seat amid a sexting scandal. Mr. Band told people at the time that he hoped to show Ms. Abedin a window into a world outside of the Clinton orbit, and help a friend who was in a difficult personal situation. The firm was co-founded in 2011 by Mr. Band and Declan Kelly, who had been Mrs. Clinton’s economic envoy to Northern Ireland, appointed in 2009.  On Nov. 1, 2012, Mr. Balderston sent the email, with the subject line, âdiaspora meeting follow-up,â to a group of people. The main recipientâs name and email have been redacted by the State Department, but Mr. Balderston, a former campaign aide to Mrs. Clinton, addressed the email to âJudith,â suggesting it was Judith Rodin, who leads the Rockefeller Foundation and is an old friend of Mr. Clinton. Others on the exchange included Thomas Debass, an official at the State Department, and Mr. Shea, who before joining Teneo had been a chief of staff to Gov. Jon Corzine of New Jersey. Ms. Abedin responded solely to Mr. Balderston 30 minutes later, the documents show. âYou should de-loop me from these exchanges,â she wrote. âWhen this was a matter of Judith coming up to me randomly asking about rockefeller partnership with state, it was one thing,â she wrote, using lower-case letters throughout. âBut now that teneo is involved, I feel I have a conflict so best not to be a part of this. It makes me uncomfortable.â âAbsolutely. Sorry about that,â was the reply from Mr. Balderston. Ms. Abedinâs lawyers have repeatedly said that her status as a special government official was one that several other employees have had throughout the agency, and elsewhere, and that it was cleared by the State Department’s legal and human resources offices. But her proximity to Mrs. Clinton over nearly two decades has raised great interest in how she managed her various roles. According to people briefed on the matter, Ms. Abedin made a total of $105,000 during her tenure at Teneo, which lasted seven months. Teneo officials, according to these people, had Ms. Abedin sign a contract before she joined as a consultant that contained a clause saying she would not to do anything that could be considered a conflict of interest with her role as a State Department adviser.
