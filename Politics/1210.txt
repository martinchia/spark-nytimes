Senator Marco Rubio of Florida issued a sharp critique of China’s behavior on Friday, using a speech in South Carolina and an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal to fault Beijing on such issues as military expansionism, cybertheft, human rights abuses and “economic misconduct.” Mr. Rubio, a Republican presidential candidate, also accused President Obama of continuing “to appease China’s leaders” despite their misbehavior, assertions that came as the president’s national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, was meeting with China’s president, Xi Jinping, in Beijing to lay the groundwork for Mr. Xi’s state visit to Washington next month. “President Obama has continued to appease Chinaâs leaders despite their mounting aggression,” Mr. Rubio wrote in Journal piece. “In addition to his insufficient responses to economic and national security concerns, he has ignored the Chinese governmentâs mass roundups of human-rights advocates, oppression of religious minorities, detention of political dissidents, ever-tightening controls on the Internet and numerous other human-rights violations. He has hoped that being more friendly with China will make it more responsible. It hasnât worked.” While one of Mr. Rubio’s campaign rivals, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, has called on Mr. Obama to cancel Mr. Xi’s state visit, Mr. Rubio did not go that far, instead suggesting that the event be “downgraded to a working visit from a state visit.” “This is an opportunity to speak bluntly to this authoritarian ruler and achieve meaningful progress, not to treat him to a state dinner, Mr. Rubio said in the op-ed piece. Speaking in Nirth Charleston, S.C., Mr. Rubio pressed his case by highlighting China’s territorial aggression, “economic misconduct” and human rights. He said that under Mr. Xi, “China has intensified its campaign to push America out of Asia.” And that if he is elected president, “instead of inviting China to military exercises, we will conduct joint freedom of navigation patrols with our partners in East and Southeast Asia to challenge any attempts to close off international waters or airspace.” In fact, the United States already conducts such military exercises with allies like Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, and has challenged Beijing’s territorial claims in the South China Sea. Mr. Rubio also said that he would confront China’s economic misconduct, but again highlighted an approach similar to the one taken by Mr. Obama by pursuing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. “As president, I would respond to Chinaâs economic misconduct not through aggressive retaliation, which would hurt us as much as them, but by reinforcing our insistence on free markets and free trade,” he said in his remarks, according to a transcript of his speech. “This means immediately moving forward with the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other trade agreements that strengthen strategic ties with our partners in Asia.” And as he has done in the past, Mr. Rubio pressed Beijing on the issue of human rights, promising action against Chinese officials believed to be tied to such abuses. “When I am president, Beijing will not receive a free pass on human rights,” the senator said. “I will instruct all U.S. officials meeting with their Chinese counterparts to list political prisoners by name and press for their unconditional release. I will impose visa bans and asset freezes on Chinese officials who violate human rights. I will do all I can to empower Chinese citizens to breach what has been called the Great Firewall of China, and gain access to news and information online about their country and the world.” By DAVID E. SANGER The faltering Chinese financial markets pose such a threat to American interests that a strategy of chiding Beijing over human rights or cyberattacks seems risky.
