The Supreme Court is getting closer to making is long-awaited ruling on same-sex marriage and, whatever the outcome, the political response is expected to be vocal along party lines. A new survey from the Pew Research Center offers a snapshot of where Republicans and Democrats stand on the issue, which will likely be injected into the 2016 presidential debates and campaigns as soon as the court makes its decision later this month. According to the survey of 2,002 adults, 65 percent of Democrats are in favor of same-sex marriage, while 34 percent of Republicans support it. While support for same-sex marriage has grown within both parties over the last 10 years, the gap between Republicans and Democrats remains the same. Supporters are made up largely of younger Americans, Catholics and Protestants who do not consider themselves to be evangelical. Despite the disparity between the parties, nearly three-fourths of Republicans, Democrats and independents say that they see it as inevitable that same-sex marriage will eventually be recognized legally. While Republicans appear to be in the minority in their opposition to same-sex marriage, they do seem to realize that they must do a better job explaining their views. The survey found that 57 percent of Republicans do not think the party does a good job expressing their opinions on the issue.
