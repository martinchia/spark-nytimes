Asked during Wednesdayâs debate to name his greatest weakness, Ben Carson decided to zig where some of his opponents zagged: He answered the question. âProbably in terms of the applying for the job of president, a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position,â he began, âuntil hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that I needed to do it.â On Thursday, before an event in Lakewood, Colo., Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, held forth on the life he had envisioned before political ambitions intervened. âI was planning on retiring,â he said, ânot setting my alarm clock, reading all the books Iâve never read, watching the movies I havenât seen, playing golf, learning how to play the organ. Thatâs what I envisioned. I did not envision being president of the United States.â Standing behind him, Mr. Carsonâs wife, Candy, chimed in. âAnd I wanted my husband back,â she said to laughs. Asked if he saw himself differently now, Mr. Carson replied, âvery much so.â âYou know, things happen,â he said, in an apparent allusion to the groundswell of support. âAnd you respond to them.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
