When Martin O’Malley began actively exploring a presidential run in 2013, he reached out to Hillary Rodham Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, to let her know. She told him he should do
what he needed to do. So as Mr. O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, prepared for his Saturday campaign kickoff, he reached out to Mrs. Clinton again. The call between the two was brief and cordial, according to two people briefed on it, neither of whom was authorized to describe the private conversation.  Aides to both Mr. O’Malley and Mrs. Clinton
declined to comment. As he prepared to challenge Mrs. Clinton for the Democratic nomination, Mr. O’Malley has been reluctant to criticize Mrs. Clinton or to draw a pointed contrast with her. But once he enters the race Saturday, Mr. O’Malley is expected to highlight his positions on issues important to the party’s liberal base and try to appeal to Democrats who may be looking for an viable alternative to Mrs. Clinton.
