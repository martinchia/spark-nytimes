                                        CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- It may have been a bit early for goofy-Hollywood-guest night, and the guest was about five decades too young. But Kal Penn reported for duty on Tuesday, armed with a pitch for young voters.  
                                        &apos;&apos;I am honored to accept your nomination for president of the United States,&apos;&apos; said Mr. Penn, an actor who worked in the White House and is a surrogate for the president when he is not playing a charming slacker in the &apos;&apos;Harold
                                        & Kumar&apos;&apos; movies.  
                                        Praising Mr. Obama, his former boss, for ordering the raid that killed Osama bin Laden and for making it possible for people to get &apos;&apos;gay married,&apos;&apos; Mr. Penn said, &apos;&apos;Thank you, invisible man in the chair.&apos;&apos;  
                                        Earlier in the day, the Obama campaign released a video in which the president appeared in a skit with Mr. Penn and his &apos;&apos;Harold & Kumar&apos;&apos; co-star, John Cho. Mr. Obama was shown calling Mr. Penn to recruit him to help turn out
                                        the youth vote.  
                                        &apos;&apos;There&apos;s a lot at stake here,&apos;&apos; a stern-looking Mr. Obama said into the phone. &apos;&apos;Just remember that I&apos;m trusting you on this.&apos;&apos;  
                                        Cut to Mr. Penn and Mr. Cho, sacked out with empty pizza cartons in what looks suspiciously like a post-marijuana case of the munchies. &apos;&apos;That was the president,&apos;&apos; Mr. Penn said after hanging up and trying desperately to focus.
