A Bush family portrait. A book signed by Donald J. Trump. Six yards of mulch. At a local Republican dinner in Bettendorf, Iowa, on Tuesday evening, Jeb Bush commanded top billing, kicking off a three-day Iowa swing with a keynote speech at a trying moment in his campaign. But in the event space where Mr. Bush spoke, an eclectic medley of silent auction fodder â two rib-eye steaks, Bush-Quayle and Bush-Cheney campaign buttons, a âconcealed carry package,â the prose of Bill OâReilly â was not to be ignored. Guests at the gathering, organized by the Scott County Republicans, stopped often to bid or, at least, to investigate. What to make of the âwhimsicalâ elephant necklaces? The Ted Cruz book, packaged with âGreen Eggs and Ham,â which he once read on the Senate floor? The photo of Jeb and George H.W. Bush playing tennis? âValue: Priceless,â read an attached appraisal, optimistically. Most candidatesâ books were valued at $30. (The autobiography of Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor who left the presidential race last month, struggled to attract bids.) Some items fared better. Paul D. Pate, Iowaâs secretary of state, lingered beside an image labeled âRepublican Satire Print.â It depicted an elephant standing atop a map of the United States, with a donkey tumbling into the Pacific Ocean. He bid $100.
