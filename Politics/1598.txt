LAS VEGAS â Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin branded himself a âfighter and winnerâ over a dozen times here on Tuesday in the first event of his presidential campaign, and said that if elected he wanted to take the fight directly to Iran in the wake of the just-finalized treaty over its nuclear program. âI will terminate that deal,” Mr. Walker said in a speech. “I will put in place crippling economic sanctions on Iran, and I will convince our allies to do the same.â  The desire to reinstitute sanctions against Iran (should they be dropped because of the deal) was an even stronger position than Mr. Walker took Monday in announcing his presidential candidacy,  when he pledged to repeal any âbad deal with Iranâ on his first day in the White House.  When asked after the event Tuesday how he would persuade some of the countries who worked together on the Iran deal to reconsider sanctions, Mr. Walker offered that if âAmerica is leading again, I believe we can convince our allies to do the same,â but he avoided mentioning anything specific with regards to Russia or China.   His speech to the roughly 400 people packed into a Harley-Davidson dealership here followed a similar script to Monday’s event. He was greeted by a friendly crowd of bikers and even some Wisconsonites in Green Bay Packers gear, applauding every line in the speech, and cheering especially loudly when he called for a stronger relationship with Israel. But also like his speech Monday in Waukeseha, Wis., Mr. Walker was met with protesters, this time about 30 members from the powerful Culinary Union, wearing red and shouting from across the parking lot. They didnât seem to bother Mr. Walker; he is familiar with protesters, as he likes to tell audiences how he stared down 100,000 demonstrators during his first term as governor. And he was ready with a quick attack line when asked about the protesters.    âWeâll let people like Hillary Clinton and others stand up with the big government special interests and the big government union bosses — weâre going to stand up for the hard-working taxpayer,â Mr. Walker said.
