Good morning on Friday, Sept. 11, 2015, 14 years later. CNN has released its lineup for the Republican debate next week: Carly Fiorina will be promoted to the prime-time event, and the soft-spoken Ben Carson will share center stage with Donald J. Trump, offering a split-screen study in contrasts of the current Republican front-runners. But that is for next week. On Friday, there will be a relative break from the typical campaign noise as candidates and public officials attend memorials and read the names of the dead. For 14 years, politics has been postponed on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks at the Pentagon and the World Trade Center that killed nearly 3,000 people and changed the country. This year is no exception. There will be few direct campaign events.Â Hillary Rodham Clinton, who as the junior senator from New York routinely took part in the anniversary ceremonies in Lower Manhattan, will have no public schedule.Â Bill Clinton, who has worked to raise money for the memorial for the victims of United Airlines Flight 93 that crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pa., also has no public schedule. George W. BushÂ will be in Dallas, honoring the day at an exhibit at his presidential museum.Â Jeb BushÂ will read the names of those killed in the attacks at a ceremony in New Hampshire. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.Â will take part in a ceremony at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in Manhattan. AndÂ President ObamaÂ will take part in two ceremonies, one at the White House and another at a town-hall-style event with service members at Fort Meade, Md. —Â Maggie Haberman What We’re Watching Today â Mr. Trump will appear on âThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.â He is one of several candidates to appear or who are scheduled to appear soon on the late-night comedy shows. Jeb Bush and Mr. Biden were on âThe Late Show With Stephen Colbertâ this week. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will be on the show next week, and Mrs. Clinton will be with Mr. Fallon. The week after, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Mr. Trump will also sit down with Mr. Colbert. â Mrs. Fiorina will speak on Friday at the National Federation of Republican Womenâs 38th Biennial convention in Phoenix, which runs through Sunday. â And Eagle Forum, a conservative advocacy group will hold its Eagle Council in St. Louis from Friday through Sunday. Mr. Carson, Rick Perry and Mike Huckabee will speak in the afternoon on Friday. Iran Deal All but Assured, G.O.P. Seeks to Pin Blame on Democrats Even many supporters ofÂ Mr. ObamaâsÂ nuclear accord say they expect Iran to breach the agreement, and Republicans have maneuvered aggressively to be sure that Democrats, who blocked efforts on Thursday to halt it, are held politically accountable if things go awry. As Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a speech on the Senate floor on Thursday: âTo my Democratic friends, you own this. You own every âiâ and every âtâ and every bullet. You own everything that is to follow, and it’s going to be holy hell.â And Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said it was incumbent on Mr. Obamaâs successor to repeal the accord. âIran may have a supreme leader, but American does not,â Mr. Rubio said. âIn this nation, we have a republic, and soon, we’ll have new leaders not only in this chamber, but also in the executive branch. I pray in their first day in office they will revise this deal, or history will condemn us.â ButÂ Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, offered another thought: What if Iran complies and the plan works? âIf this moves forward and the Iranians live with the agreement and don’t breach it, some important things are going to happen in terms of inspectors on site, centrifuges destroyed, some amazing things that make the Middle East and Israel safer,â Mr. Durbin told reporters at the Capitol. âAnd for someone to announce as one of our would-be president candidates did on the floor here âI am going to blow this agreement away if I ever have the chanceâ is really to ignore the possibility that it could work. And I want it to work.â â David M. Herzenhorn Our Favorites from The Times â Â Mr.Â TrumpâsÂ changing positions and general disregard for party orthodoxy make himÂ an improbable fit as the Republican standard-bearer. But he also faces a different and, in some ways, deeper divide with the social and religious conservatives so essential to the party he seeks to lead. â In next weekâs Republican debate, many of theÂ candidates are preparing aggressive new tactics,Â convinced that they are better off making forceful and targeted appeals to viewers, rather than trying to knock out Mr. Trump. â And thoughÂ Mr. Bidenâs trip to New York had the feel of a campaign swing, in his appearance on âThe Late Showâ he seemed to hint that he was not ready for a third presidential run. Bulletins: Insults, Polls and Populism âÂ Mr. TrumpÂ said on Thursday that he was not referringÂ toÂ Mrs. FiorinaâsÂ looks when he was quotedÂ in a Rolling Stone articleÂ as saying, âLook at that faceâ and, âWould anyone vote for that?â His commentsÂ drew criticismÂ fromÂ Mrs. Clinton. â Â Adding to the possibility thatÂ Mrs.Â ClintonÂ could lose the first two nominating contests,Â Mr. SandersÂ has for the first timeÂ taken a narrow leadÂ in Iowa according to a Democratic poll released on Thursday. In a national poll, Mrs. Clintonâs lead has shrunk, and she is in a statistical tie with leading Republicans in head-to-head surveys. âÂ AndÂ Mr. BushâsÂ tax planÂ has made clearÂ that Mr. Trumpâs brand of conservative populism had affected the Republican economic policy agenda, with implications beyond the nomination. Bush Plays Prankster as He Seeks to Shed a Trump Pejorative  A few feet into his walking tour of a pump distribution company in Exeter, N.H., Mr. BushÂ decided to play a prank. As a local television reporter peered into the camera, microphone in hand, Mr. Bush sidled up beside him, poking his head into the shot. He smiled, then quickly apologized. âI hope that didnât get you in trouble,â Mr. Bush said. He was told that it made for good TV. âSend me the clip,â he said. For a candidate hoping to resist the âlowÂ energyâ label supplied byÂ Mr. TrumpÂ in recent weeks, a campaign swing to discuss tax policy carries built-in limitations. But in a pair of stops in New Hampshire on Thursday, Mr. Bush seemed eager to try. He reminded reporters of his 80-hour workweeks as governor of Florida and revealed the code name bestowed upon him by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement: âEver-Ready.â Asked if he planned to change course for the second Republican debate next week, Mr. Bush said dryly, âIâm just going to be my boring normal self.â He waited a beat. âNo follow-up questions on that?â he asked. Hours later, in a feisty town-hall-style meeting at an elementary school in Salem, N.H., Mr. Bush surmised that much of the country still knows him only as âGeorgeâs boy and Georgeâs brother.â âIâve got to go earn it,â he said. He contrasted himself with âthe loud voices that donât have a plan,â before getting more specific. âLetâs talk about Donald Trump,â he said. âAsÂ Stephen Colbert said, letâs talk about the big orange elephant in the room.â The crowd laughed, and the candidate issued a clarification. âThatâs humor, Donald,â Mr. Bush said. âDonât tweet. Please. Please.â â Matt Flegenheimer O’Malley Sings for Name Recognition on Wall Street  Martin OâMalleyÂ tends to preach a Main Street message, but the struggling Democratic presidential candidate has taken his show to Wall Street in hopes of reaching voters and collecting some spare change. In aÂ video produced in conjunction with IJ.com, Mr. OâMalley, the former governor of Maryland who moonlights as an Irish folk rocker, took his guitar to Wall Street this week to show the world how to âmake an honest buckâ in the heart of the financial world. Wearing a black T-shirt, Mr. OâMalley strummed the tune of âThis Land Is Your Landâ outside the New York Stock Exchange as pedestrians wandered by. While most did not recognize or even notice Mr. OâMalley, who is similarly languishing in most polls, a few people took photographs, posed for selfies and even made donated change. Demonstrating how difficult it can be to open wallets on Wall Street without resorting to more traditional political pandering, Mr. OâMalleyâs haul totaled $1.74. âÂ Alan Rappeport What We’re Reading Elsewhere  â Â Mr. TrumpâsÂ campaign,Â The Washington Post writes, is like a game of âCalvinball,â the make-up-the-rules-as-you-go sport from the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, which, The Post argues, makes running against him difficult. But,Â Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and othersÂ haveÂ engaged in attacks against him, with Mr. Christie calling Mr. Trump’s recent argument with the radio host Hugh Hewitt âunpresidentialâÂ and Mr. Jindal calling him a ânarcissistâ and âegomaniacâ who has not read the Bible âbecause he’s not in it.â â Â The Boston GlobeÂ profilesÂ FarrisÂ andÂ Dan Wilks, brothers who became billionaires by investing in hydraulic fracturing and who, âseizing upon the opportunity presented by loosened election laws,â have âdonated more money to so-called super political action committees in this presidential election than any other family.â â Â And The Wall Street JournalÂ reportsÂ on an analysis ofÂ Mr. BushâsÂ tax proposals thatÂ âshows that the biggest percentage increases in after-tax income under Mr. Bushâs tax plan would go to the top 1 percent of earners.â
