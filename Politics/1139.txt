Gov. Terry E. Branstad, Republican of Iowa, and Gov. Jack Markell, Democrat of Delaware, will bring a bipartisan focus to education on Tuesday in the hopes of urging the presidential candidates to focus more closely on developing strong teachers nationally.   The âTeach Strongâ conference will take place in Washington and aims to bring together different sides of the debate over education and âto make modernizing and elevating the teaching profession the top education policy priority in 2016 and beyond.â The topic has not been among the more central in the presidential race so far, though when it has been raised, it has been primarily within the Democratic contest, as candidates vied for the backing of teachers unions.  But an education overhaul has been one of the signature topics of the Obama administration. And reaching a consensus between the political parties, particularly as the Common Core educational standards have become contentious, has been difficult.
