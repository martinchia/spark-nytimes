ATLANTA â Donald J. Trumpâs suggestion that a Fox News journalist who questioned him during the Republican debate was aggressive because she was menstruating led a conservative group on Friday night to disinvite the real estate mogul from a prominent conservative forum. Erick Erickson, the organizer of the RedState Gathering here, said that Mr. Trumpâs comment about the journalist, Megyn Kelly, was âa bridge too far.ââ Mr. Trump had criticized Ms. Kelly earlier Friday on CNN because of her sharp questioning of Mr. Trump during the debate over insults he had directed at women. “She gets out and she starts asking me all sorts of ridiculous questions,” Mr. Trump said in the CNN interview. âYou could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.ââ  In an entry posted on the RedState blog at 11:56 p.m., Mr. Erickson wrote that he admired Mr. Trump for his bluntness and for connecting with âso much of the anger in the Republican base.ââ âBut there are even lines blunt talkers and unprofessional politicians should not cross,ââ he wrote. âDecency is one of those lines.ââ âI just donât want someone on stage who gets a hostile question from a lady and his first inclination is to imply it was hormonal,ââ he said. Mr. Trump was to have been the final speaker at the RedState Gathering, appearing at a âtailgate partyâ at the Football Hall of Fame in Atlanta on Saturday night. Mr. Erickson wrote that Mr. Trumpâs âteamâ had sought to walk back his remark, saying the billionaire had meant to say âwhatever,ââ not âwherever.ââ Carly Fiorina, the former technology executive who is the only woman seeking the Republican nomination, also sharply criticized Mr. Trump over the remark. On Twitter, Ms. Fiorina wrote, âI stand with @megynkellyâ and âMr. Trump: There. Is. No. Excuse.ââ Mr. Trump: There. Is. No. Excuse. â Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) 8 Aug 15 Ms. Fiorina spoke at the RedState conference on Friday, where she was warmly greeted following a standout performance in the âundercardâ debate that preceded the main debate Thursday, in which Ms. Kelly was one of three moderators. Addressing Mr. Trump, Ms. Kelly had cited Mr. Trump’s past characterizations of women — as âfat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals,â she said — and asked if he was handing Democrats ammunition to accuse Republicans of waging a war on women. Mr. Trump dismissed the concern as “political correctness.” At a debate-watching party at the RedState Gathering, hundreds cheered Mr. Trumpâs reply. Many attendees explained that while they favored more conventional candidates in the race — mainly, anti-establishment conservatives like Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana — they sympathized with Mr. Trump for being belittled by the Republican elite and the news media. A popular opinion among attendees was that Mr. Trumpâs entry into the race was a left-wing plot by Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton to undermine Republicans. At many moments in his wild and improbable rise, Mr. Trump has been counted out by commentators and Republican leaders because of his divisive remarks, including his belittling of Senator John McCainâs years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. It is possible that in losing Mr. Erickson, who has his finger on the pulse of the partyâs anti-Washington base, Mr. Trump may finally have gone too far. Mr. Erickson invited Ms. Kelly to address the gathering in Mr. Trump’s place on Saturday night. By JONATHAN MARTIN and MAGGIE HABERMAN Mr. Trumpâs suggestion that Ms. Kelly had questioned him forcefully at the Republican debate because she was menstruating cost him a speaking slot at an influential gathering.
