HAMPTON, N.H. â The question came from a self-proclaimed âBush-o-phile,â and the answer offered a fascinating, if free-form, glimpse into Bush family dynamics. Why, the voter asked, is Jeb Bush not using his father and brother â George Bush and George W. Bush, the 41st and 43rd presidents of the United States â more on the campaign trail, to help him rise in the polls? (âYour polls not being higher than they are,â the voter prodded, helpfully.) First, Jeb Bush tried the heâs-his-own-man trope. âPeople are going to vote for me,â he said, noting that heâs a â62-year-old man that has some life experience.â He added: âThey may love my dad. Some may love my brother and not love my dad. Itâs a little more complicated. Itâs not all kind of a unified deal.â Next, the former Florida governor tried the but-heâs-also-a-proud-Bushie response. âIâm proud of them, Iâm not running away from them, that is total nonsense,â he said. âIâm not running away from my brother or my dad, but I know for a fact that Iâm going to have to win this because Iâm running for president and people have to have confidence that I have the skills to lead.â Then he grew slightly philosophical. âAnd so, I spend time talking about my family in a loving way,â he said. âBut you canât ignore them because thatâs weird. Thatâs kind of a strange thing. But you canât over-rely on them either. Thereâs a balance.â Moments later, Jeb Bush announced among the worst kept â but most closely guarded â secrets of his campaign: That his older brother George W. will likely soon be joining him on the trail.  âIâm sure my brother will be campaigning for me by my side,â he said. And then Jeb Bush couldnât help but address a general concern about his candidacy. âThere are people who think itâs a little odd for a third Bush to be president of the United States,â he said, echoing a semi-common voter refrain. âThe expectations on me are higher because of that. Fine. You know who has higher expectations than conventional wisdom? Me. I have higher expectations of myself.â Finally, he inadvertently stepped on his own campaign news, revealing that his mother had cut a video appeal for him, set to go public on Friday. In a campaign video released by the Bush campaign, the family matriarch Barbara Bush talks about Jeb. Later, asked by reporters about his motherâs video, he joked, âDid I say that? I said it out loud?â before acknowledging the obvious: âI donât think she was prepared to endorse anyone else,â Mr. Bush said, âbut itâs a nice validation just in case people were wondering.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
