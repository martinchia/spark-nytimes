The Democratic National Committee, which has spent years feasting on Gov. Chris Christie as a target for derision, is welcoming the New Jersey governor to the presidential race with a post on Medium that laces into his record. The post describes the governor’s record as “terrible,” pointing to the George Washington Bridge scandal and his record handling the state’s finances, and faults him for the personality-driven campaign he’s expected to run after he declares his candidacy on Tuesday. While the D.N.C. has been relentless in criticizing Mr. Christie, and has taken swings at all of the Republican hopefuls in one way or another, there is another potential aim for the party in singling the governor out â elevating a politician who had fallen in many polls and one who can take votes away from Jeb Bush and make his path to the nomination more difficult. Mr. Christie and Mr. Bush both occupy a share of the Republican establishment lane, and the New Jersey governor can potentially cut into the former Florida governor’s share of support. Mr. Christie has not yet started to raise money, but his chances of success in the presidential race appear to have been diminished after a year of scandal. Because of that, and because of his late entrance into the race, Mr. Christie has become something of an afterthought in political coverage of the nascent 2016 campaign. By focusing on him, Democrats can help increase the chances that the spotlight stays on him â and are sure to continue to do so.
