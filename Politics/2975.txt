Of all the problems that might cause Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew to lose sleep â a bankrupt Greece and an aggressive China, terrorist financing and Iran sanctions, tax and banking disputes â he could hardly have foreseen that his recent âgood newsâ announcement about seeking a woman’s portrait for the $10 bill would end up among them. The latest critic: Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Lewâs former boss at the State Department, who valued him so much that she protested when President Obama in 2010 snatched Mr. Lew to the White House. âPretty second class,â she scoffed of Treasuryâs plan to put a woman’s picture on the $10 bill but also keep some image of Alexander Hamilton.  âI think a woman should have her own bill,â Mrs. Clinton said in an interview with CNN on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, Mr. Lew opted to grin and bear it, while signaling no change in Treasuryâs plans. âWhat we meant to do is to trigger a broad public debate, and we have triggered a broad public debate,â he said, prompting knowing laughter from his audience at the left-leaning Brookings Institution. Its scholars now include former Ben S. Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, who recently wrote that he was âappalledâ that Mr. Lew would âdemoteâ Hamilton, who as the first Treasury secretary âwas without doubt the best and most foresighted economic policymaker in U.S. history.â  Like many other Americans who have opined after Treasuryâs online invitation last month, Mr. Bernanke said â and Mrs. Clinton implied â that Mr. Lew should have a woman replace Andrew Jackson, a banking foe as president, on the $20 bill. But Mr. Lew, at Brookings, reiterated that the $10 note was chosen so that a woman would be on paper currency for the first time in more than a century âas soon as possible.â The $10 bill is next in the governmentâs sequence of currency to be updated to guard against counterfeiting, he said.  Mr. Lew will decide on the honoree, with the publicâs help, by the end of the year. Even so, design and production issues will delay the noteâs introduction until 2020. Mr. Lew did not clarify how or where Hamilton might appear on the redesigned bills with the woman to-be-named.
