Chris Christie, who is enjoying a bump in popularity in New Hampshire, mocked Marco Rubio on Saturday for not visiting the state more often. With more pointed comments than usual and a dismissive aside âÂ “He’s never here” â Mr. Christie, the New Jersey governor, increasedÂ his attacks on Mr. Rubio, the candidate who may be his biggest rival in the race for support from more establishment-oriented Republicans. Mr. Christie beganÂ by criticizing Mr. Rubio, who represents Florida in the Senate, for missing so many votes while he campaigns. “He doesn’t show up because he’s running for president,” he said. “Come on, Marco,” Mr. Christie continuedÂ before hitting Mr. Rubio for not being in New Hampshire enough âÂ a charge that the state’s largest paper, The Union-Leader, leveled at the senator recently in an editorial. (It has endorsed Mr. Christie). “He’s never here. But, you know, in Iowa or in New York at hedge fund places raising money.” An analysis of one month of candidate schedules by The New York Times showed that Mr. Rubio was appearing at public events less often than some rivals. But the topic is also a familiar one for Mr. Christie, who has been criticized by Democrats in New Jersey for putting his presidential ambitions ahead of the needs of the state he governs. He has spent considerable time out of the state as he campaigns for president. And he is due back in New Hampshire next week.
