Donald J. Trump, who is always happy to opine on matters of finance, said he possessed the prescience to unload much of his investment portfolio before the stock market took a dive in the past week. For those with less foresight, he has this advice: Hold your stocks, donât sell them. âPeople have taken a big hit,â he said in an interview on Monday. But, he added, âYou are better off holding.â Mr. Trumpâs logic is that it would be a cruel fate for investors who have already lost money in the latest market gyrations to sell off stocks only to watch the market rebound, as it historically does. âIâd hate to see it come back and they end up with the short end of both deals,â he said. âItâs a tough story,â Mr. Trump said. The time to sell, he added, was around a month ago. âI would have said sell, if you asked me this question three or four weeks ago.â The real estate developer said he has never concentrated much of his wealth in stocks, a fact confirmed by the personal financial disclosures he filed as a presidential candidate in July. With stocks, he said: âYou are so much in the hands of other people. You are in the hands of government and people who run companies.â Mr. Trumpâs July disclosure revealed a wide range of stock investments in companies like Apple, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Kinder Morgan, the energy company. But during the interview, he said he has sold off many of his stocks, without quantifying how many he still owns. âI had a feeling things were bad,â he said. âI had a feeling we were too reliant on Asia.â With that, Mr. Trump excused himself apologetically. He needed to tape an interview with Bill O’Reilly.
