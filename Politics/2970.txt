It can be a saving grace. Queue up the latest music video, say, from Taylor Swift on YouTube, and instead of having to wait for an entire car commercial to pass, a âSkip This Adâ button occasionally appears after five seconds. For political campaigns, the “Skip This” unit option, known as âTrueViewâ ads, can be less than optimal. While initially cheaper, they certainly donât guarantee a message reaches a voter. But Senator Rand Paulâs advertising team is embracing the technology, the first political campaign hoping to use the âskipâ button quirk to its advantage. The Paul campaign has bought “TrueView” ads that are running in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada this week. At the beginning of the ad, before the âskipâ button comes up, Mr. Paul makes a direct appeal: âPlease donât skip this video. We must take our country back.â  His campaign hopes the immediate âdonât touch that dialâ plea will surprise viewers with its rarity and pique their interest. âThe ultimate goal of this isnât just to be unique, itâs to get voters to actually watch the entire ad because normally theyâre skipping the ad,â said Vincent Harris, the chief digital strategist of the Paul campaign. âSo, it actually gets voters to pay more attention and wake up in this first five seconds and hopefully draw them more to the content of the final 10 seconds and final 25 seconds.â The ad buy, which Mr. Harris called âpretty significant from a digital perspectiveâ in its scope, is part of what the campaign views as an important approach to digital advertising, where ads are no longer just cut for TV and put in different places online, but are cut specifically to the style of online platforms, from YouTube to Hulu to Facebook. The idea came to Mr. Harris while watching an ad on YouTube from Geico that made a similar plea. âIt actually kept my attention more that it was almost this barrier of advertising was broken,â he said. âItâs kind of ‘House of Cards’-esque, where you sort of talk directly to the camera.â
