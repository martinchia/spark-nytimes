In seeking to break through the “highest, hardest glass ceiling,” as Hillary Rodham Clinton deemed the potential election of the first female president in 2008, the Democratic presidential candidate first must break through with voters, a challenge she is having trouble overcoming, according to a recent focus group of Ohio voters. Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster, queried men and women in Ohio â a crucial prize for would-be presidents â and found that while Mrs. Clinton maintains a commanding position in the 2016 race, efforts to âhumanizeâ her have not completely taken hold. âStrong reservations also emerge when these voters consider her candidacy,â Mr. Hart wrote in a report on how Ohioans view Mrs. Clinton. âMany feel that they cannot relate to or trust her. Even her supporters express uneasiness about their ability to connect with her.â Despite the skepticism, polls have shown that Mrs. Clinton remains popular in Ohio and is in a strong position to win the Democratic nomination. But, as Mr. Hart explained, voters say there is glass curtain that allows them to see Mrs. Clinton but not relate to her. Views on Mrs. Clinton diverge between men and women, with female voters showing more excitement about the significant nature of her candidacy. Women tended to think that because she is a one of them she possesses greater organization and listening skills that would be valuable in the White House. And they saw her as a mother or sisterly figure.  Men, on the other hand, were a bit more skeptical and were intimidated by the idea of Mrs. Clinton as commander in chief. âShe is my wifeâs sister,â one male voter from Ohio said. âExtremely opinionated, is graceful at times, and totally available to rip your head off at other times.â The focus group was conducted in mid-November and consisted of 24 people, including Democrats, Republicans and independents.
