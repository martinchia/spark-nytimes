Good Friday morning from Washington, where hardly anyone seems to be in town. President Obama moves on to New York from Oklahoma and nearly every candidate seems to be heading to Iowa for a couple of large party gatherings. The Iowa caucuses are more than six months away, but party activists in the state will get the chance to size up several Republican presidential candidates at one time this weekend. Saturday brings the Family Leadership Summit meeting, the annual gathering in Ames intended to âinspire, educate and motivateâ conservatives. The lineup will include Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum, Ben Carson and Donald J. Trump. Breaking from the traditional cattle call, organizers will do away with speeches, and the candidates instead will each field about 20 minutes of questions from Frank Luntz, a conservative pollster. Drew Zahn, a spokesman for the gathering, said that the themes of the day would include national security, economics and religious freedom. There should be plenty to talk about after the recent Supreme Court decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage that have rankled many conservatives. The candidates will also have a better idea of where they stand on the fund-raising front now that the campaigns have released their latest financial disclosures. Mr. Trumpâs attendance at the event will most likely create additional buzz, as the billionaire businessmanâs contentious comments on immigration have become a litmus test for his fellow Republicans and have brought a sense of disorder to the process. For Mr. Trump, who has been married three times and has liberal views on some policy issues, it will be a chance to reintroduce himself to the religious conservative crowd at a time when he has been at or near the lead in several opinion polls. â Alan Rappeport Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. Mr. Trump is in Arkansas to speak to the state Republican Party, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is in New Hampshire, which figures prominently in his campaign strategy, while much of the rest of the field is in Iowa ahead of the summit meeting on Saturday. Mr. Cruz is among those spending his Friday in Iowa, where, among other places, he will stop by the baseball field from the movie “Field of Dreams.” And Mr. Obama‘s trip to New York will take him to a Democratic National Committee event. Ahead of the Republican meeting, the battle for the Iowa caucuses, waged sluggishly for much of this year, will spring to life on Friday night, when all five Democratic presidential hopefuls will appear together at a state party “Hall of Fame” celebration. For the first time, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who has drawn large crowds at his rallies, will appear on the same stage. They will be joined by Martin O’Malley, Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb, the three other candidates seeking the nomination. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders saw each other this week at a Senate luncheon, but that was behind closed doors. Mrs. Clinton will be, as she always is, watched more closely than the other candidates for how she responds to them â particularly Mr. Sanders, who has shaved points off her lead in Iowa. Yet Mr. O’Malley, Mr. Webb and Mr. Chafee, while polling well behind Mr. Sanders, have also developed their campaigns as agitators running against the party establishment (meaning Mrs. Clinton). It remains to be seen whether any of her rivals â as was the case in 2008, Mrs. Clinton will be the only woman on the stage â take a shot at her in their speeches. â Maggie Haberman The ride-hailing service Uber has become a part of the presidential debate, with questions about the responsibilities of employers, the virtues of technology and the necessity of workplace regulation at issue. Thursday was a busy day in Congress as the Senate passed a bill to revamp the No Child Left Behind education law, setting up a showdown with the House, which passed its own version last week, over how to revise a law widely reviled for its emphasis on standardized tests.Another potential showdown looms between the bodies after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, cast doubts on the House’s plan for a transportation bill. And Mr. Obama became the first sitting president to visit a federal prison on Thursday, part of an effort to reduce sentences for nonviolent offenders and to revamp life behind bars. Mr. Walker‘s first week as a formal candidate has offered a clear look at his strategy and the challenges he faces, as he must cater his message both to the South, which he sees as pivotal, and to New Hampshire, which is much more of a tightrope.  Jeb Bush took a ride with Uber in San Francisco, more than a dozen reporters surrounded him as he exited the vehicle. But his driver did not know who his passenger was. And granting tax incentives to persuade corporations to share more of their profits with employees is one of the central ideas to emerge from Mrs. Clinton‘s recently announced economic agenda, which relies mostly on standard Democratic proposals to address stagnant middle-class wages. Pollsters are having trouble determining who exactly Mr. Trump‘s supporters are: Many just seem to prefer the fact that he’s a straight-talking businessman, Politico reports. House Republican moderates, anxiously watching a bill that would allow individuals to refuse service to same-sex couples, have quietly drafted a novel alternative that would actually expand legal protections for gays. The legislation, which is described by proponents as a religious freedom bill and would be moved as an amendment to the First Amendment Defense Act, would narrow the scope of protections offered to groups declining services to same-sex couples seeking to marry. But it would also attach two provisions expanding protections long sought by gay rights groups: the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which outlaws workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation, and an amendment to the federal Fair Housing Act to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of protected characteristics of housing seekers. Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, said the move would be a way to address conservative concerns in the wake of the Supreme Courtâs same-sex marriage decision without identifying the Republican Party with anti-gay bigotry. As it is, he said, the First Amendment Defense Act, introduced by Representative RaÃºl R. Labrador, Republican of Idaho, and Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, is tempting the same backlash that Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana faced when he signed a state law permitting businesses to refuse service to gay couples as moral and religious protests. â Jonathan Weisman BuzzFeed takes a look at some old interviews with Mr. Sanders, in which he takes issue with, among others, President John F. Kennedy, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and Walter Mondale, expressing views that were “in keeping with the independent senatorâs long history of criticizing the Democratic Party.” The presidential campaigns are paying their staff members well, even those of candidates considered long shots, The Wall Street Journal reports. And in an interview with The New Yorker, Senator John McCain of Arizona “was eager to talk about” Mr. Trump. Referring to a rally on immigration that Mr. Trump held in Phoenix, drawing thousands, Mr. McCain said: âThis performance with our friend out in Phoenix is very hurtful to me,â because “what he did was he fired up the crazies.â Like the Politics Newsletter?
