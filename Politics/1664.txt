The announcements are arriving seemingly by the day from places like Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Arkansas and sometimes just online. But as the crop of Republican presidential candidates grows more crowded, thoseÂ who are thinking ahead to November 2016 areÂ increasingly befuddled by all the choices. A new poll from Quinnipiac University shows that at this early stage in the contest, the Republican pack is essentially leaderless, with five candidates â or likely candidates â leading the groupÂ with support of about 10 percent of voters apiece. Included in that tier are two former governors,  Jeb Bush and Mike Huckabee; Gov. Scott Walker; Senator Marco Rubio; and the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. “With no front-runner and identical numbers for the top five contenders, it’s a horse race which can only be described as a scrambled field,” Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a statement. Polling will be closely watched, as performance could determine eligibility to participate in debates. Senator Rand Paul, Senator Ted Cruz, Gov. Chris Christie and the real estate mogul-TV personality Donald Trump fill out the top nine in Quinnipiac’s survey of 1,711 registered voters, with the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina and Gov. John Kasich tied for the No. 10 and 11 spots at 2 percent each. That means names such as former Gov. George E. Pataki, who announced his candidacy on Thursday, and former Senator Rick Santorum, who officially declared on Wednesday, could be excluded from the debate stage in some cases, as would former Gov. Rick Perry, Gov. Bobby Jindal and Senator Lindsey Graham. As for Democrats, Hillary Rodham Clinton dwarfs Senator Bernie Sanders and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Her toughest Republican challengers in head-to-head matchups appear to be Mr. Rubio and Mr. Paul. There are some signs of weakness for Mrs. Clinton, as 53 percent of American voters find her not to be honest and trustworthy. However, 60 percent still consider her to be a strong leader. “Can you get low marks on honesty and still be a strong leader? Sure you can,” Mr. Malloy said. “Hillary Clinton crushes her Democratic rivals and keeps the G.O.P. hoard at arm’s length.” Follow the New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.
