Senator Bernie Sanders is on the verge of signing a joint fund-raising agreement with the Democratic National Committee, his aides said, a week after Hillary Rodham Clinton entered such an arrangement with the party. It remains to be seen how a joint fund-raising agreement with Mr. Sanders, the Vermont independent who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, would be carried out. Mr. Sanders has never aggressively courted the types of party donors who hold major national events. But his aides indicated that he would like to help the committee build its war chest in preparation for the 2016 general election. “Bernie is committed to trying to build the resources of the party for the election since we believe Bernie will be the nominee of the Democratic Party,” said the senator’s spokesman, Michael Briggs, adding that Mr. Sanders has helped his Senate colleagues raise funds in the past by appearing at events for the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee.  “The campaign will review the proposed joint fund-raising agreement with the D.N.C.,” Mr. Briggs said, “and if there are no problems with it, then Jeff Weaver, the campaign manager, will sign it and Bernie will participate in events as the schedule allows.” A spokeswoman for the national committee, Miryam Lipper, said: âThe D.N.C. has offered to engage in joint fund-raising with all five of our announced presidential campaigns. We are in continuing conversations, including with the Sanders campaign, and we hope to create partnerships that are best for all of our candidates and the party.â  By ERIC LICHTBLAU By refusing support from âsuper PACs,â Bernie Sanders has built a campaign that appears to be drawing even more rank-and-file support than President Obama did in 2008.
