Crowds and polling numbers go up and down in the initial days of presidential campaigns, so when it comes to measuring early enthusiasm for a candidate, fund-raising is often the bottom line. That’s why it’s no surprise that candidates are making the hard sell to get donors to give more dollars ahead of Tuesday night’s first-quarter deadline for reporting fund-raising totals. With less than 12 hours to go, the tactics have been all across the map. Senator Marco Rubio‘s campaign issued a warning with an email blast titled, “This could be bad.” What are they worried about? Without a strong fund-raising total, “It could mean that we donât reach our goal and outsiders could question the strength and long-term success of our campaign,” Mr. Rubio’s campaign said. “It could mean we canât afford to pay for Marcoâs travel on the campaign trail.” Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida has been enlisting his relatives  but not his brother to solicit donations. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has introduced an end-of-quarter “money bomb” in the hope that people will be inspired by the chance to see their name flicker across his campaign website. And Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has created an Federal Election Commission deadline countdown clock and told supporters that his campaign is 913 donations short. “I really need you on this one,” Mr. Cruz said. On the Democratic side, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is promoting how well his fund-raising efforts are going. In an email to supporters with the subject line “Let me be frank,” Mr. Sanders boasted of having 200,000 donors already, showing the grassroots support that he is generating. According to ActBlue filings through June 17, 93 percent of the $8.3 million that he has raised online came from donations of less than $1,000. Meanwhile, Hillary Rodham Clinton is using a two-pronged approach to increase her fund-raising numbers. In an email to supporters she warned that her opponents were “counting on a flood of secret, unregulated donations” to defeat her before saying, “but Iâm counting on you.” Mrs. Clinton also took to Twitter to plug her campaign store, suggesting that her backers pick up a $10 two-pack of Chillary Clinton Koozies to keep their sodas cool.
