Rick Perry’s scuffling presidential bid has suffered another blow. The chairman of his campaign in Iowa, Sam Clovis, is leaving the campaign, Mr. Perry’s team said on Monday. Despite the departure, Mr. Perry, a former governor of Texas, still plans to campaign in the crucial caucus state, a spokeswoman said. “Governor Perry remains committed to competing in Iowa, as well as South Carolina and New Hampshire, and there are many people across the country who continue to work to elect Rick Perry as president,” the spokeswoman, Lucy Neshad, said. “We wish Sam the best in his next endeavor.” The loss of a major operative, which was first reported by The Associated Press, comes as Mr. Perry has been struggling to raise money and has cut staff in key states.  Failing to register in many polls, Mr. Perry raised just $1 million by the end of June and is increasingly relying on his “super PAC” to support his candidacy. He failed to qualify for the Republican prime-time debate this month and risks failing to do so again for the second debate, to be hosted by CNN next month.
