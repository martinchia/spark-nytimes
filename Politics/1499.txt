The Trump feud with Fox News has entered its dÃ©jÃ  vu phase. After a day of feisty back and forth between the real estate mogul and the cable news network on Wednesday, Donald J. Trump and Roger Ailes, the network’s chairman and chief executive, spoke on the phone Thursday morning, the network said in a statement, and “plan to have a meeting next week to discuss their differences of opinion regarding Fox’s coverage of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign.”  “Ailes will be joined by senior Fox editorial executives,” the network said. “Mr. Trump believes he has been treated unfairly in certain instances. Fox News has held every candidate in this race to the highest journalistic standards throughout our coverage. We believe a candid meeting about our differences is required and that any misunderstandings can be handled without compromising those standards.” If the situation sounds familiar, that’s because it is. After the first Republican debate last month, hosted by Fox News, Mr. Trump lashed out at the network and one of the debate moderators, Megyn Kelly, for what he said were unfair questions. But shortly after, Mr. Ailes and Mr. Trump spoke on the phone and seemed to smooth over their differences. In the latest dispute, Fox News canceled Mr. Trump’s scheduled appearance on “The O’Reilly Factor” on Wednesday, after he began criticizing the network on Twitter.
