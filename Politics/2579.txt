Seeking to appeal to the more liberal wing of the Democratic Party, Martin O’Malley unveiled a plan for debt-free college education on Wednesday as he campaigned in New Hampshire, staking out ground on a major policy debate before Hillary Rodham Clinton, his main rival for the party’s presidential nomination. Mr. O’Malley’s plan — to make college free of debt for all, as well as enhancing public education systems — won praise from the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is closely aligned with Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat and a champion of the left. The committee had stirred up interest in the issue of debt-free college over many months, and officials with the group suggested that Mr. O’Malley met all six of its criteria for what it called a workable plan.  Among Mr. O’Malley’s proposals are restructuring student aid and pools of money spent on education in the states. He wants public colleges and universities to freeze tuition, and to let families restructure student debt at lower interest rates, with loan repayments based on income levels after a student leaves college. “Martin O’Malley’s belief that debt-free college must be accessible to all students, and must apply to all public colleges and universities, is spot on — and we look forward to seeing the plans of others,” said Adam Green, who co-founded the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, and described debt-free college as crucial to “what our economy needs to grow.”  While Mr. Green noted that Mrs. Clinton had also discussed the issue on the campaign trail, she had said she would lay out her policy proposals in the coming weeks.  Mr. O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland, has been struggling to gain traction in polls as Bernie Sanders, the senator from Vermont, corrals the support of more liberal voters who had hoped Mrs. Warren would run for president.  The challenge of solving the growing student debt burden has been a major issue since the 2008 economic recession. In New Hampshire, debt burden for students is said to be particularly high.  Asked about Mr. O’Malley’s plan as he campaigned in New Hampshire, Jeb Bush, a Republican contender, told NH1 News that such a plan was akin to just wiping âthe 1.2 trillion dollars of debt without reforming our higher education system — more free stuff.” “I think the focus ought to be on how we reform higher education so that full-time students can get a four-year degree in four years,” Mr. Bush said, “and theyâll be able to access a job because weâll have a higher growth economy than the one that heâs probably proposing.â The Democratic National Committee instantly seized on Mr. Bush’s use of the phrase “free stuff,” in an attempt to make him appear out of touch with the concerns of middle-class Americans.
