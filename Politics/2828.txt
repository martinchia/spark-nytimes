Who in Trumpland really sent The Tweet? That is the question now fluttering around the Internet after Donald J. Trump said a campaign intern had sent a Twitter post that mocked Iowans — and then another intern on his campaign suggested that was not plausible. The Twitter tempest started when the popular Twitter account of Mr. Trump, who fell behind Ben Carson in polls of Iowans this week, retweeted a fan who playfully suggested that Iowans had brain impairments because of the corn they eat —  a no-no for any presidential candidate seeking to win over the state. #BenCarson is now leading in the #polls in #Iowa… Too much #Monsanto in the #corn creates issues in the brain? @realDonaldTrump #GOP — Nicolas R-V (@mygreenhippo) October 22, 2015  But it’s unclear whether campaign interns actually have access to Mr. Trump’s Twitter account. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Mr. Trump said that he himself tapped out many of his tweets and dictated the rest to his assistant and his head of social media. Neither are interns. But a campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said that an intern was among those who controlled Mr. Trump’s Twitter profile while he was on the road. âThere are a handful of people, including an intern, who have access to Mr. Trumpâs Twitter account,â she said. On Friday, the digital news company International Business Times quoted what it said was a Trump campaign intern who said that neither he nor his fellow interns had the ability to use the candidate’s account, casting doubt on Mr. Trump’s explanation. “As an intern for the internal headquarters campaign, we do not manage or in that case have any access to Mr. Trump’s personal Twitter,” the intern, identified as Garrison Groeschke, told the Business Times, which said that Mr. Groeschke’s personal website and LinkedIn profile listed him as a 2016 Trump intern.
