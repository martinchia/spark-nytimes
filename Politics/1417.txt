Donald J. Trump is not letting political correctness get in the way of saying what he really thinks about Carly Fiorina‘s looks. The billionaire tycoon offered a free-wheeling critique of some of his rivals for the Republican presidential nomination in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine. His impression of Mrs. Fiorina’s appearance was less than flattering. “Look at that face!” he said at a conference table with his staff as Mrs. Fiorina took a question about him on television. “Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!” Mr. Trump’s has faced criticism over the years for saying sexist things about women, referring them as pigs or worse. That history was highlighted after his public feud with Fox News’s Megyn Kelly, which culminated with him suggesting that the journalist had blood coming out of her eyes and “blood coming out of her wherever.” Mr. Trump seemed to realize that he was going too far in his assessment of Ms. Fiorina, but he opted not to restrain himself. “I mean, she’s a woman, and I’m not s’posedta say bad things, but really, folks, come on,” he said, according to the report. “Are we serious?” Speaking to Ms. Kelly about the remarks, Mrs. Fiorina suggested that Mr. Trump was getting nervous that she was gaining ground on him. “Maybe, just maybe, I’m getting under his skin a little bit because I am climbing in the polls,” she said. Mr. Trump dismissed the remark as a jocular moment in his own interview with Fox and said he was referring to Mrs. Fiorina’s persona, not her face.
