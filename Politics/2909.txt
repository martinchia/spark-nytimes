The granddaughter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt assailed Donald J. Trump on Thursday for citing internment camps set up by the Roosevelt administration in defending his proposal to ban foreign Muslims from entering the United States. âFor Donald Trump to cite my grandfather and internment as a defense of his own intolerant and divisive agenda is reprehensible,â said Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, chairwoman of the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank in New York.  âJapanese-Americans, who were loyal citizens and who served bravely in the U.S. military, were scarred not only by the physical deprivation of internment but by the denial of the dignity and respect of their own country,” she said. “As a nation, internment weakened us all. It is a tragic reminder of what happens when we allow fear and hysteria to trump our values.â In 1942, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, officials sent thousands of people of Japanese, Italian and German descent to live in camps around the country as a way to protect the nation from potential sabotage. Mr. Trump has said he is not endorsing a policy as far-reaching as internment camps. However, in an interview with MSNBC defending his proposed ban on Muslims entering the country, he referred to three proclamations by Roosevelt labeling Germans, Italians and Japanese âenemy aliensâ who could be detained in the United States, leading to internment. Ms. Roosevelt said the World War II internment camps were a sad part of history and a terrible political decision driven by fear. She said that her grandmother, Eleanor, spoke out against the internment. âHistorians and leaders across the political spectrum agree internment was a grievous mistake and a violation of basic human rights,â Ms. Roosevelt said. âInternment was wrong then, and any effort to discriminate against a group of people based on their race or religion is wrong today.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
