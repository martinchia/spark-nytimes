Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016’s first proper bus tour. EVENT 2 Time: 1:05 p.m., Jan. 4 Place: Carroll, Iowa (population: 10,103) Site: Charlieâs Steakhouse, an airy space with booths and a rounded bar. Food: Billybobâs beef brisket, hot-to-trot burger, drunken ribeye T-shirt mounted to wall: âOur Meat Canât Be Beatâ Mood: Lunchtime casual. Sound effects: A cowbell, deployed by a supporter after applause lines. Highlight: As Mr. Cruz began his speech, his microphone cut out. âApparently the Obama N.S.A. has tried to shut us down,â he said to laughs. The technology rebounded briefly, but moments later, as Mr. Cruz recited the Obama-era policies he would reverse, the sound faded again. âMr. President?â the senator said into the malfunctioning microphone.
