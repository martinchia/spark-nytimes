A day before the Michigan primary on Tuesday, Senator Bernie Sanders will be the focus of a live one-hour, prime-time event in Detroit. The host? Fox News. Bret Baier announced on his âSpecial Reportâ show on Thursday night that the Sanders campaign had agreed to the town-hall-style broadcast. The Clinton campaign was invited, but âis unable to attend due to a conflict in her campaign schedule,â according to a release from the network. While Mr. Sanders’s appearance on Fox News isnât necessarily out of the ordinary â he sat for an interview with Chris Wallace in February on âFox News Sundayâ â the network’s decision to host a Democratic town hall is notable, given that it hasn’t put on a Democratic debate since 2004. Last month, Mr. Baier pressed Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, to let Fox News host a debate. She laughed at the prospect, giving little hope that such an event would ever take place.  âThere arenât a whole lot of Democrats who come on, and I always look forward to our conversations, Bret, look forward to sparring with you and some of your hosts all the way through the campaign,â Ms. Schultz said to Mr. Baier. In his interview with Mr. Wallace, however, Mr. Sanders said he wasnât opposed to the idea of a Fox town hall. âIf we were clear to understand what the guidelines were and what the rules were and to make sure that they were fair and the D.N.C. was in favor of it, I would have no objection,â Mr. Sanders said. The town hall with Mr. Sanders will be broadcast at 6 p.m., Eastern time.
