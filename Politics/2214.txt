His political platform is based largely on his business acumen, but Donald J. Trump is making a habit of rankling the business world with his ideas on trade and taxes. On Wednesday, the conservative Club for Growth took issue with Mr. Trump’s proposal to increase taxes on companies such as Ford when they source parts or make cars in countries like Mexico. The billionaire real estate developer suggested imposing a 35 percent tax on the carmaker as a penalty for such behavior. “It should thrill liberals and Democrats everywhere that Trump wants to create new taxes and start a trade war to force American companies to work where he demands,” said David McIntosh, president of the Club for Growth. âInstead of lowering corporate taxes, cutting unnecessary regulations and fostering a more profitable environment in the U.S., as some Republican candidates have proposed, Trump wants to unilaterally threaten a major U.S. manufacturer with higher taxes.” Mr. Trump has also been critical of hedge fund managers and the favorable tax treatment they receive. Calling them “paper pushers” who he says often just get lucky in making their money, Mr. Trump said last weekend that their taxes should be higher while the middle class should have their taxes reduced.  Hedge funds are not the only business groups that Mr. Trump has singled out. This month he lamented corporate “inversions” — when an American company acquires an international company so  it can relocate its headquarters to a country with a lower tax rate.  “They have no loyalty to this country,” Mr. Trump told NBC. “And we have to do something.” While Democrats often criticize rich investors for taking advantage of tax loopholes, Republicans have tended to protect those benefits over the years, arguing that they stimulate investment, which benefits the overall economy. Taking a different approach, Mr. Trump has shown resistance to international trade deals and has struck a confrontational tone with Mexico, one of the United States’ largest trading partners. This week, Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker said  that developing economic bonds with Mexico would be more helpful than the intense focus on border security for creating jobs in both countries.
