                                        CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- On Wednesday night, one former Democratic president, Bill Clinton, will appear before the convention here in a live prime-time speech, an event that is being billed as second in importance only to President Obama&apos;s speech itself.
                                         
                                        But there is another living Democratic president: Jimmy Carter. And he was given a role with a decidedly lower profile in this convention.  
                                        Mr. Carter spoke around 7:30 p.m. Tuesday to a hall where there were large areas of empty seats. Not that Mr. Carter would have noticed: his appearance came in a videotaped address to the delegates.  
                                        And no wonder. Critics have often invoked comparisons to Mr. Carter in trying to portray Mr. Obama as a weak chief executive. Mr. Carter had barely left the stage, or rather the screen, before Mr. Romney&apos;s campaign had weighed in on his appearance,
