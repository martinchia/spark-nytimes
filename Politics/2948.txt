Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will meet today with black pastors and leaders in Baltimore, and will tour the neighborhood where the death of a young black man in police custody this year sparked riots. Mr. Sanders will visit the Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood, where Freddie Gray was arrested on April 19 and put in the back of a police van where he sustained injuries in transit that he would die from. The unrest after his death turned into destructive protests that lasted over two weeks and prompted a state of emergency to be declared.  After touring the neighborhood, Mr. Sanders will attend an âEcumenical Roundtable Discussionâ at the Freddie Gray Empowerment Center, where faith leaders and social justice advocates will discuss police tactics, economic inequality and other issues that affect African-Americans. In a statement, the Sanders campaign said the event would highlight his âposition on issues pertaining to aggressive policing, mass incarceration, racial profiling, housing, economic development and education.â In August, Mr. Sanders faced criticism and protests from the Black Lives Matter movement, and at a rally in Seattle, protesters took the stage and microphone as Mr. Sanders stood silently nearby.  âThe biggest grass-roots movement in this country right now is Black Lives Matter,â one of the activists said at the rally. Organizers canceled the Seattle event midway through, and Mr. Sanders never spoke.
