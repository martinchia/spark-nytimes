For presidential candidates, the killing of nine churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., turned into a litmus test on the Confederate flag over the weekend. As the campaigns gather pace, debate over whether the Civil War-era symbol should still fly is expected to linger. Democrats such as Hillary Rodham Clinton and Martin O’Malley have made clear that they think the flag is inappropriate. Most Republicans have indicated that it is a state matter, while hinting that they would not be sorry to see it taken down in South Carolina. The following is a compilation of what some of the White House hopefuls have had to say so far. Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida: âMy position on how to address the Confederate flag is clear. In Florida, we acted, moving the flag from the state grounds to a museum where it belonged.â Hillary Clinton in 2007: “I think about how many South Carolinians have served in our military and who are serving today under our flag and I believe that we should have one flag that we all pay honor to, as I know that most people in South Carolina do every single day.” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas: âI understand the passions that this debate evokes on both sides. Both those who see a history of racial oppression and a history of slavery, which is the original sin of our nation. And we fought a bloody civil war to expunge that sin. But I also understand those who want to remember the sacrifices of their ancestors and the traditions of their states â not the racial oppression, but the historical traditions. And I think often this issue is used as a wedge to try to divide people.â Senator Marco Rubio of Florida: “Ultimately the people of South Carolina will make the right decision for South Carolina, and I believe in their capacity to make that decision. The next president of the United States will not make that decision. Thatâs up for the people of South Carolina to make, and I think theyâll make the right one like theyâve made them in the past.â Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin: “I think they’re going to have a good healthy debate and should have that debate in South Carolina amongst officials at the state level. I just think before I or anyone else weighs in on anything to do with policy, whether it’s this or any other policy decisions, we should honor the dead and the families by allowing them to bury their loved ones. And then you could perfectly ask me that question at some point in the next week or two when that’s done.” Former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland: “Is it really too much to ask the state government officials of South Carolina to retire the Confederate flag to a museum?â Former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas: âI think a governorâs job should be one to bring people together, not to divide them, and I think the Confederate battle flag is clearly one of those that divides people.â Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania: “I take the position that the federal government really has no role in determining what the states are going to do. I would say that these are decisions that should be made by â by people â you know, I don’t think the federal government or federal candidates should be making decisions on everything and â and opining on everything. This is a decision that needs to be made here in South Carolina. I have â like everybody else, I have my opinion.” Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas: “If the state government of South Carolina wishes to address an issue in their state, that’s fine. But … if you can point me to an article and section of the Constitution in which a United States president ought to weigh in on what states use as symbols, then please refresh my memory on that. But for those of us running for president, everyone’s being baited with this question as if somehow that has anything to do whatsoever with running for president. And my position is, it most certainly does not.” Ben Carson: “The Confederate flag causes a lot of people angst and they are not able to see beyond that. I think the people of South Carolina should sit down and have an intelligent discussion about what can they use that captures their heritage, captures the heritage of America and allows them to coexist in peace.” Carly Fiorina: “I think it’s clearly a symbol that is very offensive to many, but my personal opinion is not what’s relevant here. What’s relevant here is what the people of South Carolina choose to do next.” Follow the New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.
