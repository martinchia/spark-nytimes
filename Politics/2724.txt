BEDFORD, N.H. â The man who stood at Jeb Bush’s rally here Saturday morning had not a question but a comment. A metaphor, really.  About a boxing match. That took place more than three decades ago. The voter, no fan of Donald J. Trump, said that with yet another Republican debate looming Saturday night, he couldn’t help but think of the famous boxing match in 1980 in which Mike Weaver  faced off against John Tate for the W.B.A. heavyweight championship. Mr. Tate had dominated the first ten rounds, leaving Mr. Weaver battered, bruised and against the ropes. But then, in the 15th round, Mr. Weaver reared back, dropping his opponent to the mat out with a single left hook â a knockout blow for the win.  “You’re Mike Weaver,” the man told Mr. Bush, imploring him: “Throw that punch tonight.”
