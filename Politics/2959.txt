Donald J. Trump has unveiled his first ads of the 2016 presidential cycle, radio spots that will air over the next two weeks in the first three voting states â Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.  The ads were posted to his website on Tuesday morning.  One ad, completely narrated by Mr. Trump, is like a 60-second condensed and speed-read version of the candidate’s often meandering stump speech.  It promises “the greatest trade deals we ever made in our country,” bringing jobs back, taking care of veterans and making our military “so strong that no one will mess with us,” that we “will have a wall,” protecting the Second Amendment and repealing President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.  The two ads do not attack any of his Republican rivals, or even his Democratic ones, by name, but they do feature a broadside attack. “Politicians are all talk, no action,” Mr. Trump says. “My opponents have no experience in creating jobs or making deals.” The second ad features a female voice as the narrator, and touches on many of the similar parts of Mr. Trump’s platform as his own voiced ad does.  “It’s time to make America great again, maybe greater than ever before,” the ad concludes.
