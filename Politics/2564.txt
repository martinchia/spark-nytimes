Theirs is a tale of two star-crossed New Jerseyans: a rock-and-roll hall-of-famer with a decidedly leftist political bent, and one of his most passionate fans — who is also the stateâs Republican leader. Gov. Chris Christie has given Bruce Springsteen nothing short of his wholehearted adoration (not to mention the time and money required to attend more than 120 concerts). Mr. Springsteen has responded, with the rarest of exceptions, with reluctance and the occasional dismissal. But even the most devoted follower can have a change of heart. In a videotaped interview, when asked to choose between Mr. Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi, also from New Jersey, Mr. Christie and his wife, Mary Pat, both picked Mr. Bon Jovi without hesitation. The interview was published on LifeZette, a website started recently by the conservative commentator Laura Ingraham. 

  A year ago, Mr. Christie was still playing up his relationship with Mr. Springsteen, telling a woman at a town-hall-style meeting that he spoke frequently with the musician and that they were friends. But Mr. Bon Jovi has permitted Mr. Christie to play his music on the campaign trail. And Mr. Christieâs entry into the presidential campaign on June 30 practically came with a Bon Jovi soundtrack. Though the governor and Mr. Springsteen embraced after Hurricane Sandy â an event that caused Mr. Christie to weep afterwardÂ â Mr. Springsteen poked fun at Mr. Christieâs struggles on national television during the scandal over the closing of traffic lanes on the George Washington Bridge. It was impossible to know, however, just what Mr. Christie had in mind in spurning Mr. Springsteen in the new interview, which was first noticed by Matt Katz of NPR: The format did not allow for a follow-up question.
