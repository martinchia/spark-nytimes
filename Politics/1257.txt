Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday urged the United States to lead the effort in assisting and resettling the millions of Syrian migrants who have fled to Europe and elsewhere to escape the civil war ravaging their country.  “The United States must lead in assisting those who have been uprooted by conflict,” Mrs. Clinton said in an address about the Iranian nuclear agreement in Washington. ” As Pope Francis has reminded us, this is an international problem that demands an international response â and the United States must help lead that response,” she continued. “Thatâs who we are, and thatâs what we do.” Mrs. Clinton also urged other nations to take in the migrants who have flooded European borders in recent weeks and captivated the world with images of desperation and hopelessness. “There should be an emergency global gathering where the U.N. literally tries to get commitments,” she said. “I obviously want the United States to do our part.” Amid a wave of anxiety about immigration on the right, Marco Rubio, the Republican senator from Florida who is also running for president, was criticized by his party this week after he said the United States should be more open to accepting Syrian migrants.  “We’ve always been a country that’s been willing to accept people who have been displaced,” Mr. Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, told Boston Herald radio. “I think overwhelmingly, the vast and overwhelming majority of people that are seeking refuge are not terrorists.” Mrs. Clinton has been cautious to say that the United States should help but that it should not bear an inordinate responsibility. In an editorial in USA Today on Wednesday, Martin O’Malley, the former governor of Maryland who is also seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, called for the country to accept 65,000 Syrian refugees. “Americans are a generous and compassionate people,” he wrote. “But our policies are falling short of our values.” Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
