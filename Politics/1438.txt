Hillary Rodham Clinton will hold the first major rally of her presidential campaign on June 13 on Roosevelt Island in New York City, before embarking on a five-day swing through the four states with the earliest Democratic nominating contests, her campaign said on Monday. In a midday speech at Four Freedoms Park â a memorial to Franklin D. Roosevelt, for whom the East River island is named â Mrs. Clinton will sketch out her view of the problems facing the nation and her “vision and ideas” for how to move the country forward, a top spokesman, Jesse Ferguson, said in an email to reporters that also noted Mrs. Clinton’s admiration for both F.D.R. and Eleanor Roosevelt. From New York, she will travel to Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. In the email, Mr. Ferguson also sought to lower expectations for Mrs. Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire. He noted that no Democratic candidate had won more than 50 percent of the Iowa caucus who was not a sitting president, vice president or Iowa senator; and that no Democrat had received more than 50 percent of the vote in a contested New Hampshire primary in the last 25 years.
