Like the 15 other Republicans running for president, Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio â who is expected to announce his candidacy on Tuesday â knows it takes guts, and even a little chutzpah, to make it to the White House. Itâs a lesson he learned 45 years ago when, as an 18-year-old freshman at Ohio State University, he begged President Richard M. Nixon to let him visit. âI think that you, as far as I can judge, are not only a great president but an even greater person,” Mr. Kasich wrote, in neat cursive, in a letter dated Dec. 2, 1970. The letter, on file with Mr. Kasichâs papers at the Westerville Public Library in Ohio, was hand-delivered by the president of Ohio State, Novice Fawcett. âWould it be possible,â the young Mr. Kasich continued, âfor me to come to the White House to talk and see you sometime in the future? I would immediately pass up a Rose Bowl trip to see you. My parents would permit me to fly down anytime, and I know my grades wouldnât suffer.” Mr. Kasich went on to predict, correctly, “a big Nixon victory in â72.” Flattery worked; Mr. Nixon wrote back and on Dec. 22, 1970, the young Mr. Kasich spent 20 minutes with Mr. Nixon in the Oval Office, according to a White House schedule. âI donât really remember that visit,” Mr. Kasich said Friday when asked in an interview what they talked about. But the governor (and aspiring White House occupant) does recall one thing about his time in the Oval Office: âI remember them telling me I was going to get, like five minutes,” he said. âAnd I thought that was a ridiculously short time.”
