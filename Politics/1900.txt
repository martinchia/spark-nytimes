Good Monday morning. Pope Francis has delivered an encyclical calling for increased action against climate change, denounced the role of global capitalism in increasing poverty, and enthusiastically supported the new nuclear accord withÂ Iran, positions thatÂ have caused tensions in the Republican Party. Now the pope, whom American Catholics overwhelmingly support, arrives in the United States as Republicans wrestle with these issues and with perceptions of intolerance. The pope visits Washington this week, presumably bringing the message of tolerance that he has espoused throughout his tenure, including in the face of extremism. Yet this week in the race to replace President Obama began with one of the top Republican presidential hopefuls, Ben Carson, suggesting that having a Muslim president would be a bridge too far and that it wasnât a concept he was comfortable with. Not one of the presidential candidates is Muslim. But questions about tolerance of Muslims arose last week, when an attendee at a rally for Donald J. Trump insisted that Mr. Obama, who is Christian and was born in Hawaii, was a Muslim who was not an American. Then the attendee asked when the country could be rid of Muslims. Mr. Trump did not correct the questioner and said he was looking into the issue. Mr. Trump has since defended himself on Twitter and elsewhere, and told CNN over the weekend, âI love the Muslims.â But Mr. Trump, who called his supporters âpassionateâ after two men accused of beating a homeless man cited his caustic words on immigration, has also said he has no moral obligation to correct other people. While Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida distanced themselves on Sunday from Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump, the tenor of the debate seems to have reached a new level in a race where resentment over demographic changes has led to a romanticizing of the dwindling white working class comprising the Republican base. The popeâs visit has the potential to stand in stark contrast to the discourse of the 2016 race. And it could refocus the political discussion, as anger among voters seems poised at times to boil over. â Maggie Haberman What We’re Watching â In keeping with âthe late shows are the new Sunday talk showsâ trend, candidates continue to seek out the company of comedians, as Mr. Cruz and Mr. TrumpÂ are scheduled to visit the “Late Show With Stephen Colbert,â  and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio will appear on the âLate Night With Seth Meyersâ show. â Fresh off her success in the second Republican debate last week, Carly Fiorina will spend most of the week in South Carolina. âÂ And Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, whose drop in the polls has his campaign refocusing on Iowa, will be in Indiana, New Hampshire, New York and Washington, D.C. Some Barbs Lay Under Full Trappings of Chinese Leaderâs State Visit For President Xi Jinping of China, the red carpet that Mr. Obama is rolling out this week comes with some sharp edges. Mr. Obama will welcome Mr. Xi to the White House on Friday with all the fanfare and protocol that comes with a formal state visit: an arrival ceremony on the South Lawn, a joint news conference in the Rose Garden and an elaborate state dinner. But at a private working dinner at Blair House on Thursday night and in closed-door meetings between carefully staged photo opportunities the next day, the two men will discuss an agenda that features some prominent disagreements, including over cybersecurity and Chinaâs activities in the South China Sea. The two have long been at odds over Chinese cyberintrusions, most recently the theft of 22 million security dossiers of federal employees held by the Office of Personnel Management. Officials say some sort of cyberaccord is in the works, but even if one is reached, it is unlikely to address some of the most egregious activities, such as intellectual property theft and espionage. Mr. Obama is also prepared to scold Mr. Xi about his activities in the South China Sea, where the Chinese are reclaiming contested territory and building on some submerged islands and reefs â steps that American officials argue are provocative and yield to maritime disputes in the region. Still, the two presidents have some areas of commonality, which they are likely to emphasize. Officials hope to show concrete progress in putting into effect a climate change agreement they struck last year, when it was Mr. Xi rolling out the red carpet for Mr. Obama in Beijing. â Julie Hirschfeld Davis Our Favorites From The Times âÂ  The same day Hillary Rodham Clinton called upon the White House to accept more Syrian migrants,Â Secretary of StateÂ John KerryÂ saidÂ that the Obama administration would raise the number of migrants the United States is willing to accept in 2017 to 100,000, a significant increase over the current annual worldwide cap of 70,000. â Â Mrs.Â Fiorina has prepared to counter accusations that she mismanaged Hewlett-Packard and callously laid off workers â the kind of criticism that hurt her in a 2010 Senate race. â Â And newly disclosed information sheds light on a Bush administration fight in March 2004 about the post-9/11 surveillance and data collection program. — Pope Francis arrives in Washington on Tuesday for a series of events, and leaders from both parties say it is difficultÂ to place him on an American political spectrum. — A rough political summer has left Hillary Rodham Clinton with negative favorability ratings in a New York state poll for the first time, a low mark in the state she represented as a senator for eight years. Congress Faces a Busy Week as a Unicameral Body Time is running out on the fiscal year. Pope Francis arrives on Tuesday. Mr. Xi follows him. It is one of the biggest weeks of the year in Washington, and the House of Representatives wonât be around for most of it. With funding for the federal government running out in 10 days, the House is not scheduled to be in session until Francis addresses Congress on Thursday. The House was initially set to be out for the entire week because of the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur, but Speaker John A. Boehner readjusted the schedule to accommodate the pope and to make it possible for him to speak at the Capitol. The Houseâs absence hands the stage to the Senate, which is set to consider a ban on abortions after 20 weeks. Most Democrats oppose the legislation, and it will be blocked by a filibuster. The Senate will then have to begin moving toward the passage of some sort of temporary funding measure if it hopes to clear all the possible procedural hurdles by Sept. 30, when the budget runs out. Republican leaders do enjoy one benefit of the Houseâs being out of town. With members scattered, it makes it harder for rebellious lawmakers to gather and plot ways to derail the leadershipâs strategy for avoiding a shutdown. â Carl Hulse What We’re Reading Elsewhere âÂ VoxÂ takes a lookÂ at why, even asÂ Mr. SandersÂ takes the lead in some polls and as Vice President Joseph R.Â Biden Jr.Â hovers as a perpetual alternative,Â Mrs. ClintonÂ continues to secure crucial endorsements. âÂ NBC News reports thatÂ Jill Biden is fully behindÂ her husband if he decides to seek another run for the presidency. â AndÂ The Washington Post saysÂ that amid increasing calls for a more active debate schedule, âDemocrats â and, specifically, Hillary Clinton â have a growing debate problem on their hands.â Paul Acknowledges the Toil of Life on the Trail Crisscrossing the country to run for president is not for the faint of heart, and even the heartiest of candidates can get worn out. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky acknowledged as much at a gathering of Republicans on Mackinac Island in Michigan last weekend. âItâs a lot of travel,â Mr. Paul said in an interview at a âlibertyâ Lego exhibit on the resort. âIâve been on the road six or seven days now, so it is draining, somewhat, to be on the road so much.â Mr. Paul, a Republican, comes from a political family, but campaigning has never been one of his favorite activities. If only he could be in two places at once, he surmised, the process might be a bit more enjoyable. âIâve jokingly said that if you could somehow have a teleporter, like in âStar Trek,â where you could sort of be a hologram and vaporize and appear somewhere and then could instantaneously be back home, it would be easier.â While the demands of running for president, running for re-election in Kentucky and tending to his duties in the Senate can be daunting, Mr. Paul knows how to flip the switch. He posed for dozens of âselfies,â and led a crowd of young Republicans chanting âPresident Paulâ to the Grand Hotel where he gave a rousing keynote address. Still, it was clear that for Mr. Paul, who won the Mackinac straw poll, the road warrior routine was wearing thin. âThis is not my first political dinner,â Mr. Paul said at the top of his speech. âIt seems like I get in the car and go to a dinner, and then I get in the car again and go to another dinner. I spend most of my day eating.â â Alan Rappeport
