Raising the possibility that Hillary Rodham Clinton could lose both the first two nominating contests, Senator Bernie Sanders has taken a narrow lead in Iowa for the first time in a Democratic poll released Thursday. Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator, led 41 percent to 40 percent among likely Democratic caucusgoers, a statistical tie, but a significant reversal for Mrs. Clinton, who as recently as July held a 19-point advantage in a survey by the same pollster, Quinnipiac University.   Mr. Sanders has ridden a summer of discontent in both Iowa and New Hampshire by liberal voters angry about income inequality and big money in politics. Mrs. Clinton has been distracted by questions about her use of a private email account as secretary of state. Although state polls five months before the first votes are cast are historically inaccurate, for the Clinton campaign there is a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu all over again. In her first presidential race in 2008, Mrs. Clinton’s sense of inevitability eroded in Iowa before an insurgent candidate named Barack Obama.  Mr. Sanders, who leads Mrs. Clinton in New Hampshire but trails her by double digits in national polls, has captured the enthusiasm of the more ideologically driven voters who predominate in the first two nominating states.  “He is the candidate of the Democratic left, against his own party’s bosses and their prized presidential candidate,” Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac Poll, said in a statement. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is undecided about entering the race, had 12 percent of supporters, and former Gov. Martin OâMalley of Maryland, who has struggled to break through despite frequent trips to Iowa, was at 3 percent.  Recently the Clinton campaign has been looking past Iowa and New Hampshire to a political firewall of Southern states that vote in March, where she has the solid support of black and Hispanic voters. Asked recently if he was prepared to lose Iowa, Mrs. Clintonâs state director, Matt Paul, said he was continuing to build an extensive organizing team in the state, which Mrs. Clintonâs national staff has long envisioned as a bulwark against a repeat of her 2008 defeat there. âWeâre focused day by day on Feb. 1 and working very hard to build an organization and to build a campaign that is successful,ââ Mr. Paul said.
