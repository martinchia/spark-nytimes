Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has been an outspoken opponent of what he calls “Republican-on-Republican violence,” and has promised not to âengage in the media’s game of throwing rocks and attacking other Republicans.â But now, he seems to be willing to criticize his Republican rivals for president, so long as he says something nice first. During an interview recorded on Wednesday with Al Hunt for PBS, Mr. Cruz said Jeb Bush was someone âwho I like, who I respect.â Then he questioned his conservative credentials. âI think the policy positions heâs staking out, whether it is embracing amnesty, whether it is embracing Common Core, are not conservative positions,â Mr. Cruz said. âI think they are in direct conflict with the views of most Republicans.â   He also criticized Mr. Bushâs response to the Supreme Courtâs decision on same-sex marriage, saying it âwas almost word for word what Barack Obama said.â For Senator Marco Rubio, someone whom Mr. Cruz has worked with before in the Senate, he had equally pleasant initial things to say: âI like and respect Marco a great deal.â But he continued to question whether Mr. Rubio had fought enough for conservative issues  and that his tenure as solicitor general of Texas gave him much stronger executive experience than Mr. Rubio. As for Donald Trump, whom he met with privately in New York City on Wednesday, he stuck to his standard line, with no criticism: âI donât express things the same way he does, but Iâm glad he is focusing on the problem of illegal immigration.â
