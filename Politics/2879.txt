Hillary Clinton on Sunday played down the clash that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, had with protesters who criticized his record on criminal justice at a campaign event last week and said that if she was elected she would work to reduce unnecessary incarcerations. Interrupted multiple times at a rally in Philadelphia, Mr. Clinton vigorously defended his 1994 crime bill as an effort to protect African-Americans who were being threatened by gang violence. He at times shouted over the protesters, suggesting that they did not want to hear the truth. He later offered a partial apology for talking over them when he was explaining his record. In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton said that her husband had a âgreat legacyâ but made clear that she would like to improve upon his record on criminal justice reform. âIf weâre going to talk about his eight years as president, we should talk about everything, and he said last summer to the N.A.A.C.P. that a lot of good things happened to try to lower crime, save lives, and all of that,â Mrs. Clinton said. âBut clearly some things happened that were not foreseen and need to be now addressed, and I think thatâs good leadership.â Mrs. Clinton recalled that during the 1990s there was a lot of fear about crime, but added that there were consequences of some of the policies put into place at the time that now must be dealt with. âOne of the consequences, in my view, is over-incarceration of people who should not have been in the criminal justice system,â she said. âThey have an addiction problem, a mental health problem, they have committed a low-level offense, a nonviolent offense. So I want to divert people from the criminal justice system and from being incarcerated.â Despite the fact that Mrs. Clinton sometimes has to answer for her husbandâs policies and for his comments on the campaign trail, she insisted on Sunday that he is an asset to her campaign. âHeâs not only a former president, heâs my husband and he does take defending and protecting me very seriously, and I appreciate that,â Mrs. Clinton said.
