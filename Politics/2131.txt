It’s a time-honored tradition that candidates head to church services around the holidays, and in this way, Donald J. Trump is adhering to convention.  The real-estate mogul will head to a Christmas Eve service at Bethesda-by-the-Sea in Palm Beach, Fla., on Thursday night, said his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks. He will be accompanied by his wife, Melania, and some of his children. The church is where the pair were married in 2005; among the several hundred guests was Hillary Clinton.   Mr. Trump is not the only Republican presidential candidate heading to church in Florida — Jeb Bush, the state’s former governor, and Marco Rubio, its junior senator, will also be attending services with their families.  Much farther north, Senator Bernie Sanders, who is Jewish, will be spending Christmas Eve with his family at home in Vermont, according to his spokesman, Michael Briggs. In Maryland, Haley Morris, a spokeswoman for Martin O’Malley, said the candidate would attend a service at the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Mary Our Queen in Baltimore.  A spokesman for Hillary Clinton did not immediately respond to questions about whether she will attend a Christmas Eve service.
