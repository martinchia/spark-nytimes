Days before Massachusetts votes in its Super Tuesday primary, a poll in the state shows Hillary Clinton with a slight edge over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, but one that is within the margin of error. On the Republican side, the poll shows Donald J. Trump way ahead of the rest of the pack. The poll, conducted by the MassINC Polling Group for WBUR, an NPR station in Boston, showed Mrs. Clinton with 47 percent of the vote to 43 percent for Mr. Sanders. The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points. âIt’s very close,â said Steve Koczela, president of MassINC. âBut Sanders would like to see Massachusetts go his way comfortably, since it should be a relatively friendly state for him. A struggle here is not a good sign for him.â  Mr. Trump was leading the Republican race in Massachusetts with 39 percent of the vote, compared with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who drew 18 percent, and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, with 17 percent. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas came in at 9 percent. The Republican poll also had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points. The poll questioned 386 Republicans likely to vote on Tuesday and 418 Democrats likely to vote. The polls were conducted from Feb. 21 to 23.
