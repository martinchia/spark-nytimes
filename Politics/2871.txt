Former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, who has explored a Democratic presidential campaign for the last two years, raised about $2 million in the month after he announced his candidacy.  The amount was reported in campaign finance filings on Wednesday that covered the second fund-raising quarter of the year, the first when Mr. O’Malley was formally a candidate.  Mr. O’Malley’s aides portrayed the dollar figure as a sign of his ability to connect with the grass roots. Yet the former governor has been heavily outpaced by another Democratic hopeful, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who raised $15 million in the filing period.  But a bigger obstacle for Mr. O’Malley, a former Democratic Governors’ Association chairman who had donor contacts around the country, is Hillary Rodham Clinton, who raised $45 million, much of it in increments of $2,700, the maximum amount allowed in the primary.  Mr. O’Malley is “the only candidate who has actually gotten results on the issues progressives care about,” his senior adviser, Bill Hyers, said in a statement.  It was not immediately clear how much has been raised for a “super PAC” created by Mr. O’Malley’s allies. The former governor is trying to sell himself as the true policy wonk of the race, and the one with the most appeal to progressives.
