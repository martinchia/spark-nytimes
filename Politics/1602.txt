Hillary Rodham Clinton raised $46.7 million for her primary campaign, more than half of it from women, according to campaign officials and reports filed on Wednesday with the Federal Election Commission. Mrs. Clinton had $28 million in cash on hand at the beginning of July after spending more than $18 million since starting her campaign in April, as she moved rapidly to establish infrastructure in key primary states after months of waiting to enter the race. And while her campaign has focused on raising contributions for the primary, Mrs. Clinton accepted $824,620 in money earmarked for the general election should she win the Democratic nomination. About one in six dollars of the almost $47 million Mrs. Clinton raised came from donors giving less than $200, a smaller proportion than some Democratic and Republican rivals, such as Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ted Cruz of Texas. Mr. Sanders raised far less than Mrs. Clinton overall â about $15 million, including money transferred from his Senate account â though more than two-thirds of it came from smaller donors. âThanks to the more than 250,000 Americans who have stepped up to support Hillary Clintonâs campaign, we have had the ability to make critical investments in our organization that will put us in position to win the primary and the White House,â Robby Mook, Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, said in a statement. âWith Republicans tapping their billionaire backers for unlimited sums of money, we are glad to be able to have such broad support to be able to show why Hillary Clinton is the only candidate who will fight for policies that allow everyday Americans to get ahead and stay ahead.â By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and MAGGIE HABERMAN Hillary Rodham Clintonâs presidential campaign has been slow to harness the fund-raising power of the Democratic Partyâs legions of grass-roots donors, according to reports filed Wednesday, a weakness that her campaign is racing to combat.
