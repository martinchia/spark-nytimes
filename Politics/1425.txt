Hillary Rodham Clinton’s supporters have their eye on Martin O’Malley.  A so-called tracker with the “super PAC” Correct the Record, which is coordinating with Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, was spotted Thursday in Iowa at an immigration-related round-table held by Mr. O’Malley, the former Maryland governor and one of Mrs. Clinton’s rivals for the Democratic nomination.  Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the super PAC, confirmed that someone monitoring Mr. O’Malley was seen at the event in Des Moines.  Asked why the tracker was there and whether the same could be expected at events held by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, another Democratic contender, Ms. Watson replied, “We’re doing our due diligence, and we’d expect others to do the same.”  While Mr. Sanders is polling the strongest against Mrs. Clinton, Mr. O’Malley has been languishing in the low double digits nationally. Each trails her in Iowa by a significant margin.
