Jeb Bush offered a concise explanation Tuesday morning of how his plan to tackle illegal immigration differs from Donald Trumpâs. His answer, prompted by a question from a member of the audience during a town hall in Englewood, Colo., is excerpted below: Mr. Trump believes you can just round people up. And that itâs an easy thing to do, âcause heâs a successful guy and heâll just have successful people do it and it will all work out. Well, the cost of this will be extraordinary. It will disrupt community life. It doesnât embrace American values that I think should be respected. Itâs not a practical plan. â¦ What Iâve proposed is for the 11 million, or whatever the number is, of undocumented workers, illegal immigrants â call them what you want â there ought to be a path to earned legal status. Where you pay a fine. You have a provisional work permit. Where you work; you donât receive federal assistance. The law doesnât allow that now. … And over an extended period of time you earn legal status. And that, I think, is the better approach, the more realistic approach to deal with this issue than to say we are just going to round people up or create conditions so harsh that they leave. … The problem with the Trump plan is that itâs not a conservative plan. It is not practical. It will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. And itâs not going to happen, either. Itâs not possible to do it. He has proposed eliminating remittances. So who is going to decide who is legally remitting money back to their families in other countries? Are we going to go door-by-door and just do this? Itâs just not practical at all. The other thing I believe is that children who came here because their parents came here illegally should have a different path. A path of earned citizenship status. Dream Act kids ought to be treated differently.
