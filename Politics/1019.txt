NEWTON, Iowa â It was a subdued Donald J. Trump who sat for a town-hall-style event focused on the middle class on Thursday here in a town where a Maytag plant closed eight years ago, throwing 1,900 people out of well-paying jobs with benefits. One former employee of the factory, Herman Couples, said: âI watched the town slowly die.ââ Mr. Trump, seated in an armchair, was asked a series of kitchen-sink questions that took him far afield from the usual topics of campaign rallies, though they were issues of concern to many of his blue-collar supporters.
