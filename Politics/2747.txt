 President Obama gave interviews at the White House on Friday to three popular YouTube figures: Adande Thorne, a self-described âvlogger, time traveler, professional cuddler and professional gamerâ who has 3.7 million subscribers and goes by the screen name sWooZie; Destin Sandlin, who hosts a show called âSmarter Every Dayâ for 3.5 million subscribers; and Ingrid Nilsen, who goes by MissGlamorazzi and hosts a channel âfor curious minds and adventurous heartsâ with 3.9 million subscribers. In addition to substantive questions about terrorism, racial bias and space research, Mr. Obama fielded some others that presidents are not often asked. Here are a few. Mr. Thorne: âIf you had to pick from one of these âStar Warsâ characters, who would you be?â Mr. Obama: âIâve got to go with Han Solo. Heâs a little bit of a rebel.â Mr. Thorne: âIf you had to pick a pair of pants for your dog, A or B?â (Holds up a chart showing one dog with pants on four legs and another with pants on just the hind legs.) Mr. Obama: âYouâve got to go with this.â (Points to the dog with pants on two legs. Then points to the other one.) âThis, I think, itâs a little too conservative. A little too much. Too much fabric.â Mr. Thorne: âIf Drake and Kendrick Lamar got in a rap battle, who do you think would win?â Mr. Obama: âGotta go with Kendrick. Iâm just saying. I think Drake is an outstanding entertainer. But Kendrick, his lyrics — his last album was outstanding. Best album, I think, last year.â Mr. Sandlin: If there were an element called Obamian, âwhat would you want the physical propertyâ to be? Mr. Obama: âI would want it to be stable. I would want it to be a catalyst, but one that didnât get too hot or too cold. And hopefully it would be one that was useful to humanity, that we could actually use and wasnât just some shiny object.â Ms. Nilsen: âRecently, I was shocked to learn that pads, tampons and other menstrual products are taxed as luxury goods in 40 states. I donât know anyone who has a period who thinks itâs a luxury.â Mr. Obama: âI think thatâs fair to say. Michelle would agree with you.â Ms. Nilsen: âBecause itâs something thatâs part of our everyday lives and is crucial to our health as women. So I want to know, why do these items continue to be taxed?â Mr. Obama: âI have to tell you, I have no idea why states would tax these as luxury items. I suspect itâs because men are making the laws when those taxes were passed.â Follow the New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.
