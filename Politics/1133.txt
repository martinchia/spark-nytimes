Senator Marco Rubio is ready for an onslaught of attacks from Jeb Bush, and ahead of Tuesday nightâs Republican presidential debate he offered a preview of the comeback that he may use should Mr. Bush go on the offensive. In a pre-emptive strike, Mr. Rubioâs campaign unveiled an advertisement on Tuesday that shows Mr. Bush showering his longtime friend with praise. Suggesting that Mr. Bushâs new criticism of Mr. Rubio, who he once mentored, is âphony,â the ad seeks to neutralize any damage that Mr. Bush might be able to inflict by using the former Florida governorâs own words against him. âIâm a huge Marco fan,â Mr. Bush said in one clip. âHeâs probably the most articulate conservative on the scene today.â During another sequence, Mr. Bush expresses pride in Mr. Rubio, lauding his hopeful and optimistic message and describing the senator as energetic and eloquent. Mr. Bush tried to go after Mr. Rubio at last monthâs debate for missing votes in the Senate. But the attempt backfired, when Mr. Rubio said that Mr. Bush was just using the advice of campaign consultants in hopes of rehabilitating his candidacy. The Times reported on Monday that the cash-rich group that is aiding Mr. Bushâs White House bid is preparing a fresh line of attacks against Mr. Rubio that will focus on his hard-line stand against abortion. However, neither Mr. Bush nor the “super PAC” backing him have yet to take on Mr. Rubio in an aggressive manner. By MAGGIE HABERMAN and MICHAEL BARBARO Seething with anger and alarmed over Mr. Rubioâs rise, aides to Mr. Bush and his allies are privately threatening attacks that will try to undercut Mr. Rubio as unaccomplished and unprepared. If he does take a tougher approach with Mr. Rubio, Mr. Bushâs risks appearing insincere and faces potential blowback from Republicans who do not want to see a rising star in the party damaged. Every donor to Right to Rise who doesn't want his money used for destructive assault on @marcorubio should call and ask for his money back. — Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) November 10, 2015  Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
