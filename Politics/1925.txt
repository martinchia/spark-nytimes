Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, who has been trying to move from a lower-tier poll standing in the Republican presidential contest, is continuing to assail Donald J. Trump ahead of Wednesday’s debate. Mr. Jindal’s latest effort comes in the form of a web video, which the governor’s campaign put on Facebook, that mocks Mr. Trump’s descriptions of his knowledge of foreign policy. It includes clips from spoof movies like “Team America,” and features Mr. Trump describing reading newspapers and seeing people talking on television. Mr. Jindal has been taking swings at Mr. Trump since last week.
