To listen to the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates describe the mass shootings in San Bernardino is to hear two separate realities. In one, the Democratic hopefuls â Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Gov. Martin OâMalley of Maryland â speak repeatedly about gun control. âNo one should have that basic sense of safety and security ripped away from them,â Mrs. Clinton said in New Hampshire on Thursday.  âThe vast majority of Americans support common-sense steps to reduce and prevent gun violence,â she added, though later in the day she said it was becoming clear that the shootings were âan act of terrorism.â Mr. OâMalley, the former governor of Maryland, and Mr. Sanders also called for changes to gun laws. It was a different reality than the one described by a number of the Republican candidates. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas best captured the sentiment at a Republican Jewish Coalition forum in Washington on Thursday morning. âAll of us are deeply concerned that this is yet another manifestation of terrorism, radical Islamic terrorism here at home,â he said. For both parties, there is a grim view of a clear and present danger. But precisely which danger depends on which candidates were talking, and which voters they hoped to reach.
