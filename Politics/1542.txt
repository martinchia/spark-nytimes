Marco Rubio of Florida criticized his Senate colleague Ted Cruz of Texas on Monday night, accusing him of being weak on national security as the presidential race takes a sharper focus on how safe Americans are from attack.  “I think it’s a distinctive issue of debate in the presidential race,” Mr. Rubio said at a forum in Washington hosted by The Wall Street Journal. He then called out Mr. Cruz by name, something he has been willing to do more and more lately as the battle for the Republican nomination narrows and the two senators climb in the polls.  “At least two of my colleagues in the Senate aspiring to the presidency, Senator Cruz in particular, have voted to weaken the U.S. intelligence programs,” Mr. Rubio continued, also referring to Rand Paul of Kentucky. Mr. Cruz voted to end the bulk data collection program. Mr. Rubio opposed those efforts.
