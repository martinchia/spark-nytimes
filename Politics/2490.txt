LAS VEGAS â Hours after the first Democratic debate wrapped up in Nevada, a state with a high share of Hispanic voters, the “super PAC” backing Hillary Rodham Clinton released its first Spanish-language digital ad, “Mi Hija” (translation: “My Daughter”), in support of her candidacy. The five-figure buy by Priorities USA will run statewide in Nevada, and features a single mother talking about how she raised her child on her own. The mother calls her daughter “my sun, my light.” “I think Hillary Clinton is a smart woman, she is a brave woman,” the mother says in Spanish, as English subtitles scrawl below. “As a mother, she knows how hard it is to go to work and raise a child.” The fast-growing Hispanic population is a critical demographic for any Democrat hoping to recreate President Obama’s coalition to victory. And the ad comes as Mrs. Clinton, in Tuesday night’s debate, repeatedly embraced her status as a woman who would make history as the first female president.
