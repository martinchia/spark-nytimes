Good Wednesday morning from Washington. Democrats are quietly counting their Iran votes, and President Obama remains on vacation, hoping things stay as unexciting as possible. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida is getting some attention for his throwing arm, while several other Republicans are heading to New Hampshire to talk education.  The Republican presidential contest will shift its debate from immigration to education policy on Wednesday, as several candidates gather in New Hampshire to discuss the future of schools. The news site The Seventy Four, which was created by former television journalist Campbell Brown, will hold a first-of-its-kind public forum featuring about a third of the extensive Republican field: Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal, Carly Fiorina, Scott Walker and John R. Kasich. The event can be viewed live. Ms. Brown has become an advocate of overhauls to the education system, including changes to the teacher evaluation systems that are part of union contracts. For Mr. Bush, education policy has been a signature issue over the last decade, and the forum gives him a chance to highlight those credentials. But within the Republican contest, education policy has become a fraught topic, particularly around the Common Core education standards. Mr. Bush favors those standards, which many conservative voters oppose. Unlike in a debate format with a 60-second response time, Mr. Bush may have more of an opportunity to explain his views. As for Mr. Christie and Mr. Walker, who both had high-profile fights with the teachers’ unions in their respective states, the format will most likely let them showcase their claims to the education battle. â Maggie Haberman Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. Donald J. Trump will hold a town-hall-style event in Derry, N.H., at 6:30 p.m. Ben Carson travels to Arizona, where he will take a helicopter tour to see smuggling routes and visit the border with local officials. Former President Bill Clinton celebrates his 69th birthday. The Federal Reserve releases minutes from its latest policy meeting. If there is a common sentiment among the White House staff members, journalists and Secret Service agents who have followed Mr. Obama and his family to Martha’s Vineyard, it is this: Don’t do anything to jinx things. For the first time in years, Mr. Obama has so far dodged anything that might interrupt his family vacation. There has been no international crisis. No domestic upheaval. No budget standoff. No looming epidemic or storm. For once, Mr. Obama has been free to golf, have long dinners with friends, take walks with his children and hang out at the beach. There have been no briefings by White House officials. There have been no on-camera presidential statements. That’s rarely been the case. In 2009, during his first trip to Martha’s Vineyard as president, Mr. Obama was forced to skip off the island to deliver a eulogy for Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who passed away on Aug. 25 that year. Mr. Obama had already interrupted his vacation once that year to reappoint Ben S. Bernanke as the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Last year, the first week of Mr. Obama’s vacation was consumed by riots in Ferguson, Mo., and the escalation of fighting against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Just days after he arrived here in 2014, Mr. Obama confirmed the beheading of James Foley, an American journalist, in a live statement from an elementary school here. The White House later announced that an earlier rescue operation had failed. This time, Mr. Obama is past the halfway mark in his vacation without a crisis. He went to the beach with his family on Tuesday and is likely to watch the island’s annual fireworks on Friday. Unless something jinxes things. â Michael D. Shear Senator Robert Menendez on Tuesday delivered a blistering critique of the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration, saying in a speech at Seton Hall University in New Jersey that “if Iran is to acquire a nuclear bomb, it will not have my name on it.” His position on the agreement was no surprise since Mr. Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, has long since telegraphed his opposition. Neither was his tone since he has clashed harshly with Mr. Obama over foreign policy issues such as Iran and the thaw with Cuba. Mr. Menendez pointedly took issue with the president’s characterization of opponents of the deal as the same lawmakers who wrongly supported the war in Iraq, “I opposed it, unlike the vice president and the secretary of state, who both supported it.” That reference was, of course, to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Secretary of State John Kerry, who both initially backed the Iraq war. Mr. Menendez also disputed the president’s claim that the alternative to the agreement was conflict with Iran, and he urged the president to reopen the talks. The question now for the administration is not how Mr. Menendez will vote, but how much he will influence the votes of other Democrats. â Carl Hulse Mr. Trump has put Republicans in a difficult position by taking such a hard line on immigration. Hillary Rodham Clinton broke ranks with Mr. Obama on the subject of drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Ocean. Text messaging â an old thing â is proving to be the next big thing in campaign politics this election cycle. In a call with donors, Mr. Walker acknowledged criticisms that he lacked passion in the first debate and said that he would spend more time taking on Washington to counter the rise of outsider candidates like Mr. Trump. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told The Des Moines Register that there was nothing “behind the curtain” when it came to Mr. Trump, and he predicted the billionaire’s political downfall. Slate looks at the Black Lives Matter movement’s focus on Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and asks: “If Sanders is the most racially progressive candidate in the race,” as his team and supporters say he is, “then why is he a target for Black Lives Matter activists, even after he addressed core concerns over police violence and criminal justice reform?” Philip Bump at The Washington Post argues that ending birthright citizenship, as Mr. Trump said he would do and as Mr. Walker suggested he wanted to do, would be “nearly impossible.” Eli Stokols of Politico details Mr. Rubio‘s slow and steady approach in Iowa. After her strong performance at the “kiddie table” debate this month, Ms. Fiorina is polling strongly enough to possibly earn a spot on the main debate stage next month, knocking off Mr. Christie, at least according to the latest surveys, Politico reports. Mr. Rubio may have found a way to steal some of the attention that has been lavished on Mr. Trump in recent weeks: hit a child in the face with a football. Mr. Rubio’s throw was the talk of Twitter on Tuesday after a video emerged of him tossing spiral to a young Iowan this week. The boy overran the pass, and the ball collided with his nose. The dropped ball unleashed a flurry of commentary about Mr. Rubio’s throwing form, and even some suggestions that he send a Hail Mary pass in Mrs. Clinton’s direction. The child recovered from the incident, and the Rubio campaign, always happy to make lemonade from a lemon, managed to squeeze a fund-raising opportunity out of it.
