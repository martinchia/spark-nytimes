Democrats will continue their push on Wednesday to fill the Supreme Court vacancy after being handed a new cudgel on Tuesday by the court itself. The court’s 4-to-4 tie on an important labor case gave Democrats a rare double win. Not only did they get to celebrate the union win made possible by the outcome, it also provided a high-profile opportunity to remind Americans that the stalemate over the vacancy will limit the court’s ability to act â even though the failure to do so in this case played to the Democrats’ advantage. “Todayâs decision also highlights that the Supreme Court is dealing with critical issues that impact the lives of millions of Americans â we must have a full Supreme Court,” the former governor of Ohio, Ted Strickland, the Democratic opponent to the Republican senator Rob Portman in that state, said in a statement even as he lauded the underlying legal result. Republicans countered that even if the nominee, Judge Merrick B. Garland, had been on the court, he would probably have sided with the four more-liberal members and have handed organized labor a victory regardless. Most court experts say they believe the case would have gone against the unions on a 5-to-4 vote had Antonin Scalia lived. Democrats have court-related events planned both in and out of Washington on Wednesday. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, is to hold a news conference at the federal courthouse in Concord to urge Republicans to hold confirmation hearings and a vote on the nominee. Judge Garland is scheduled to meet on Capitol Hill with the Democratic senators Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York and Al Franken of Minnesota.
