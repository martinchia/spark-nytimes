Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These areÂ the places, faces and culinary selectionsÂ of 2016âs first proper bus tour. EVENT 19 Time: 12:40 p.m. Place: Manly, Iowa (population: 1,323) Site: Caseyâs General Store, a convenience-store chain and semi-pizzeria Mood: Crowded aisles, large beverages Food: taco pizza, meat galore, wedgie fries Drinks, in a well-stocked wine display: ringneck red, autumn hush, peach be with you Repeat customer: Mr. Cruz approached a woman who said she had seen him speak before. âYouâre a glutton for punishment,â he said. Service: Mr. Cruz, greeting workers behind the counter, offered to fetch some items. âAnyone need some gas? Gas? Powerball ticket? I recommend the Slushies, the Slushies are really good.â Highlight: It seems Mr. Cruz has been reading up. As he brushed past a New York Times reporter beside the register, he paused to comment on a detail in a post from Thursday night, when Mr. Cruz referred to the comedian Henny Youngman as âBenny.â âHenny? Benny? O.K.,â he said playfully. âYou know what? It was before my time.â The reporter confessed that the fact-check had required an Internet search. âYou had to look it up?â Mr. Cruz said with a grin.
