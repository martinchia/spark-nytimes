Republicans in New Hampshire are urging Fox News and party leaders to reconsider its plans to limit participation in presidential debates based on performance in polls.  The group of local lawmakers and activists argued in a letter to Roger Ailes, president of Fox News, and Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, that limiting the number of candidates who can participate in debates would supplant the role that early nominating states such as New Hampshire play in allowing voters to narrow the field. “Historically, it has been the responsibility of early primary and caucus states to closely examine and winnow the field of candidates, and it is not in the electorate’s interest to have TV debate criteria supplant this solemn duty,” they wrote. The letter comes as Iowa is fighting to retain the significance of its straw poll and other traditional early contest states are increasingly fearful of losing their status as springboards for those who eventually capture the nomination. Fox and CNN have said they would limit the number of candidates on the debate stage, basing the criteria on performance in national public polling. Lesser-known candidates like Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson have criticized this plan, and some political analysts have said that it will alter the way candidates campaign early on, as they focus on television exposure instead of retail politicking in hopes that they will get noticed. Bigger names, including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who is mulling a run, could also struggle to qualify to debate. The New Hampshire Republicans suggested that Fox consider dividing the debate into two panels and use a random drawing to determine who will participate in each. “The New Hampshire primary, as well as the contests in Iowa, South Carolina, and Nevada, exist to afford every candidate â regardless of money and polling â a level playing field and the opportunity to personally share their message and experience with as many voters as possible,” they wrote. Craig Benson and Stephen Merrill, former governors of New Hampshire, are among the more than 50 people who signed the letter. Fox is scheduled to broadcast the first debate on Aug. 6.
