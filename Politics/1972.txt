Is someone going to start listening to House Speaker Paul D. Ryan? Mr. Ryan, who insists he will not run for president even though a lot of Republicans seem to want him to, will give a speech on Wednesday, urging his party once again to focus on policy ideas, preferably those of House Republicans, in the race for the White House.  “Looking around at whatâs taking place in politics today, it is easy to get disheartened,” Mr. Ryan is expected to say, according to remarks prepared for a speech he is scheduled to deliver in his old digs in the hearing room of the Ways and Means Committee. âHow many of you find yourself just shaking your head at what you see from both sides?â âI have made it a mission of my speakership to raise our gaze and aim for a brighter horizon. Instead of talking about what politics is today, I want to talk about what politics can be. I want to talk about what our country can be.â Mr. Ryan has been persistently making the case that Republicans need a strong conservative slate of ideas to run a successful campaign this fall, a notion that the ascendancy of Donald J. Trump has so far appeared to contradict.  And what is Mr. Ryan not going to say?  âI intend to use my position as chairman of the Republican convention in Cleveland to thwart the will of tens of thousands of Republican voters by grabbing the nomination for myselfâ?  No, he won’t say that. But Republicans can keep asking.
