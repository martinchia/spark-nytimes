In 2008, when Hillary Rodham Clinton was waging a campaign for Democratic  “superdelegates” — party officials who could choose to back whichever candidate they wanted, regardless of whether that person had won their state — Bill Clinton worked the phones aggressively on her behalf.  He reached out to Deb Kozikowski, a superdelegate from Massachusetts wooed heavily by both the Clintons and the Obama campaign.  “Eight years ago, when she was running, her husband called me to ask me to support her, and when I asked him which state she would add to the 2000 map and his immediate response was ‘Arkansas,’ I laughed and said, ‘Do you want to try that again, because youâre not the one whoâs running?’ ” Ms. Kozikowski said. “And then he said, ‘Florida.’ If heâd said Florida first, that would have helped shift me away from Obama toward her. I never felt she wasnât qualified. I felt she wasnât in a position to win.”  This time, Ms. Kozikowski, who was contacted repeatedly over the last two years by the “super PAC” Ready for Hillary, sees a different type of Clinton campaign. So far, she said, the campaign seems to be resisting chasing states that are realistically out of reach but that appeal to the Clintons’ sense of history.  Some red-state Democrats are still hoping they can lure the Clintons to their states. Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, for example, said he had spoken on the phone with Mr. Clinton in recent weeks to ask him to speak at the West Virginia Democratic Partyâs Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in the fall. Mr. Clinton, he added, was one of the few national Democrats still widely popular in West Virginia.  Mrs. Clinton won the primary in that state in 2008 with a heavily lopsided victory. But the chances she could win it in a general election are quite slim.  For a year, Mrs. Clinton’s backers spoke often of a “new Clinton map,” one in which she would hold Mr. Obama’s 2012 re-election states but also be competitive in red states. Since the 2014 midterms and the Democrats’ losses — two Democrats with close ties to the Clintons, Senator Mark Pryor and the candidate for governor Mike Ross, both lost in Arkansas — few are openly musing about such a new map, which would require holding Mr. Obama’s coalition and appealing to working-class white voters.  In the 23 years since Mr. Clinton first  ran for president, Democrats in elected positions in Southern states have been largely eradicated. There are some states that Mr. Obama invested in during his 2008 election bid that could play a role in Mrs. Clinton’s map,  like Missouri. Other states with fast-emerging minority electorates that Democrats have been looking at for the last several years are Arizona and Georgia. For Mrs. Clinton’s team, the ability to stay on course and avoid being distracted by poll numbers that could make states that are out of reach seem friendly will be crucial. What’s more, in addition to Mrs. Clinton appearing to steer clear of her husband’s previously exhibited desire to placate allies, Democrats see the current electoral map as structurally much more problematic for Republicans.
