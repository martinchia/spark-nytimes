Jeb Bush introduced his campaignâs first television ad on Tuesday, casting himself as the candidate with the most extensive conservative rÃ©sumÃ© in a field of âD.C. politicians and self-promoters.â While the 33-second video includes many of the upbeat notes that might be expected of an early campaign ad â the candidate speaking inside a bustling place of business, leading a meeting, gabbing with workers in hats and hairnets â Mr. Bush wastes little time establishing a contrast to his competitors. The mention of âself-promoters,â in particular, seems an unsubtle jab at Donald J. Trump, whom Mr. Bush has increasingly targeted lately in response to Mr. Trumpâs broadsides. The former Florida governor has appeared particularly rankled by Mr. Trumpâs assessment of him as âlow energy.â Mr. Bush says in the ad: âIf you want more D.C. politicians or more self-promoters, you’ve got options. I’m offering something different: leadership, ideas and a proven conservative record.” He cites his efforts as governor to reduce taxes and spending and to create jobs. âAnybody can talk,â Mr. Bush continues. âI’ve delivered and I hope to earn your support.â The campaign said its initial ad buy of $500,000 would include broadcast television in Boston, Manchester, N.H., and on statewide cable in New Hampshire. It will run until Sept. 29, the campaign said, calling the ad âthe first step in a multiweek process where we will be expanding our advertising in New Hampshire and the other early states.â Here is the full text of the ad: âWe have an important choice to make about the direction of our country. If you want more D.C. politicians or more self-promoters, you’ve got options. I’m offering something different: leadership, ideas and a proven conservative record. As governor, I cut taxes, cut spending, balanced budgets and Florida led the nation in job creation. Anybody can talk. I’ve delivered and I hope to earn your support. I’m Jeb Bush and I approve this message.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
