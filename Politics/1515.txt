D.J. tWitch had his work cut out for him. Before Tuesday’s taping with Hillary Rodham Clinton, the executive producers of âThe Ellen DeGeneres Showâ said that the former first lady had never danced in her previous appearances with Ms. DeGeneres and that they didnât expect her to when she taped her latest sit-down. But during a commercial break, Ms. DeGeneresâs resident D.J. got Mrs. Clinton clapping her hands and swaying her hips to Ariana Grande. Pink and Amy Schumer joined Ms. DeGeneres and Mrs. Clinton onstage, and they all hugged and waved to a crowd of thousands overflowing around the Rockefeller Center ice skating rink, where Ms. DeGeneres is filming her show this week. The celebrity spectacle had tourists and fans screaming (mostly for Ms. DeGeneres), but despite the Midtown Manhattan setting, it provided a cozy and safe atmosphere for Mrs. Clinton, who has been dogged by stories about her private email use at the State Department. Last season, âEllenâ had 3.4 million viewers daily, 73 percent of whom were women, according to Nielsen, making Ms. DeGeneresâs support potentially more influential than any political endorsement. Ms. DeGeneres told Mrs. Clinton that she thought the email controversy was overblown and that women are held to a different standard than men. âYou are the smartest and most qualified person for the job,â the comedian said, after professing that she is not political. âIf I want to hire a plumber, I want someone who has snaked a drain before.â The interview, which will be broadcast on Thursday afternoon, came after Mrs. Clinton, in an interview with ABC News, apologized for using a private server for her State Department email, a sentiment she echoed on “Ellen,” telling the host: “I made a mistake. I am sorry for all the confusion that has ensued. I take responsibility.” But on âEllenâ it was mostly fun. Ms. DeGeneres mentioned Mrs. Clintonâs TV preferences, as revealed in the private emails the State Department has released, and asked her if she watches ABCâs soapy political drama âScandal.â Mrs. Clinton said she TiVos the show while on the road, adding, âI especially liked the story about the first lady running for Senate.â Asked what she would prefer her granddaughter, Charlotte, call her when she starts talking, Mrs. Clinton said casually, âIâm fine with Grandma, Iâm fine with Madame President, you know, whatever.â Ms. DeGeneres brought a surprise guest out after a commercial break â a 5-year-old named Macy with an encyclopedic knowledge of presidential history. Macy quizzed Mrs. Clinton on whether she ate Tabasco on everything (âI eat a lot of Tabasco and other hot sauce,â she replied) and if it was true that former President Bill Clinton was allergic to the White House Christmas tree. (He was. The Clintons used an artificial tree.) Mrs. Clinton mostly avoided politics, but she had some curt advice for one potential opponent. When asked what she thought of Kanye Westâs potential run in 2020, Mrs. Clinton said, âI would only ask him, if Iâm running for re-election, to wait.â By AMY CHOZICK Mrs. Clinton taped an episode of âThe Ellen DeGeneres Showâ in hopes of reaching female voters who do not consume traditional news media.
