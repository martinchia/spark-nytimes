Hillary Clinton's remarks in Ames, Iowa, on Tuesday recalled language she used in 2008. I wish that we could elect a Democratic president who could wave a magic wand and say, âWe shall do this, and we shall do that.â That ainât the real world we’re living in!â As the polls tighten in Hillary Clintonâs primary fight against Senator Bernie Sanders, her language is starting to carry echoes from a similar point in 2008, when Senator Barack Obama started surging. In Ames, Iowa, on Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton delivered a thinly veiled jab at Mr. Sanders, suggesting he was making big promises that the realities of divided government would make impossible to deliver on. âI wish that we could elect a Democratic president who could wave a magic wand and say, âWe shall do this, and we shall do that.â That ainât the real world we’re living in!â It was not the first appearance of the magic wand in Mrs. Clintonâs campaign-trail speech. In February 2008, she used it to  to argue that Mr. Obamaâs call for unity showed he was naive about the ways of Washington: âThe skies will open, the light will come down, celestial choirs will be singing and everyone will know we should do the right thing and the world will be perfect,â she said archly in Providence, R.I. âMaybe Iâve just lived a little long, but I have no illusions about how hard this is going to be. You are not going to wave a magic wand and have the special interests disappear!â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
