MANCHESTER, N.H. — Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont canceled an event he had scheduled Wednesday before a televised town-hall-style event later at night. After traveling to his home in Burlington, Vt., on Tuesday night from New Hampshire, Mr. Sanders remained there Wednesday morning and cleared most of his schedule. The senator planned to return to New Hampshire later Wednesday for the 9 p.m. event in Derry, which Hillary Clinton also is attending and will be broadcast on CNN.  Campaign aides said the scheduling changes were aimed at giving Mr. Sanders more time to prepare for the event. (The candidates also have a formal debate in New Hampshire on Thursday night, on MSNBC.) “We wanted to give him more time to prepare for the town hall tonight,” said Karthik Ganapathy, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders. Mr. Sanders did start his day early, appearing on three morning programs from 7 a.m. to 8:15 a.m. The event he canceled was   a rally at the Rochester Opera House. He had also canceled a 5 p.m. press conference on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade policy he opposes, but then later restored it. When asked whether Mr. Sanders also needed to get more rest because of the long night after the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Ganapathy said the decision was only about giving the senator more time to prepare for the town hall.
