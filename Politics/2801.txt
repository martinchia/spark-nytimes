Senate Republicans must feel mildly giddy that they may have an actual bill to pass on the Senate floor, where activities have been a tad limited as of late. But a measure to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration and keep airports running and planes in the air may get gummed up by unrelated tax provisions. Democrats say some tax breaks to support investments in geothermal, small wind power and other renewable energy forces were last year inadvertently left out of a tax package that extended credits for wind and solar power. They are seeking to use the F.A.A. bill â one the Senate has to pass â as a vehicle to close the loop on those tax provisions.  “No one intended to leave them out,â Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, a Democrat, said on Tuesday. âWeâre working to get those in now.â However, scores of conservative groups oppose the move, and this week they sent a letter to Senator Orrin G. Hatch, a Utah Republican and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, urging him to reject the move. The F.A.A. bill needs to be approved over the next few weeks before the Senate moves on to the annual spending bills. Unlike the House bill, it does not seek to privatize the nationâs air traffic control system. Democrats also want more security provisions in light of the terrorist attacks in Brussels last month; Republicans are not expected to reject those efforts.
