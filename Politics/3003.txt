Donald J. Trump appears to be ready to let bygones be bygones — with Roger Ailes. Mr. Trump said on Monday that Mr. Ailes, the chairman and chief executive of Fox News, called him and assured him that the network would treat him fairly.  Roger Ailes just called. He is a great guy & assures me that âTrumpâ will be treated fairly on @FoxNews. His word is always good! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 10, 2015  Mr. Trump was angered on Thursday when Megyn Kelly, the moderator of the Republican presidential debate, questioned him about derogatory comments he has made about women. He shunned the network over the weekend, doing interviews instead with its rivals.  For Mr. Ailes, making peace with Mr. Trump could be more about profits than political correctness. The debate Thursday drew more than 20 million viewers, in part thanks to Mr. Trump’s showmanship. The detente appears to have already taken effect. In an emailed statement on Monday evening, Mr Ailes said that in his conversation with Mr. Trump he had “again expressed my confidence in Megyn Kelly,” telling Mr. Trump that “I support her 100 percent.”
He added: “I assured him that we will continue to cover this campaign with fairness and balance. We had a blunt but cordial conversation and the air has been cleared.â Mr. Trump has not yet made amends with Ms. Kelly, after he directed sharp criticism at her in the days after the debate.  Many women have also not forgiven him for the remark he made suggesting that Ms. Kelly had “blood coming out of her wherever” during the debate. Angered by what they considered another example of his sexism, they have taken to Twitter tell him details of their menstrual cycles.
