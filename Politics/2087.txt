MONTGOMERY, Ala. â Sixty years after Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white man, Hillary Clinton arrives here to commemorate the bus boycott that began in this Deep South city on Dec. 1, 1955. On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton will deliver a keynote address at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. organized the Montgomery bus boycott in the basement six decades earlier. The speech, part of a two-day event put on by the National Bar Association, the country’s largest professional organization of African-American lawyers and judges, will focus on the role lawyers played in the Montgomery bus boycott and the civil rights movement. Mrs. Clinton will join a lineup of prominent black activists and lawyers, including Benjamin L. Crump, the president of the National Bar Association who represented the families of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown; Representative Terri A. Sewell of Alabama; and the Rev. Bernice King, daughter of Dr. King.  The event is not organized by Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, and the association is one of a handful of outside organizations she has agreed to address since she declared her candidacy in April, emphasizing the importance of the group and the setting.  Mrs. Clinton has prioritized issues of race and civil rights in her campaign. Her first major policy speech called for an overhaul of the criminal justice system as she listed the names of young black men who had been killed by white police officers. She has also met with the mothers of African-American teenagers who died in gun violence as well as with members of the Black Lives Matter movement. The National Bar Association event will conclude with attendees traveling to Selma to walk across the Edmund Pettus Bridge and an unveiling of a new historical marker at the site in Montgomery where Ms. Parks was arrested.
