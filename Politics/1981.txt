Less than two months ago, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said that deciding between Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas amounted to selecting whether to be âshot or poisoned.” He has made his choice. Mr. Graham, who recently joked about murdering Mr. Cruz on the Senate floor, plans to attend a fund-raiser on Monday in Washington as a special guest of the Cruz campaign. The event, tied to a gathering of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, known as Aipac, is held âto honor and support a great friend of Israel and the Jewish people, and the next president of the United States, Ted Cruz,â according to an invitation. In a statement, Mr. Graham called his colleague âthe best alternative to Donald Trump.â In recent weeks, Mr. Graham, who supported Jeb Bush for president, has signaled an openness to Mr. Cruzâs campaign, if a bit grudgingly. In an interview with NBCâs âMeet the Pressâ earlier this month, he summed up the dim view many establishment Republicans have of their remaining options. âSome hope with Ted,â he said, âno hope with Donald.â Mr. Graham said in an interview Thursday that though he planned to raise money on behalf of Mr. Cruz, he likes John Kasich. âBut he doesnât have the path that Ted does in terms of stopping Trump, which is the most important thing,â he said, referring to Mr. Kasich. Mr. Graham conceded that he has been strikingly critical of Mr. Cruz but that his desire to halt Mr. Trumpâs momentum took precedent. âHaving said that, it pales in comparison with my differences with Trump,â Mr. Graham said. âI think Ted Cruz is a reliable Republican, strong on Israel, will repeal and replace Obamacare, will be good on the Supreme Court. So we have many things in common, but we also have many differences.â
