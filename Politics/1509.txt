DES MOINES â Just eight months ago, President Obama was proposing to effectively end the popular college savings accounts known as 529s. On Monday, with Mr. Obama next to him, Education Secretary Arne Duncan embraced them and even seemed to suggest they should be expanded. At a town hall-style meeting at North High School here, the president was asked about the accounts, which many parents use to save for their children’s college tuition. Mr. Obama made no mention of his budget plan that he abandoned just a week after making it in January. Instead, he passed the question to Mr. Duncan. “My wife and I are putting money actively into 529s and trying to save, and getting the federal government to support that more, or encourage that, would be fantastic,” Mr. Duncan said. “And again this is something we have to work with the Congress to do the right thing.”  For parents trying to save for college, he added, “we need to incentivize that and reward that.” Republicans quickly pointed out the contrast to the scrapped budget plan.  âSecretary Duncan is right â we need to encourage hard-working families saving for college, and thatâs why Republicans led the House in a bipartisan effort to expand 529 plans in February,” said Cory Fritz, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio. “Perhaps now the White House will finally admit taxing middle-class savings is bad policy, and endorse our House-passed bill to expand these important programs.â  The White House initially packaged its proposed change to 529s with a new tax credit that it said would benefit more families at lower income levels, arguing that 529s were more helpful to those with higher incomes. But the backlash from parents and lawmakers from both parties forced a quick retreat.
