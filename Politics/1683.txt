Senator Bernie Sanders has made significant inroads into Hillary Clinton’s national lead with likely Democratic voters, according to a poll released Thursday that showed him riding a surge of momentum after his landslide victory in New Hampshire last week. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey found that 53 percent of Democrats polled support Mrs. Clinton, while 42 percent support Mr. Sanders. While the 11 percentage point gap remains substantial, a month ago Mrs. Clinton was leading by 25 points. Mrs. Clinton continues to be popular among older voters and minorities. Mr. Sanders holds strong leads with white men and voters under 50. The results signal a tight race as Democrats face nominating contests in Nevada and South Carolina. Mrs. Clinton holds a wideÂ lead in most polls in South Carolina, where the Democratic primary is Feb. 27, but the caucuses in Nevada on Saturday are expected to be close. Voters remain concerned about Mrs. Clinton’s speaking fees from Wall Street banks, and they show trepidation about Mr. Sanders’s lack of foreign policy experience, according to the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Both candidates were widely viewed as being progressive — a point of contention between them. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.
