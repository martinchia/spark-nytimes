Hillary Rodham Clinton has picked up a string of early support from labor unions in recent weeks and on Thursday took her pro-union message to Gov. Scott Walker’s backyard. At a rally in Milwaukee, Mrs. Clinton riled up the crowd, asking “What happens when you are a proud union member and you have a governor that wants to drive you out?” Mr. Walker, a Republican presidential candidate, earned his party’s attention for taking on the labor unions in Wisconsin, a battle that catapulted him to the national spotlight. Mrs. Clinton said Mr. Walker “gets his marching orders from the Koch Brothers and just goes down the list.” A large portion of Mrs. Clinton’s event, a grassroots organizing rally for women, was dedicated to criticizing Mr. Walker who, she said, “made it his personal mission to roll back women’s health and rights.”  Mrs. Clinton’s aides have said her best chance to break through the noise over her use of a private email server while Secretary of Stat is to directly contrast herself to the Republicans, something she planned to do in starker terms post-Labor Day. Mr. Walker responded to Mrs. Clinton in a Tweet: “While you pander to union bosses,” he wrote, “I give workers freedom to choose if they want to be in a union or not.”
