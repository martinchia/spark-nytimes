Donald J. Trump, who has admitted in the past to sometimes employing a pseudonym in which he pretended to be a spokesman for himself, insisted in an interview with NBC’s “Today” show on Friday that an audiotape from 1991 featuring a man claiming to be Mr. Trump’s spokesman was not him.  The audio of the interview with a People magazine reporter, obtained by The Washington Post, sounded similar to Mr. Trump’s cadences. At one point, the speaker â who was discussing Mr. Trump’s divorce from his first wife, Ivana, in detail â used the first person when answering a question that was about the developer.  When pressed about it by Savannah Guthrie on “Today” whether it was him, Mr. Trump said: “I don’t think it, I don’t know anything about it. You’re telling me about it for the first time and it doesn’t sound like my voice at all. I have many, many people that are trying to imitate my voice and you can imagine that, and this sounds like one of these scams, one of the many scams. Doesn’t sound like me.”  Mr. Trump insisted again: “It was not me on the phone. And when was this, 25 years ago?”  Ms. Guthrie said it was that long ago, and Mr. Trump said: “Wow, you mean you’re going so low as to talk about something that took place 25 years ago about whether or not I made a phone call. I guess you’re saying under a presumed name.”   “The answer is no,” he said, “and let’s get onto more current subjects, I mean, I know it’s wonderful for your listeners but I think we have more important things to discuss.”  Mr. Trump has acknowledged in the past calling reporters under the name John Barron, a practice he described at the time as a joke gone awry.
