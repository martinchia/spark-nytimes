Good Monday morning from Washington, where Congress is on recess, President Obama is on vacation, and the debate’s hurly-burly is done, the battle lost and won. Among those claiming victory is Donald J. Trump, whose subsequent online confrontation with the Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly was widely seen as sexist, and has prompted hand-wringing among the other candidates about what should be done with him. Not only is Mr. Trump not going away, but he also is ensuring that another week on the campaign trail will begin with questions that the rest of the Republican candidates are growing sick of. They begin with: “Donald Trump said …” In an attempt to shift attention away from his inflammatory comments about Ms. Kelly, Mr. Trump used his appearances on the Sunday morning TV news programs to attack Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, and Carly Fiorina, two of his rivals. (In typical Trump style, he went on the attack against Mr. Bush and Ms. Fiorina because, of the Republican presidential hopefuls, they had been among the most critical of his comments about Ms. Kelly.) Appearing on ABC’s “This Week,” he targeted Ms. Fiorina for her rocky tenure as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and mocked her for her 10-percentage-point loss in a California Senate race in 2010. And in nearly every program he called into, he hammered Mr. Bush for saying last week that he was “not sure we need half a billion dollars for women’s health issues.” (Mr. Trump, by contrast, vowed on CBS’s “Face the Nation” that he “will be phenomenal to the women.”) It is not difficult to imagine what Ms. Fiorina and Mr. Bush will be asked as they take to the road this week. And therein lies the dilemma: If candidates denounce Mr. Trump’s provocations, they ensure that he will attack them, which then forces them to respond to Mr. Trump. And on it goes. â Jonathan Martin Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. Though Mr. Obama is in Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts with his family, his hard push to secure support for the Iran nuclear deal is sure to continue this week from afar, especially in the face of Senator Chuck Schumer‘s statements that he would not support it. Hillary Rodham Clinton will be in New Hampshire on Monday, where she is expected to announce a 10-year, $350 billion plan to make tuition at public four-year universities debt-free, a less expensive plan than the more ambitious, $500 billion tuition-free plan put forth by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. And though the Iowa Straw Poll was terminated this year out of a lack of interest from the candidates, most of them will participate in The Des Moines Register Soapbox, which starts on Thursday and runs through Aug. 22 at the 2015 Iowa State Fair. Each candidate will speak for about 20 minutes to people who have paid the fair’s admission fee, so the crowds are sure to be more split than the usual rallies filled with supporters. Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton are not participating. Summer in Iowa or New Hampshire can feel crowded for political candidates, especially in an election season with over 20 candidates from both parties. So Senator Ted Cruz of Texas headed south for a weeklong, seven-state bus tour of the southeast, with over 20 events featuring plenty of southern flavor: barbecue, cowboy boots, biscuits and sweet tea. He hit the open road on Friday, immediately after the debate, holding his kickoff event in South Carolina. On Monday, he heads to Tennessee, beginning with a âBiscuits and Gravy Breakfastâ in Chattanooga and ending with a speech at a local countyâs Reagan Day dinner. The pivot south represents for Mr. Cruz a look beyond the early primary states to those that will be a part of the âS.E.C. primaryâ on March 1 (so nicknamed because the states are part of the N.C.A.A.âs Southeastern Conference). While the early nominating states will set the momentum for the season, the primaries on March 1 will be the country’s first chance to see who will be in a point of strength, or desperation, in their delegate counts. â Nick Corasaniti Mr. Sanders and Howard Dean, a doctor and former governor who ran for the Democratic nomination in 2004, are both Democrats from Vermont who caught a populist wave during their runs, but there are striking differences between the two â in their campaign appeals, ideologies and skills as candidates â which may go far in determining whether Mr. Sanders follows Mr. Deanâs trajectory in 2004: a once-hot comet who quickly burns out after Iowa. Mr. Trump has declined to rule out seeking the nomination as an independent if he fails to get the Republican nomination. But his flirtation with running as a third-party candidate is not new. In an example of how candidates are using social media to reach out to potential voters, Mrs. Clinton, who is trying to connect with voters on a more personal level, has a Pinterest page, and is posting items on “major turning points, big events, and favorite memories,” including her wedding day and the birth of her daughter, Chelsea. The 2016 election has had only one set of debates and no votes have been cast, but CNN has collected 13 of what it calls “jaw-dropping” moments so far. And not all of them are about Mr. Trump. And Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon whose closing statements in the Republican debate on Thursday â “I’m the only one to separate Siamese twins” â won him some praise, visited a church in Iowa on Sunday, offering “a more personal glimpse” of his candidacy, The Des Moines Register writes, including details about his marriage and about growing up in poverty in Detroit. Mr. Bush‘s work with the Bloomberg Family Foundation â where he served as a director â is being scrutinized because of the charity’s support of Planned Parenthood, Politico reports. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was stretching the truth when he asserted in Thursday’s debate that the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law had destroyed 40 percent of the nation’s small and midsize community banks, The Washington Post reports. Even during big speeches, the Senate is often a nearly empty chamber as senators make their case to the C-Span cameras and scattered tourists instead of directly to one another. But Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, said he believed the coming debate on the Iran nuclear agreement deserved better. Mr. McConnell said last week that he intended to ask all senators to be at their desks and attentive while others lay out their views on the agreement, which will be the first item of business when the Senate returns on Sept. 8. A full Senate would emphasize the extraordinary importance, Mr. McConnell said, of a measure that deserves the Senateâs respect. “Each senator will get an opportunity to speak and actually be listened to by other senators,” Mr. McConnell said on Thursday, implicitly acknowledging how unusual that was. Allowing each senator a chance to speak traditionally occurs only on the most momentous bills, such as war authorizations. Whether busy senators will comply with Mr. McConnell’s request, however, remains to be seen. â Carl Hulse Like the Politics Newsletter? Get it delivered to your inbox.
