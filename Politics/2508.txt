Hillary Rodham Clinton pledged on Monday to take extra steps to end sexual assaults on college campuses, saying during a trip to Iowa that she would try to âensure a fair processâ in such cases and increase support for victims. Mrs. Clinton made the remarks about âconfronting the epidemic of sexual assault on college campusesâ during an appearance at a âWomen for Hillaryâ organizing meeting at the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls. The event took place as her campaign is looking to shore up support among women, who make up one of her core groups of support, and with whom her numbers have been slipping in recent national polls. During her address, Mrs. Clinton said, âI saw heads nod when I said one in five women report they were sexually assaulted during college.” âJust look around you,” she said. “If we were to have one out of every five women stand up, that would be a pretty big crowd. Think of the impact on their lives. Theyâre trying to manage the emotional, physical, sometimes the educational, financial fallout — they miss classes, some drop out, some never finish their education.â The issue is âfinally gaining the attention it deserves,â Mrs. Clinton said, noting that President Obama has focused on the problem. âBut it is not enough to condemn campus sexual assault. We need to end campus sexual assault.â She said that some campuses don’t offer support services like âcounseling and health care, so a lot of young women are truly lost and left out.â And some campuses have a âmaze of bureaucracyâ that makes it harder for victims to work through the aftermath of an attack, she said. âIâll fight to make sure that every campus offers every survivor the support she needs, and weâll make sure that these services are comprehensive, confidential and coordinated,â Mrs. Clinton said. âWe need to ensure a fair process for all involved, whether itâs in campus disciplinary proceedings or a criminal justice system,â she said. âRape is a crime wherever it happens, and schools have an obligation — I think itâs both a legal obligation and a moral obligation — to protect every studentâs right to get an education free from discrimination, free from fear, particularly as to oneâs safety.â  Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
