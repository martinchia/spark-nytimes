Good Monday morning from Washington, where this week Congress is in recess, Jeb Bush makes a big trip to South Carolina, and another Republican contender is set to join the fold. But just because the Supreme Court ruled in two big cases last week doesn’t mean its work is done. The nation is still catching its breath from last week’s rulings in favor of same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act, but the Supreme Court has three important decisions to go before it closes its term on Monday. The court on Monday will decide cases on congressional redistricting, lethal injection and power plant emissions, each with significant political, criminal justice and environmental ramifications. The power plant case is a challenge by industry and some states to new Obama administration limits on emissions that opponents say were instituted without adequately weighing the costs. In the lethal injection case, inmates in Oklahoma argue that the drugs used can cause severe pain during the execution and therefore violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. And the redistricting case could have major implications for the future makeup of Congress. In a case out of Arizona, Republican members of the Legislature argue that an independent redistricting commission approved by voters stripped them of their constitutional power to draw congressional district lines. About a dozen states have created such independent ways to define districts, hoping to reduce the gerrymandering that is considered a major contributor to congressional polarization. But when the case was argued in March, justices seemed skeptical that a commission could replace lawmakers when the Constitution states that the legislatures are responsible for determining “the times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives.” Carl Hulse Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. Tuesday was once considered the absolute deadline for a nuclear deal with Iran, but both sides agree that more time is needed. Still, how the talks proceed this week will determine whether Secretary of State John Kerry can make a convincing argument to skeptics in Congress that he has negotiated a workable deal to cripple Iranâs nuclear capability. And with the Supreme Court’s term ending and with Congress on break, there is little news to compete with the campaign trail. Among Republicans this week, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky will hold several events in Nevada on Monday and will be in Colorado on Tuesday before heading to Iowa, where he’ll have some company, for the buildup to July 4. Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, will hold several events in Iowa as well and will formally open his campaign headquarters there on Tuesday. Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana will be in the state, attending three town-hall-style events sponsored by a “super PAC” supporting him; and Martin O’Malley, a Democrat and former Maryland governor, will also hold events there. As for the rest of the Democrats, Hillary Rodham Clinton will have events and fund-raisers in New York City, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will hold a large rally in Madison, Wis., on Tuesday. Then he’ll head to Iowa. When Mr. Bush returns to South Carolina on Monday for a trip that was postponed after the mass shooting at a black church in Charleston, he will meet with pastors there, his aides say, to listen and learn from what he hears. Mr. Bush is the only candidate from a broad Republican field who has made such an overture in the wake of the shootings, in which a white gunman killed nine African-Americans during a Bible study. The political discourse so far has focused on gun control and on whether the era has passed for waving the Confederate battle flag over state capitols. But Mr. Bush is distancing himself from his fellow Republicans with the Charleston trip, an effort that highlights that he is not the favorite of the partyâs base, but is also showing that he is mindful of the primaryâs impact on the eventual nomineeâs ability to compete in a general election. — Maggie Haberman The Supreme Court’s ruling on same-sex marriage dominated the morning news shows on Sunday, as several Republican candidates illustrated the split in the party over how to respond. Also on Sunday, Mr. Sanders defended his record on gun control after Mr. O’Malley criticized him over his votes against background checks and in support of legal protection for gun manufacturers in lawsuits. The fast-moving outcry against the Confederate flag grew through churches, social media and the relatives of the nine people who were killed in Charleston, with the campaign converting or taming opponents. When Mr. Bush and Mrs. Clinton announced their presidential candidacies this year, they released gauzy videos showing voters who either agreed with their policy platforms, or whose lives had been affected by them. But the initial 2016 campaign video unveiled on Sunday by Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey focuses on one life: his own. In a two-minute video released by his aides before his official campaign kickoff on Tuesday, Mr. Christie talks about why he is the âbluntâ figure who has been criticized for telling off teachers at town-hall-style meetings. âI get accused a lot of times of being too blunt and too direct and saying whatâs on my mind just a little too loudly,â Mr. Christie says in the video, which finds him addressing the audience in one of his favored town-hall-style meetings. âI have an Irish father, and I had a Sicilian mother,â he says, offering an explanation. His mother, he says, âset the toneâ at home. The video, titled âTelling It Like It Is,â which is expected to be Mr. Christieâs slogan, affirms a basic fact about his candidacy: It will be built first and foremost on selling his personal style. There is no mention in the video of policy; Mr. Christie is at odds with some of the most conservative voters over an array of positions. There is also no mention of his time as governor of New Jersey, which has experienced a record number of credit downgrades under Mr. Christieâs tenure, and has lingering pension problems. Instead, Mr. Christie uses the video to talk about how his interactions with his mother made him who he is, and that a pivotal moment with her as she lay dying âaffirmed for me forever that Iâm going to be this way.â — Maggie Haberman Mr. Bush often used his family connections to promote business deals, exposing himself to reputational risk in the process, The Washington Post reports. Last week, Politico writes, could have been the worst of President Obama‘s tenure, with his trade bill in doubt and his signature health law and same-sex marriage on the line before the Supreme Court. Instead, the week ended as one of his best, and his “presidency is reborn” with many of his supporters saying “they finally saw the man who inspired them in â08.” Politico also reported on Sunday that Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, would enter the race on July 21. Mr. Jindalâs appearances in Iowa this week coincide, The Des Moines Register reports, with a $500,000 ad buy in the state. The spot will repeat themes from his presidential announcement last week that he is “tired of hyphenated Americans,” and that immigrants to the United States should adopt “our values.” Like the Politics Newsletter?
