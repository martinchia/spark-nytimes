MANCHESTER, N.H. â Jeb Bush … party animal? That was a question posed to Mr. Bush at a âLife of the Partyâ young professionals event here on Wednesday afternoon: If he was throwing a party at the White House, what would the shindig entail?  His answer was not entirely surprising. âI wouldnât invite Donald Trump,â he said to laughter. Mr. Bush explained that the hypothetical question reminded him of a real-life experience when he was the governor of Florida, and one of his department secretaries had everyone take the Myers-Briggs personality test. They broke the group into extroverts and introverts, and yes, Mr. Bush was one of a handful or introverts, and asked them to plan a party.   The introverts, Mr. Bush said, âquickly decided that we were all going to read a book that week and then we would have an interesting dinner conversation that would be over early, about the book that we read.â He continued: âAnd the extroverts didnât plan their party. They started partying. They literally got a congo-line together, and they came into our room to mock us.â Asked who he would invite if he could choose two historical figures and one celebrity, Mr. Bush opted for Winston Churchill and Neil Armstrong. âWinston Churchill is probably the guy that I most admire just because of the range of his experience and knowledge, and his life experience,â Mr. Bush said. He even suggested giving Mr. Churchill âa brandy and a cigar,â before again turning practical. âIt would have to be outdoors, probably, if that was the case, but that would be well worth it,â he said. Recalling an argument heâd had with the actor Matt Damon over school choice, which he said felt âsuperficial,â Mr. Bush said he probably wouldnât bother to invite a celebrity.  The questioning, however, took a poignant turn, when Mr. Bush was asked what he read. âIâm reading the biography of my dad — surprise, surprise there,â he said, referring to Jon Meachamâs new book on the first President Bush, “Destiny and Power.” He said he had been surprised to learn that his father, who kept a diary, âhad doubts about himself, doubts about where he was in life.â âI mean, I always saw him totally in charge, I idolized the guy, so it was an interesting insight that he was a human being, you know, upset when he lost and happy when he won,â he said. âIt was kind of strange, but when youâre a son of someone, you donât get those kind of insights.â At another point, when a questioner said he hoped to turn away from policy and return to the personal, Mr. Bush cracked, âJust donât go boxers or briefs on me.â So that answer, alas, remains a mystery.
