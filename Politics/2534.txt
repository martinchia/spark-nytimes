Hillary Rodham Clinton will make the first stop of her presidential campaign in Virginia on Friday to headline the local Democratic Partyâs Jefferson Jackson dinner. Her remarks will come against the backdrop of major Supreme Court decisions. She celebrated on Thursday the courtâs ruling to affirm a key part of President Obamaâs Affordable Care Act, writing on Twitter: âYes! SCOTUS affirms what we know is true in our hearts and under the law: Health insurance should be affordable & available to all.â And she has implored the justices to rule that states cannot ban same-sex marriage.  Mrs. Clinton will likely address both cases in the Virginia address, but the state, with its large black population, will also present her the opportunity to continue her remarks on race and what she calls âcommon sense gun controlâ in the aftermath of the attack at a black church in Charleston, S.C. Virginia represents a trend indicator of sorts in the 2016 race. For the Clinton campaign, the goal will be to appeal to a broad cross-section of black and white voters.  Senator Barack Obama won the state in 2008, the first time a Democratic presidential nominee captured Virginia since President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. President Obama also defeated Mitt Romney in Virginia in 2012. Mrs. Clinton has deep ties to Virginia. A longtime ally and fund-raiser for Bill and Hillary Clinton, Terry McAuliffe, was elected governor in 2013.  Mr. McAuliffe’s campaign manager in that close election, Robby Mook, now runs Mrs. Clintonâs campaign and is introducing a similar data-driven grass-roots strategy. He brought with him an army of young operatives (the so-called Mook Mafia), many of whom helped Mr. McAuliffe defeat his conservative Republican opponent, Ken Cuccinelli.
