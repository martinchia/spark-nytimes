Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard professor, ended his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, despite being able to raise $1 million before Labor Day. Lawrence Lessig, the Harvard professor who began a late campaign for president, announced that he was ending his bid for the Democratic nomination, citing his exclusion from the debate stage.  “No doubt a better candidate could have gone further, though I doubt anyone could have worked harder, but regardless, I must today end my campaign for the Democratic nomination and turn to the question of how to best to continue to press for this reform now,” Mr. Lessig said in a video posted to his YouTube page. He entered the race in September, much later than other candidates, on a mission to change the country’s campaign finance system.  Mr. Lessig wasn’t included in the first Democratic debate, and he acknowledged in the beginning of the video that “unless we can time travel,” he wouldn’t qualify for the next stage, either. “From the start it was clear that getting into the Democratic debates was the essential step in this campaign,” Mr. Lessig said in the video. “I may be known in tiny corners of the tubes of the Internets, but I am not well-known to the American public generally.” Last month, he said in an interview that if he didn’t make it into either of the first two debates, he would most likely end his campaign.  Despite being able to raise over $1 million before Labor Day, and spending nearly half of it, Mr. Lessig had been struggling to get noticed anywhere on the campaign trail â he wasn’t offered an invitation to speak at annual Jefferson-Jackson Dinner in Iowa last month, either.
