Representative Donna Edwards on Tuesday announced that she would enter the race to replace Senator Barbara A. Mikulski of Maryland, setting up what is likely to be a competitive Democratic primary. Ms. Edwards, who has served in Congress since 2008, announced her intention to run just under a week after Representative Chris Van Hollen said he would pursue the seat of Ms. Mikulski, who is retiring in 2017. She could pose a  formidable challenge to Mr. Van Hollen, the ranking member of the House Budget Committee, who has received the support of Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate. In a video sent to her supporters, Ms. Edwards highlighted her humble political roots as a single mother who fought developers encroaching on her neighborhood. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a liberal advocacy organization, threw its support behind Ms. Edwards immediately after her announcement. Stephanie Taylor, a founder of the group, offered a strong endorsement and pointed to Ms. Edwards’s background as a community activist. âDonna Edwards has proven time and again that she’s a bold progressive,â she said in a statement. âSheâs not just a progressive ally â sheâs one of us.â
