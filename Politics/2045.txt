Good Wednesday morning from Washington, where Republicans are declaring a legislative victory even while in recess, candidates are sending urgent appeals for money, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is officially running. But it’s another release of Hillary Rodham Clinton emails from her time at the State Department that is driving the bus. The latest round of Mrs. Clinton’s emails from her tenure as secretary of state show further correspondence with her friend and longtime adviser Sidney Blumenthal and contain several items that were later changed to classified. Upon initial review, the messages contain no incriminating evidence that her opponents could use as large-scale attacks, but there will almost certainly be renewed focus on her reliance on Mr. Blumenthal, whom her aides expressed concern about in one email as having “outed himself ” for engaging with the State Department. There are also plenty of smaller bits of interest that offer insight and for which she could face some criticism. The emails show she expressed frustration at learning through news reports about some goings-on in the Obama administration. She needed advice from a longtime aide about how to use a fax machine, which will almost certainly be recycled by critics who seek to make her look out of touch. And she questioned whether she would be compared with Henry A. Kissinger, who had daily meetings with President Richard M. Nixon as his secretary of state, unlike her weekly meetings with President Obama. In September 2009, her former pollster Mark Penn, who came under fire during and over her failed 2008 presidential campaign, emailed her to criticize Mr. Obama’s “lack of clear Afghanistan policy” and to offer feedback on a speech. Mrs. Clinton forwarded the email to her aides, saying that the speech advice was probably right, but that they should “overlook the source.” She also traded emails with two Obama administration officials on the private email address, though White House aides have insisted they didnât know she had been using a private email server for State Department business. There is nothing in the exchanges so far to indicate they did. Maggie Haberman Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. Mr. Obama will hold a news conference in the morning to speak about Cuba, where he is expected to announce the mutual reopening of embassies. As July 4 approaches, Mr. Christie will spend his first full day as an official candidate in New Hampshire, while much of the rest of the field is in Iowa, emphasizing meet-and-greets and the town-hall-style events Mr. Christie is known for. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky: Several meet-and-greets. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas: Multiple town-hall-style meetings. Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana: Town halls. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina: Town halls and a meet-and-greet. Conservatives declared victory on Tuesday after preventing the charter of the Export-Import Bank from being renewed before a June 30 deadline. But it was a peculiar sort of Washington win. None of the bank’s 420 employees were expected to be furloughed for now. The reason? It needs to keep track of the $112 billion in outstanding loans and guarantees intended to lift exports. What it won’t be doing is accepting loan applications or moving ahead on any of those that had not been approved before the deadline. Backers of the bank expect to win the charter’s renewal in the fall. Still, those who portrayed the bank as a case study in “crony capitalism” can savor success â however short-lived â because they successfully blocked an extension of the charter for the first time in 80 years. Federal agencies are hard to shut down, and they often narrowly escape such brinkmanship. Aware of the coming push for renewal, conservatives called on the bank to begin liquidating its assets and for Republican leaders to do what they can to preserve the win. — Carl Hulse Though Mr. Christie’s campaign announcement, seemingly timed with campaign finance filing laws in mind, took place in New Jersey, falling poll numbers and lingering resentments there might make it a tough state to win in the Republican primary. If he does win the party nomination, here is how his path to victory might look and where he stands on several important issues. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has added to an already significant ad buy in the four early voting states, putting the total airtime he has reserved so far in the contests at more than $7 million. And Jeb Bushâs time away from public life has been good for him, at least financially, as he and his wife, Columba, reported adjusted gross income of $7.3 million on his 2013 tax return, the last of 33 years of returns he released on Tuesday. The digital desperation was palpable “Huge opportunity.” “We are so close.” “Time is almost up.” “Distraught.” “Most important deadline yet.” And, of course, the ever-persuasive appeal from Barack Obama himself: “I need you, (your name here).” These email pleas for small dollars were sent on Monday and Tuesday and have become a staple of White House and congressional races as fund-raisers calibrate how to increase their open rate with piteous cries for help or with chatty “getting back to you” subject lines. Thankfully, the second fund-raising quarter of 2015 ended Tuesday night with the turn of the calendar to July, meaning the endless stream of imploring emails should taper off for a few weeks at least. Considering the current near saturation level, one can only imagine what 2016 will be like. — Carl Hulse Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who said he would push for term limits for justices after the Supreme Court’s same-sex marriage ruling, is making his attack part of his campaign strategy, The Hill writes. Ms. Warren, who many liberals had hoped would run against Mrs. Clinton, offered some support for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, The Boston Herald reports, saying “I love what Bernie is talking about.” And Mr. Graham told The Atlantic that were he to be elected president he would most likely send more troops into the Middle East to battle the Islamic State, a policy that the publication said was part of a “cheerful belligerence.” Mr. Huckabee‘s claim that shootings are up under Bill de Blasio, New York’s liberal mayor, does not stand up to scrutiny, The Washington Post reports. In the emails released by the State Department, Mrs. Clinton appeared eager to be kept posted on the details of how the news media covered her international trips, right down to discussions of her wardrobe. In a Nov. 19, 2009, email titled “Love the coat!” Philip J. Crowley, the assistant secretary for public affairs, told Mrs. Clinton a photo of her arrival in Kabul landed on the front page of The New York Times “and sparked an online poll in Huff Post about your coat.” “At last check,” he said, “its favorability rating was 77 percent.” Mrs. Clinton replied: “I bought the coat in Kabul in â03 and thought it should get a chance to go home for a visit!” — Amy Chozick
