When Republican presidential candidates gather in California for their second debate next week, it could be a little awkward. The ability to deliver a well-crafted political insult is a necessary skill when it comes to running for office, but this week the zingers have rapidly zagged from the political to the personal to the nasty. In 2008, then-Senator Barack Obama was criticized for being overly harsh when he said with a smirk that Hillary Rodham Clinton, his opponent for the Democratic nomination, was “likable enough.”Â Such a jab seems like a pat on the back compared to the verbal fisticuffs displayed by this year’s crop of Republican hopefuls, in large part thanks to the emergence of Donald J. Trump. In an interview published Wednesday, Mr. Trump suggestedÂ that Carly Fiorina was too ugly to be president. “Look at that face!” Trump told Rolling Stone magazine as Ms. Fiorina appeared on TV. “Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president.”Â He later said that he was talking about her “persona.” Mr. Trump also unloaded on Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who is gaining on him in several polls. On Wednesday, Mr. Carson saidÂ that Mr. Trump did not appear to be humble enough to be a God-fearing Christian. Mr. Trump responded by suggesting that Mr. Carson was an “O.K.” doctor but had no business running for president and, slamming him and Jeb Bush at the same time, claimedÂ that Mr. Carson made Mr. Bush look like “the Energizer bunny.” Looking to jump into the fray, and perhaps get some much needed publicity, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana delivered the toughestÂ attack on Mr. Trump to date. In a speech to the National Press Club, Mr. Jindal called Mr. Trump a “narcissist” and an “egomaniacal madman” who had no principles. For good measure, he later went on CBS and said that Mr. Trump’s hairstyle looks like a squirrel is sitting on his head. Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton, who has avoided criticizing her Democratic opponents, was happy to mock Gov. Scott Walker, the Wisconsin Republican, this week. In a speech in his home state, she raised questions about his leadership and his choice of transportation and implied that his macho image was just an act. “Governor Walker thinks because he busts unions, starves universities, guts public education, demeans women, scapegoats teachers, nurses and firefighters, he is some kind of tough guy on his motorcycle — a real leader,” she said. Firing back on Twitter, Mr. Walker pointed to Mrs. Clinton’s affinity for the high life. .@HillaryClinton your affinity for flying private jets on taxpayers dime is well known.

A young Theodore Roosevelt once called former President Benjamin Harrison “a cold-blooded, narrow-minded, prejudiced, obstinate, timid, old psalm-singing Indianapolis politician.â When Gerald Ford faced off against Ronald Reagan for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976, he made Mr. Reagan’s hair color a campaign issue, saying, “Ronald Reagan doesn’t dye his hair, he’s just prematurely orange.” And in 1988, Ann Richards delivered a stinging blow to George H. W. Bush, then the nominee of the Republican Party, when she said during the Democratic convention, âPoor George, he canât help it; he was born with a silver foot in his mouth.â Political insults can sometimes backfire, and there were signs this week that Mr. Trump might be taking things too far. The conservative talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh, who has praised Mr. Trump’s moxie, suggested that Mr. Trump shouldÂ get back to the issues. Some callers to the show suggested that the billionaire developerÂ was starting to sound like a schoolyard bully. But Mr. Trump, the author of a book entitled “The Art of the Comeback,” has so far shown little interest in tempering his responses. Oh wow, lightweight Governor @BobbyJindal, who is registered at less than 1 percent in the polls, just mocked my hair. So original! — Donald J.
