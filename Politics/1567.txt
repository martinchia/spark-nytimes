DES MOINES — Fresh off her first major campaign rally in New York City, Hillary Rodham Clinton flew to Iowa on Saturday evening to urge Democrats to sign on to her presidential team rather than remain open to overtures from the growing political operations of Bernie Sanders and Martin OâMalley, two rivals also working intently here. In remarks that drew an implicit contrast between her aspirations and President Obamaâs record, Mrs. Clinton told 50 people in Sioux City — in an appearance that was simulcast to about 650 house parties nationwide — that she wanted to âwork with you to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top.â âIt took a lot to recover from the Great Recession,â she said in a nod to Mr. Obamaâs economic policies. âNow we are standing again, but we are not yet running.â As with her rally in New York, Mrs. Clinton was light on policy details, promising to lay out a detailed agenda in the coming weeks. Instead, she sought to energize voters by presenting herself as a fighter who would never stop pushing the interests of working-class and middle-class Americans. âI donât believe we should ever quit on our country — itâs given too much to us,â she said. Mrs. Clinton concluded by urging âeach and every one of you at every house party around the countryâ to go to her campaign website and join her bid. At Clinton house parties in Des Moines and elsewhere, guests were met at front doors with so-called commitment cards they are asked to sign as a way of pledging to support Mrs. Clinton in the Feb. 1 Iowa caucuses, to volunteer for her campaign or to follow her on Twitter and Facebook. Clinton supporters at the Des Moines party repeatedly urged the 40 guests to sign them or add their names to the sign-in sheet for the event. While it was not mandatory to sign a card in order to attend the house party and watch Mrs. Clinton in Sioux City, the outreach was aggressive. âBefore you leave, I hope youâll sign a card that commits you,â said the host of the Des Moines party, State Representative Marti Anderson. A few moments later, she added, âIâm asking you to commit to Hillary.â Pam Whitmore, a retired teacher who helped organize a bloc of Clinton supporters during the 2008 Iowa caucuses, said she was a little surprised that the Democrats were pushing commitment cards so forcefully so early in the race. âI guess people believe that we have one strong candidate this year, so everyone should get behind her quickly,â said Ms. Whitmore, who is supporting Mrs. Clinton again. âBut usually you give people a little time to listen to the candidates and make up their own mind.â Earlier on Saturday, Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator and staunch liberal who is running second to Mrs. Clinton in some early Iowa polls, officially opened a campaign headquarters in Des Moines during a three-day campaign swing in the state. Mr. Sanders has only a handful of paid staff members in Iowa, and Mr. OâMalley, a former governor of Maryland, is also just starting to build his operation, while Mrs. Clinton already has aides and organizers spread across the state. Yet Mr. Sanders has drawn the largest crowds of any candidate so far, though Mrs. Clinton is looking to surpass him with a major rally here at the Iowa State Fairgrounds on Sunday. And of course, she is looking to win the caucuses this time around, after coming in third in 2008 behind Mr. Obama and John Edwards.
