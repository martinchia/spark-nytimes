New Hampshireâs First Congressional District is one of the nationâs dwindling number of genuine swing districts â and, in recent elections, it has bounced back and forth between the same two candidates, with the incumbent losing each time.  Now, it appears that the Democrat in the tug-of-war, Carol Shea-Porter, will seek the seat once again, raising the intriguing possibility of yet another rematch. Ms. Shea-Porter was first elected when she was a little-known social worker in 2006. She and Frank Guinta, a Republican and the former mayor of Manchester, N.H., have faced off three times â in 2010, 2012 and 2014 â trading the seat as their parties traded fortunes nationally in each election. Mr. Guinta was victorious in 2014, but his term has not exactly been smooth. This year, he settled a 2010 campaign finance violation with the Federal Election Commission, which led members of his own party, including Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and even the conservative editorial page of The New Hampshire Union-Leader, to call for his resignation.  Mr. Guinta resisted and has since made fund-raising pitches that appear aimed at a 2016 campaign. On Monday, a tweet from Ms. Shea-Porter indicated that she has filed paperwork that would allow her to throw her hat back in the ring. “As the congresswoman has said, she will run in the special election when House Republican leaders finish reviewing the case and Congressman Guinta resigns. She has filed to prepare to run,â said Naomi Andrews, a spokeswoman for Ms. Shea-Porter. âThe filing also allows for a 2016 option.” When asked for comment, Mr. Guintaâs chief of staff, Jay Ruais, refrained from mentioning Ms. Shea-Porter by name. âCongressman Guinta remains focused on collaborating with Granite Staters to devise solutions and fix the problems we face in New Hampshire,â said Mr. Ruais, adding that Mr. Guinta will run for re-election. The violation in question took place during Mr. Guintaâs primary campaign in 2009 and 2010, when he made loans to his campaign committee totaling $355,000. Mr. Guinta has said the money was his own, but he admitted in the settlement that it came from an account bearing his parentsâ names, making it an excessive and illegal campaign donation. Mr. Guinta and Ms. Shea-Porter are expected to face primary opponents should they run in 2016. Dan Innis, a businessman who has previously run for the Republican nomination in the district, has said he is exploring another candidacy; Shawn OâConnor, the founder of a test preparation company, is running as a Democrat.
