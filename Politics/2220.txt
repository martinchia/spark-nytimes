Two âsuper PACsâ that support Hillary Rodham Clinton have agreed to raise money together, in a show of unity that could make it simpler for donors to give to both. Correct the Record, run by Mrs. Clintonâs ally David Brock, and Priorities USA, run by her former adviser Guy Cecil, said Friday that they had formed a joint fund-raising committee called American Priorities â16. It is aimed at creating less confusion for those looking to aid Mrs. Clinton through outside groups. But it could also have the effect of making it easier for Mrs. Clinton, too, who is dealing with the super PAC landscape for the first time. She is barred from specifically requesting donations to the outside groups. But she may âsuggestâ them â and pointing to one entity is less awkward than identifying two. “If we are going to be successful, we must build a strong, united coalition that works closely together and is focused only on electing Hillary Clinton next November,â Mr. Cecil said in an email.  Under the agreement, 20 percent of what gets raised through American Priorities â16, for gifts of up to $1 million, will go to Correct the Record; the remaining 80 percent will go to Priorities USA. For gifts of $1 million or more, $200,000 would go to Correct the Record, and the rest to Priorities USA. A similar agreement between Priorities USA and another super PAC, American Bridge, was discussed in 2011 to support President Obamaâs re-election, but was never reached. Mr. Brock also proposed such an arrangement months ago, before Mr. Cecil took over at Priorities USA. The joint fund-raising committee will not pay commissions to those who solicit donations. Priorities USA, which has experienced upheaval at times over the last two years, is now seeking eight-figure checks to help bolster Mrs. Clinton in response to a flood of money pouring into Republican outside groups. Priorities is also expanding its board, adding the veteran fund-raiser Brian Wolff and Miguel Rodriguez, a former legislative director to Mr. Obama. “Brian and Miguel are two of the most well-known and well-respected leaders in politics and we are thrilled to have them join our growing team of supporters,” Mr. Cecil said in a statement Friday. Meanwhile, amid a potentially fractured array of super PACs on the Republican side, Priorities appears to be forging ties with a roster of independent but like-minded groups, according to people familiar with the talks, who were not authorized to speak publicly. Priorities USA filed its first six monthsâ financial report on Friday, showing that it received in-kind donations for polling research from Barbara F. Lee, of the Barbara Lee Foundation, which promotes female candidates in office. There was also a rental of $150,000 to Ready for Hillary, the group that had worked to try to build a list of supporters of Mrs. Clinton that she could tap into once she was a candidate. Priorities USA reported that it raised about $15 million so far this year. Priorities had roughly 30 donors, the filings showed.
