Common Core is Jeb Bush’s Achilles’ heel when it comes to courting many conservatives, and on Wednesday the former Florida governor treaded carefully over the subject.  Asked about the subject at an education policy forum in New Hampshire, Mr. Bush acknowledged the continuing debate surrounding the set of standards: “What’s that? Common Core?” Mr. Bush has been a backer of Common Core, but as many Republicans detest it as government imposition on schools he has taken an increasingly flexible approach. “If people donât like Common Core, fine,” Mr. Bush said. “Just make sure your standards are much higher than they were before.” Mr. Bush went on to say that education standards should not be federally driven but that the federal government should partner with states to help improve standards. Recognizing that more government guidance does not necessarily mean greater academic achievement, Mr. Bush said that simpler standards that focus on critical thinking are necessary. However, Mr. Bush did not suggest doing away with testing students. “If you don’t measure, you basically don’t care,” he said. “We should make sure there is at least some way of measuring student progress.” Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
