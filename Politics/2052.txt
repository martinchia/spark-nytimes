More than 18 million people tuned in to CNN to watch the Republican candidates for president on Tuesday, the third-highest viewership in history for a nominating debate, according to Nielsen data provided by the cable network. CNN also delivered the debate to the Web, mobile apps and connected TVs, registering at least 3.1 million live streams, according to the network. Usage peaked at 815,000 concurrent streams at 9:45 p.m. Tuesday’s debate, moderated by Wolf Blitzer, was the second-most-watched program in CNN history, ranking behind an earlier Republican debate in September and signaling continued intense interest in the 2016 presidential election. Viewership for the first two Republican debates this election cycle â the first on Fox News, then on CNN â was more than 23 million each. The Democratic debate on CNN in October was the fourth-most-watched presidential nominating debate in history with nearly 15.5 million viewers.
