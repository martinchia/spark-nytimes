HOOKSETT, N.H. â The exchange began inauspiciously. âUnlike you, I do not believe that my life was divinely inspired,â said the young man, standing in the middle of a Jeb Bush event on Tuesday night, as he pointedly asked Mr. Bush if he thought religious references should be removed from the White House.  âDoes it offend you that I express my view that life is a gift from God?â Mr. Bush responded. The two men â one the former governor of Florida, the other a 19-year-old student at Union College in New York â seemed to talk past each other at points, with Mr. Bush explaining this his religion allows âpeople to know whatâs in my heartâ and the student, Ari Bennett, trying to argue for a more clear separation between religion and government. But the back-and-forth also provided a personal glimpse into the life of Mr. Bush, who is Roman Catholic, and the religion that plays a quiet if omnipresent part of his daily routine. Mr. Bush reiterated that he did not mean to offend Mr. Bennett, and said he does not judge others who donât share is faith. But he explained that, as a candidate for president, he feels itâs appropriate to share his religious underpinnings with voters. âIâm a public person aspiring for public office,â he said. âIâm not saying that Iâm going to impose my religion on you as president of the United States. But Iâm running for president and I want people to know whatâs in my heart. I want people to know how I make decisions, how I view life itself, and I think thatâs more than appropriate.â Moments later, Mr. Bush â who said he says a prayer each morning when he wakes up â added, âI will continue to kind of give people what my moral architecture is, how I make decisions.â  Then he paused, fishing around in his pants pocket. âI actually carry little Baby Jesus here with me because itâs my strength,â he said, producing a figurine of Jesus, in what looked like a manger, in his palm.  âThis is an arduous process, man.â The crowd applauded, as he finished: âIâm just trying to explain me. And you explained you. And I respect you.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
