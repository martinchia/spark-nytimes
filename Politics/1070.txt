Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These areÂ the places, faces and culinary selectionsÂ of 2016âs first proper bus tour. EVENT 16 Time: 4:29 p.m., Jan. 7 Place: Webster City, Iowa (population: 8,070) Site: A modest airplane hangar, with a small propeller plane that some used as a coat rack. Mood: pleasantly awaiting takeoff Cruelest protester sign: âTed Cruz Likes Nickelbackâ Stephen Sondheim echo: âA funny thing happened on the way to the forum,â Mr. Cruz told reporters, describing the state of the Republican race. Highlight: Mr. Cruz does not let a stump speech pass without the locust joke. Years back, he said, he was in West Texas discussing the differences between regulators and locusts. âThe thing is,â he said, âyou canât use pesticide on the regulators.â An old farmer leaned back, Mr. Cruz recalled, and accepted the challenge: âWanna bet?â the man said, according to Mr. Cruzâs thick drawl. The crowd chuckled reliably. Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
