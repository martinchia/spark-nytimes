Hillary Rodham Clintonâs relations with the political news media had been tense long before she declared her candidacy in April, and her campaign’s efforts to try and improve those relations have backfired at times. On Thursday, Bill Clinton provided a candid look at how the former first couple felt about the role the news media played in the presidential campaign. At a joint event in Dallas alongside George W. Bush, Mr. Clinton said that part of the nationâs problem was a news media driven by the belief that âconflict is better than concord.â Mr. Bush blamed the political divisiveness on candidatesâ impassioned surrogates and the Internet granting them a veil of anonymity to hurl nasty attacks. But Mr. Clinton ultimately put the blame squarely on the political press.  âLetâs suppose we were in a campaign against each other,â he said to his predecessor. âHe would have his narrative and I would have mine and each of us would try to convince you that our narrative was better than the other. Thatâs O.K.  âBut the people covering the campaign, they develop a narrative, too, a storyline, and itâs almost impossible for the real story to be the same as the storyline,â Mr. Clinton said. âItâs very hard for the American people to be well informed if the storyline swamps the real story.â Mr. Clinton did not specifically mention Mrs. Clinton’s campaign (except for saying “I know who I want to win”) and he did not discuss recent articles about her use of private email at the State Department and foreign donations to the Clinton Foundation. His comments come just days after Mrs. Clinton tried to begin a more accessible phase in the campaign, by sitting down on Tuesday with CNNâs Brianna Keilar in her first national interview. In his remarks, Mr. Clinton also echoed a frequent and widely held complaint that the political press is too focused on the horse race of who is ahead in the campaign rather than policy and issues.
