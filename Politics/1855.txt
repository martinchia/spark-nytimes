                                        The Republican convention is playing a recording of President Obama saying &apos;&apos;You didn&apos;t build that&apos;&apos; -- but his words have been selectively edited in a way that changes their meaning.  
                                        The recording being played over loudspeakers in Tampa makes it sound as if the president had said: &apos;&apos;Let me tell you something, if you&apos;ve got a business -- you didn&apos;t build that. Somebody else made that happen.&apos;&apos; Small business
                                        owners are then quoted taking umbrage at his remarks and saying that they worked hard to build their businesses.  
                                        But the unedited quote from the president tells a somewhat different story. Mr. Obama, who was at a campaign event last month at a fire station in Roanoke, Va., actually said: &apos;&apos;Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you&apos;ve got a business
                                        -- you didn&apos;t build that. Somebody else made that happen.&apos;&apos;  
                                        None of the business owners quoted at the convention seem to mention anything about paying for their own roads and bridges. MICHAEL COOPER
