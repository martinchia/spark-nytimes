NORTH MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. â Kenneth G. Langone, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot who was a leading supporter of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, has thrown his support behind Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, the Kasich campaign said Thursday. Mr. Langone, a coveted fund-raiser within the Republican Party, had pushed Mr. Christie to seek the presidency in 2012. Mr. Christie dropped out of this yearâs race on Wednesday after finishing sixth in New Hampshire. âHe’s as big a get as you can get in both the fund-raising and business world, and so we’re very happy and honored to have him join us,â John Weaver, Mr. Kasichâs chief strategist, told reporters Thursday on a conference call. Mr. Langone could not be reached for comment.  Mr. Weaver said Mr. Langone would help raise money for the campaign. Fund-raising has been a challenge for Mr. Kasich; his campaign had only $2.5 million as of the end of December. In 2008, Mr. Lagone threw his financial weight behind former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, who also pulled out of the presidential race early after suffering defeats in the initial contests.
