Amid all the talk of using walls, drones and guns to bolster security at the southern border, a project to tie the United States and Mexico closer together has been racing toward completion. On Tuesday, Penny Pritzker, the secretary of commerce, will travel to Brownsville, Tex., to inaugurate the first new rail crossing between the countries in more than a century. The $100 million project has been in the works since 2004 and is intended to move goods more efficiently across the border. The West Rail International Bridge is one of several new developments that Ms. Pritzker has been promoting to help ease trade with Mexico, the United Statesâ second-largest trading partner. The new bridge comes as Republican presidential candidates have been taking hard lines on immigration and seemingly competing with one another over who would build a bigger wall faster. Ms. Pritzker said in an interview that the countries were increasingly taking steps to share intelligence at the border, and she said that smuggling and illegal crossings had declined as trade had ramped up. âFor too long weâve been thinking about the U.S.-Mexico relationship being one about security,â Ms. Pritzker said, adding that trade had created jobs and growth to both countries. âI wish we spent more time talking about how we grow our economic bond,â she said.
