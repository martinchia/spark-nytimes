The final decision was made only in the last few days, but word of turmoil in Jeb Bushâs organization, and a coming change, had been in the air for weeks.  On Monday, Mr. Bush’s aides announced a shuffling of the deck, with David Kochel, the veteran Iowa operative who was expected to be campaign manager, moved to the chief strategist role. Danny Diaz, a Washington-based communications strategist who had been involved with media issues, will become the campaign manager.  “Danny is the guy you want in the trench with you when going to war,” said Ana Navarro, a friend of Mr. Bush who lives in Miami and has seen the new campaign manager on the road with the soon-to-be-candidate. “He has good chemistry with Jeb.” For Mr. Kochel, the new role, which includes building a political apparatus, is said to play better to his strengths than campaign manager would. Mr. Diaz, who brings a level of high intensity to every campaign job he’s held, is said to have a good rapport with Sally Bradshaw, Mr. Bush’s former chief-of-staff and political lifeline of two decades, who, according to several people involved in the effort, will ultimately be running the show.  Mr. Bush and his aides held a series of meetings last week in Miami with much of the campaign, including operatives from the early states.  The sessions included presentations and descriptions about how to move forward once he was a declared candidate. The public mood was upbeat, and Mike Murphy, who has advised Mr. Bush since his first, unsuccessful race in 1994, shot footage of Mr. Bush and his wife, Columba, for future political advertisements.  But beneath the surface, there were rumblings that a change was imminent. Incoming staff member traded whispers about whether Scott Jennings, a former George W. Bush White House official who was present for the meetings, was still in line to be the political director, and whether Mr. Kochel would be left in place. (Mr. Jennings will now serve as an outside political adviser but will not relocate to Miami as a full-time aide).  The decision about the change in roles was finalized late last week, according to people with knowledge of the timeline, who were not authorized to speak publicly about internal deliberations.  As has often been the case in Mr. Bush’s world, there was an intensive hunt for who was leaking information once news organizations became aware that meetings were taking place â likely the last ones before the various staffers were separated by a firewall imposed by campaign finance laws barring coordination between campaigns and “super PACs.” That firewall formally went into place on June 4, people briefed on the move said.  Making matters even more complicated for Mr. Bush, his advisers have been geographically separated: Ms. Bradshaw lives in Tallahassee, Mr. Murphy is in Los Angeles and Mr. Kochel and the campaign are based in Miami.  Mr. Murphy, who has a wife and a young child in Los Angeles, is planning to house the super PAC there. Trying to minimize the travel for various schedules and balance logistical issues for people coming from so many distances, Mr. Murphy has occasionally held strategy meetings in a Dallas airport terminal.  Mr. Bushâs aides are hopeful that some of their challenges may subside with the changes in place, and with a formal announcement just days away.
