MANCHESTER, N.H. — Senator Marco Rubio of Florida interrupted his usual stump speech about America at the brink, the threat of the Islamic State and the perfidy of President Obama to explain why he loves the new Geico ad. “You know, the one where the guy is fighting on the roof?” Mr. Rubio asked. He elaborated. “Have you seen this one? His mom calls him.” The crowd at St. Anselm College here laughed knowingly. By now, they have all seen the spot, featuring (in Geico’s words) “a Bond-style hero being sweetly interrupted by a phone call from his delightful mom.” Mr. Rubio has apparently watched it many times. “I love the line, ‘The squirrels are back. Your dad doesnât want to call the exterminator. This time itâs personal.'” The audience roared. (Note to sticklers: he paraphrased her.) Mr. Rubio said, half-jokingly, that he wanted to recruit the ad-making team that created the commercial for the insurance giant. “I have to get those people on my campaign,” he said.  Then he stopped himself. “I am way off topic,” he said.
