The staff members of Sylviaâs Restaurant in Harlem, where pictures of Democrats hang on the walls, wiped down the outdoor tables on Wednesday as Ben Carson sat in a black S.U.V.  âWhoâs here?â asked a tall woman in a black tank top as she passed by. âBen Carson,â a voice yelled. The woman walked away.  Mr. Carson, who is climbing in the Iowa polls after a quiet but well-received performance in the Republican presidential debate last week, traveled to New York to meet with business and community leaders at a private event space operated by Sylvia’s.  His campaign said he would “discuss his renewed vision for an inclusive and revived America” and his plan to address the “high double-digit unemployment rate in urban communities” and “inconceivably high incarceration rates.”  The meeting and meal lasted about two hours behind windows covered in gold curtains. Deana Bass, his press secretary, would not name who was at the meeting. But she said that Mr. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon who has not held public office and is still introducing himself to the public, would answer questions, then take a walk around the neighborhood. Mr. Carson covered a lot of ground.  Sylvia’s green beans, he told reporters, “were smacking,” and the United States needed “to use every resource to get rid of” the Islamic State.  “We need to wipe them out,” he said. “Right now.” âWe take the land from them, we take their oil from them,â he added, echoing comments on Tuesday from Donald J. Trump, the current leader in the Republican polls. Mr. Carson also addressed the Black Lives Matter movement, calling the protests unnecessary âstrife.â Instead, he said, âWe need to be talking about how we solve the problem in the black community of murder.” The solution, he said, was to âinstill values into people again so they do in fact believe that their brotherâs life matters.” He defined those values as “family and faith,” the âprinciples that got black people through slavery, segregation and Jim Crowism.â Alton Darden, 68, who, like Mr. Carson, grew up in Detroit, does not agree. âHe does not stand for the things that I do,â said Mr. Darden, who was in New York on vacation with his granddaughter and was standing nearby. âSometimes I feel he is anti-black, and he is a black man,â he added. âI am disappointed.â A short time later, after his team briefly considered canceling the neighborhood walk, and amid grumbles from the gathered reporters, Mr. Carson started moving south on Lenox Avenue at 126th Street.  âIt actually looks very nice, like part of Manhattan, like Midtown,â Mr. Carson said to John Burnett, who organized the event, and William Brown Jr., a longtime Harlem resident, who had attended the meeting. âThis used to be a desert, if you will,â  Mr. Brown said.  The walk lasted about a block, but it didnât stop people from approaching Mr. Carson. A man stopped to thank him. He had read his memoir, he told Mr. Carson, and it had helped him in school. âThat was the key,â the man told Mr. Carson, with an arm around his shoulder.   âNow youâre going to help the younger people, right?â Mr. Carson asked.  âAbsolutely,” the man responded. “Whatâs important is to stop the gun violence.â   âI love it,â Mr. Carson said, before being swept away by his team to continue the walk.  At 125th Street, Mr. Carson came upon the Marching Cobras, a community marching band performing to raise money for equipment and uniforms. Mr. Carson stopped and watched for a moment, expressionless. Then he turned and walked back the way he came.
