A “super PAC” supporting Hillary Clinton said on Wednesday that it had collected $11.8 million dollars in March and had $44.7 million in cash on hand. The group, Priorities USA Action, is expected to lead outside spending on behalf of Mrs. Clinton if she becomes the Democratic presidential nominee. Donors have pledged another $49 million in contributions, said a spokesman for the group, Justin Barasky. The totals were first reported by CNN. Banking on Mrs. Clinton’s increasingly likely victory in the Democratic primary contest, and those pledges, the group has begun reserving $125 million in television and digital advertising for the general election campaign — a significant sum this early in the race. The early move may help it get more advertising for its dollar than if it waited until later, when prices rise. More information on the group’s finances, including the identities of its most recent donors, will be contained in Federal Election Commission forms due by the end of Wednesday.
