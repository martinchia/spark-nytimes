You are not invited to Christmas at President Obamaâs house. But now, thanks to social media, you can listen to some of his favorite holiday songs on your own. The White House on Wednesday released holiday playlists from the Obama family and the family of Vice President Joseph R. Biden on Spotify, the music-streaming site where users can curate their own selections and share them with friends.   Mr. Obamaâs holiday playlist is an eclectic mix,  including Big Band and Motown classics, lots of jazz and a bit of gospel. Artists range from Frank Sinatra (âThe First Noelâ) to Destinyâs Child (â8 Days of Christmas”).  There are decades-old favorites including âO Tannenbaum,â by the Vince Guaraldi Trio, the jazzy version that plays during the television show, âA Charlie Brown Christmas;â as well as Nat King Coleâs âThe Christmas Songâ and Eartha Kittâs âSanta Baby.â There is also Stevie Wonderâs âSomeday at Christmasâ and the Jackson 5âs version of âSanta Clause is Coming to Town.â Pop divas Mariah Carey (âAll I Want for Christmas is Youâ) and Whitney Houston (âLittle Drummer Boyâ) have cameos, along with Boyz II Men singing âLet It Snow.â Sharing the list was more evidence of the White Houseâs strategy of using social media to burnish Mr. Obamaâs image, to try to humanize him and allow the president to relate to a wider swath of the public â including young people who devote much of their time to technology-powered engagement than traditional news outlets can reach. The playlists also show the differing musical tastes of Mr. Obama, 54, and Mr. Biden, 73. The vice presidentâs list is stacked with rock ‘n’ roll, both classic and soft, as well as Bruce Springsteen, Neil Diamond, Kenny Loggins and Tom Petty.  There is also some opera and two songs by Tony Bennett on Mr. Biden’s list.  It also includes Coldplayâs âA Sky Full of Stars,â an homage to his late son Beau Biden, a passionate fan of the British rock band who passed away this year at the age of 46 after battling brain cancer. The Bidens on Friday will celebrate their first Christmas without Beau.
