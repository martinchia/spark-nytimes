Former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia kept a relatively low profile before announcing his presidential candidacy, and while his poll numbers barely register in many surveys, he brings a diverse background that could appeal to Democratic voters looking for a candidate who is more than a career politician. Who is Mr. Webb? Warrior: Mr. Webb studied at the United States Naval Academy and graduated in 1968. He went on to serve as rifle platoon and company commander in Vietnam. His awards included the Navy Cross, the Silver Star Medal, two Bronze Star Medals, and two Purple Hearts. He served as secretary of the Navy under President Ronald Reagan. Military service runs deep in the Webb family. Mr. Webb’s father was an Air Force officer in World War II, and his ancestors fought in the Civil War. Writer: Mr. Webb has written 10 books, including several war novels. HeÂ is also an accomplished journalist, winning an Emmy award in 1983 for a report he produced on the Lebanese civil war for PBS’s âMacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour.â  Senator: Mr. Webb served in the Senate from 2007 to 2012. He made veterans’ issues a priority and focused on foreign affairs, making a high-profile trip to Myanmar in 2009 to help secure the release of an American prisoner. He was chairman of the Foreign Relations Committeeâs Asia-Pacific Subcommittee. On domestic affairs, Mr. Webb has been a strong proponent of reforming the criminal justice system. Personal life: Mr. Webb has six children and has been married three times. His wife, Hong Le Webb, is a securities lawyer and was born in Vietnam. Despite Mr. Webb’s strong and varied credentials, he does have several weak spots that rivals will target if he begins to make headway in the polls. Mr. Webb has faced criticism for making improper payments from his political action committee to his wife and daughter; he has expressed skepticism about affirmative action; and his appreciation for firearms has been seen as out of step with a Democratic Party that has made gun control a core value.
