MOBILE, Ala. â By midday Friday, with the temperature in the high 80s, Keith Quackenbush and Bill Hart decided it was time to buy an $89 pop-up tent from a nearby Walmart. It was how, they said, they were going to endure the wait outside a football stadium ahead of an appearance by Donald J. Trump, the Republican presidential candidate. The two had arrived outside Ladd-Peebles Stadium before 7 a.m. on Friday, more than 12 hours before Mr. Trumpâs scheduled rally. âWeâre tired of seeing whatâs going on with our country,â Mr. Quackenbush, 54, a retail manager from Pensacola, Fla., said as he waited in a lawn chair. âWeâre tired of politicians running their lips, doing nothing, promising everything and doing absolutely nothing.â Mr. Quackenbush and Mr. Hart, whose tent included an American flag and a âDonât tread on meâ flag, were hardly alone in the Alabama heat.  Behind them, Amanda Mancini, 33, said she had flown in from California to see Mr. Trump. Behind her, just beyond the tentâs shade, a black woman wearing a University of Alabama shirt waited quietly, followed soon after by a white man sporting Auburn University paraphernalia. And so it went, with plenty of chatter about just how many people would actually show up to a stadium with a capacity of more than 40,000. âWe completely rearranged our schedule,â said Mr. Hart, 46, who works with Mr. Quackenbush. âIt was like: âOh, no. Got to be there if Trumpâs that close.ââ He added, âIâve never stood in line for a phone. Iâve never stood in line for a Black Friday event. Thereâs been stuff I wanted, but nothingâs been worth waiting for. But I see a big change coming for the country, and I want to be part of the change.â
