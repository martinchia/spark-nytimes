Pray for Ted Cruz. That appears to be among the chief tasks to be undertaken by the Cruz campaignâs ânational prayer team,â a group announced on Thursday and scheduled to begin its work next month. Mr. Cruz, who has aggressively courted the support of evangelicals, said the creation of the team would âestablish a direct line of communication between our campaign and the thousands of Americans who are lifting us up before the Lord.â Group members will receive emails containing prayer requests and a short devotional every week, the campaign said. They will also be invited to take part in a 20-minute âprayer conference callâ each Tuesday. Mr. Cruz has placed the subject of religious freedom, and what he sees as attacks against it, at the center of his campaign, holding major religious rallies in Iowa and South Carolina and appearing regularly at churches. Mr. Cruzâs spokesman, Rick Tyler, suggested the prayer teamâs aim was far more modest. âI donât have a political or tactical angle on it,â he said. âIt is what it is. Itâs a group of people who wanted to get together and pray for Ted and his wife and the nation as a whole.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
