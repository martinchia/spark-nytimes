The conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch will sit down for an interview with MSNBCâs Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski to air next week, bringing their campaign to soften their image to a cable news network known for its more liberal-leaning political slant. The taped interview, which will air next Tuesday on “Morning Joe” (6-9 a.m.), will take place at the brothersâ childhood home in Wichita, Kan. The conversation will focus on the role of money in politics, the network said in a news release.  The appearance continues an effort by the Koch brothers to alter the public perception of them, advanced by many Democrats, as a secretive force behind many of the Republican Partyâs most conservative positions.
