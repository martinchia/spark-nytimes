Former President George W. Bush has been cautious about what he has said about the Republican presidential race, in which his brother is a candidate. He has also refrained from jumping in on various contentious issues that swirl around Donald J. Trump, who leads in most polls of the Republican field.  But a spokesman for Mr. Bush took a step toward criticizing Mr. Trump on Tuesday over his call to ban Muslim immigration into the United States. “President Bush spoke a lot about this during his presidency, and he won’t be weighing in anew now â or commenting on or giving oxygen to any of Trumpâs bluster,” said the spokesman, Freddy Ford, in an email. “You can find a wealth of President Bush’s remarks on this topic at the archived White House website.  He has always said that those who murder the innocent in order to advance a political, ideological or religious objective are not religious. They are terrorists. True Islam is peaceful; radical Islam is âthe perversion by a few of a noble faith into an ideology of terror and death.”  A day earlier, Mr. Bush’s vice president, Dick Cheney, said that Mr. Trump’s comments go against what the country stands for.
