Among his colleagues at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Dr. Ben Carson had plenty of admirers during his more than three decades as a pediatric neurosurgeon. But some of those former co-workers and longtime friends have mixed views about how Dr. Carson would perform as President Carson. One, Dr. Henry Brem, the current neurosurgery chief at Hopkins, was hesitant to offer a ringing endorsement. âI donât know,â he said. âI think that someone who has been a governor, who has run a big political system, is probably more prepared to run a massive system. Let me put it a different way, I would not make a good president. I run one of the best neurosurgery departments in the country, Iâm very proud of how I run it, but thereâs no way in the world that I would make a good president.â Dr. Brem added that Dr. Carson is âa different person than me, but I donât know if itâs a different skill set.â Carol James, Dr. Carsonâs longtime physician assistant, said that it was hard for her to imagine a Carson presidency, but that he had âcharacteristics that would be really good as a president,â including âthat heâs someone who is amazingly good at talking with people, who tries to find a solution, who doesnât go off half-cocked and make a decision.â A few colleagues said Dr. Carsonâs experience included relevant skills for the job. A former director of the neurosurgery department at Hopkins, Dr. Donlin Long, cited Dr. Carsonâs âmoral and ethical foundationâ and ability to make âimportant life and death decisions rapidlyâ as pluses. Dr. Michael Guarnieri, a former pediatric neurosurgery director at Hopkins, said, âHe ran a huge shop, heâs got administrative skills, heâs got fund-raising skills.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
