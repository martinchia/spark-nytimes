While there has been a lot of hand-wringing among conservatives about the damage they fear Donald J. Trump is doing to their brand, one centrist leader among congressional Republicans sees a potential silver lining for Mr. Trump: electability.  âThe Republicans’ presidential nominee must build a winning coalition that extends beyond the Republican base,â said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania. âRunning a campaign and expanding the coalition is an exercise in addition, not subtraction.â  Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who has been chasing Mr. Trump in the polls in early primary states, is popular among religious conservatives and hard-right Republican voters. But Mr. Trumpâs unusual bloc, such that it is, pulls in registered Democrats and other nontraditional Republican primary voters. Indeed, some polling has shown overlap in views among those who favor Mr. Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.  âTed Cruz is a rigid ideologue,â said Mr. Dent, who is not supporting Trump and has yet to endorse anyone. âDonald Trump is ideologically scattered and malleable. In my view, a more rigid ideology would have a much harder time assembling a winning general election coalition than the less doctrinaire candidate.â In some ways, Mr. Dentâs views reflect a widespread antipathy toward Mr. Cruz among his Republican colleagues in Congress, one he has worn as an anti-Washington badge of honor, insider though he may well be.  But Mr. Dent, who wants to see his party appeal to independents, has the same fears that have been plaguing the party generally for years, and ones that Mr. Trumpâs anti-Muslim views may not quell.  âSome Republican presidential candidates are in demographic denial,â he said. âWinning a larger percentage of the conservative white vote in 2016 is neither a viable nor realistic general election strategy.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
