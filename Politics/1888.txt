Carly Fiorina, facing questions about the accuracy of her comments describing undercover Planned Parenthood videos, issued a sharp defense on Friday before a conservative forum in Greenville, S.C.,  insisting that the images she described were real. One of Mrs. Fiorinaâs most memorable moments at the Republican debate on Wednesday came when she dared President Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton to watch the videos, which have prompted calls to eliminate the groupâs funding. âWatch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain,â she said on Wednesday. Democrats quickly seized on the comments, suggesting that the video Mrs. Fiorina seemed to be referring to did not match her description. That video shows a still image of a fetus being held outside the womb, but not of a fetus squirming, as she describes. There was also no indication that the fetus shown was about to have its brain removed. The video is among thousands of hours of footage that an anti-abortion group has collected as part of an investigation into Planned Parenthood. On Friday, Mrs. Fiorina expressed astonishment that anyone had questioned her comments. âHonestly, I went on national television the morning after the debate and George Stephanopoulos of ABC News told me that I was mistaken, that the tapes donât exist, that the images arenât real,â she said. âWell, yes, ladies and gentlemen, they are real and I will issue my charge again.â Mrs. Fiorina has sided with hard-liners in her party who would promote a budget showdown with Mr. Obama over Planned Parenthoodâs funding. On Friday, she suggested that any discussion of a government shutdown should be reframed, with Mr. Obama as the prospective culprit. âPresident Obama, if youâre prepared to shut down the government to defend this kind of barbarity,” she said, “have at it, and explain it to the American people.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
