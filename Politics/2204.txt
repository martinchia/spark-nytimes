A new TV ad from the “super PAC” supporting former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland is titled “Wall Street’s Public Enemy No. 1.” But it seems the intended target of the ad is Hillary Rodham Clinton and Jeb Bush. The ad from Generation Forward splices excerpts from Mr. O’Malley’s recent presidential announcement speech, centered around his suggestion that the head of Goldman Sachs would be “just fine with either Bush or a Clinton.” It then repeats his criticism that “the presidency is not a crown to be passed back and forth by you between two royal families.” Mr. O’Malley has focused his early campaign message on the anti-Wall Street sentiment popular among the Democratic left. But Generation Forward, whileÂ staying at least on the surface in line with that theme, framed the critique around political dynasties as well. The $25,000 ad purchase will focus on the Iowa media markets of Cedar Rapids, Des Moines and Davenport, and will start airing with Thursday’s evening news. The title of the ad comes from a phrase uttered by the Fox Business Network correspondent Charles Gasparino,  who said that Mr. O’Malley is “public enemy No. 1 in in the halls of Goldman Sachs, in the halls of Black Rock, the big money management firm. All throughout Wall Street right now.”
