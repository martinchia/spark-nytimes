Good Tuesday morning from Washington, where the summer heat and the race to make the cut for the presidential debates seem to have made tempers short. With less than two weeks before the first debate and 16 months before the election itself, candidates have already been accused of breaching the proper bounds of political discourse.  Until Monday, most of the Republican-on-Republican violence in the 2016 presidential contest had been along familiar lines â Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey against Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky; Donald J. Trump against almost everybody. But the impending first presidential debate, which has a 10-candidate limit that has already prompted some attention-getting stunts, is quickly turning the Republican race into a food fight. Jeb Bush has largely refrained from overtly engaging with his Republican rivals, including doing his best to ignore Mr. Trump early on. But on Monday, he responded to comments from Mike Huckabee, who has been struggling to gain a toehold in the race, criticizing President Obama over a nuclear containment deal with Iran by invoking the Holocaust in graphic terms. Mr. Bush suggested that divisive speech was bad for the party, making it harder for a Republican to win the general election. Even as he did it, he couched his disagreement in terms of respect for Mr. Huckabee. But the reality is that, with just over a week until the debate and with a lack of clarity about who will make the cut, the internecine squabbling is only going to get worse. â Maggie Haberman Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. Mr. Christie, who has used his favored town-hall-style meetings as part of a plan to help separate himself from the pack and to overcome the challenges presented by his tenure in New Jersey, returns to New Hampshire, another central part of his strategy. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who on Monday became the first candidate to file for the South Carolina Republican primary ballot, will continue his visit in the state with a national security forum with Americans for Peace, Prosperity and Security. And Mr. Obama, who so far on his trip to Africa has shown tough love to Kenya and taken a milder tone with Ethiopia, will take part in a meeting with Ethiopian civil society activists. He will meet later with officials of the African Union before beginning his journey home. âAct on climate!â the environmental protesters chanted during Hillary Rodham Clintonâs last campaign event in New Hampshire. Message received. Mrs. Clinton will return to the state on Tuesday with a detailed plan to combat climate change, including promising a half-billion solar panels by the end of her first term, a plan to limit carbon emissions from power plants and provide enough renewable energy to power every American home by 2027. At a town-hall-style event in Nashua, N.H., Mrs. Clinton will take questions from voters and remind them of the environmental agenda she laid out on Monday. (She last visited the state on June 16 when the climate change protesters interrupted.) âI will be talking about energy and climate security, modernizing North American infrastructure, about safe and responsible production,â Mrs. Clinton said in Iowa on Monday, âespecially making sure taxpayers get a fair deal for development on public lands.â She has avoided stating whether she supports the Keystone XL pipeline, a project that liberals, including two of her Democratic opponents, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Martin OâMalley, loathe. On Monday, Mrs. Clinton deferred questions about the pipeline to the State Department. Mrs. Clintonâs visit to New Hampshire, the state that saved her husbandâs 1992 presidential campaign, comes as Mr. Sanders has surged in recent state polls. Talking about climate change and other issues that galvanize Democratic primary voters could help Mrs. Clinton gain momentum. But first, residents will want to question, and question, and question, all the candidates. â Amy Chozick While members of Congress â even proponents of previous gun safety measures â have been largely silent since the mass shootings in Charleston, S.C., Chattanooga, Tenn., and Lafayette, La., over the last two months, gun safety groups have been pressuring members to introduce new gun legislation. On Tuesday, Senators Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, Richard Blumenthal and Christopher S. Murphy, both Democrats of Connecticut, will hold a news conference with two of the groups, Everytown for Gun Safety, and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, to discuss potential legislation to expand background checks for gun buyers. Lawmakers were burned two years ago over a failure to get a similar effort off the Senate floor after 20 children were shot to death in a Connecticut school. So expect a modest focus, in which they seek more information on the recent shootings to determine whether discrete legislation would have prevented them. No Republicans are scheduled to attend. â Jennifer Steinhauer Mr. Obama was among those criticizing Mr. Huckabee for his comments on the nuclear deal with Iran, but he also assailed other candidates, including Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, for “making what he called ‘ridiculous’ claims about his policies and ‘outrageous attacks’ that crossed the line of political decorum.” The Times issued an editor’s note over coverage of Mrs. Clintonâs use of an email account that involved corrections and changes that may have left readers with a confused picture. And analysts at the National Security Agency will no longer be permitted to search a database holding five years of Americansâ domestic calling records after Nov. 29, the Obama administration said on Monday. The Atlantic takes a look at the calculus and consequences of Mr. Cruz‘s decision to play “the Maverick” on the Senate floor by, among other things, calling Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, a liar. In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Sean Spicer, the chief strategist for the Republican National Committee, writes that though the 2016 debate criteria put forth by CNN and Fox News had been criticized as too restrictive, they were a result of the committee’s efforts to improve upon previous election cycles in which the crowded events and “packed debate schedule was a disservice to the candidates â and, more important, to the voters.” And Mark Halperin at Bloomberg Politics says it is time to “stop asserting that Bernie Sanders canât beat Hillary Clinton in the Democratic nomination race.” While Republicans warn about the dangers to Israel from the Iranian nuclear deal, a poll of Jewish-Americans finds that many support the agreement. Republican strategists say that Mr. Trump‘s rise in the polls is a mirage, and reflective of inaccurate polling and a short-term media fixation, Politico reports. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin is going from cheese-head country to cheese-steak country on Tuesday as his presidential campaign tour rolls through Philadelphia. In an act of culinary diplomacy, Mr. Walker will visit both Patâs King of Steaks and Genoâs Steaks, the heralded rival purveyors of Philadelphiaâs signature sandwich. A spokeswoman for Mr. Walkerâs campaign confirmed that he would sample a cheese steak from each. Representatives of both Patâs and Genoâs said they were unaware of the governorâs visit, but the restaurants are no strangers to politicians and presidential candidates looking to taste a local delicacy. Mr. Walker will want to order carefully, however, as sandwich tourism has hampered candidates in Pennsylvania before. In 2003, John Kerry, then a Massachusetts senator, drew national scorn at his visit to Patâs for ordering his cheese steak with Swiss cheese â a faux pas that reinforced his reputation for being out of touch. During a swing through Pennsylvania in 2012, Mitt Romney was heckled for ordering a meatball âsubâ in the heart of hoagie-land. For Mr. Walker, the safe bet will be asking for his cheese steak with Cheese Whiz and onions, or âWhiz wit,” as they say in Philly. â Alan Rappeport Like the Politics Newsletter?
