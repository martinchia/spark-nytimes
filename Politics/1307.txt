It wasnât so long ago that a small congressional delegation’s trip to Cuba was a less-than-popular outing. But at least 20 lawmakers will accompany President Obama on his trip to Cuba this month, and many more asked for a seat aboard Air Force One. The group is bipartisan, demonstrating that some Republicans are coming around to the idea of ending a decades-old trade embargo, a policy Mr. Obama and President RaÃºl Castro of Cuba have pursued. âWeâre getting there,â said Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who has been an early and strong ally of Mr. Obama on the issue and is a sponsor of legislation that would end prohibitions on travel to Cuba. âIf we put that bill on the floor tomorrow,â he said, âweâd have north of 60 votes.â Mr. Flake will travel with the White House contingent, as will Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont.  The thaw between the United States and Cuba has divided Republicans and become an issue in the race for the White House. Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, both Republicans, have been sharply critical of the trip as well as Mr. Obamaâs use of executive authority to end some economic restrictions on Cuba.
