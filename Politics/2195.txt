Haim Saban, a top donor to Hillary Rodham Clinton who came out last week against the nuclear agreement between Iran and six world powers, says his comments about the deal were taken âout of context.â In an email to this reporter, Mr. Saban, who told the Israeli journalist Ayala Hasson-Nesher in an Aug. 6 radio interview that the accord was âa bad dealâ that âwe need to fight against,â said he wanted to clarify his position. âI do believe that the deal is far from perfect,â wrote Mr. Saban, who declined repeatedly to be interviewed to elaborate further on his views. âAnd âmust fight itâ is an option for the opponents to the deal. âBut that is not the issue at this point in time, because I believe the deal is now a fait accompli,” he said, calling it “a done deal.â Mr. Saban wrote, âTherefore, the United States and Israel, as staunch allies, should focus on the day after and cooperate to make sure that Iran never acquires nuclear weapons.â Mr. Sabanâs move to explain his critical comments reflects the complicated political crosscurrents of the agreement, which has created a deep divide among Democrats.  On one hand, they are facing intense pressure from President Obama, backed by antiwar and progressive groups that make up the partyâs base, to support the deal. But they are also being lobbied heavily by pro-Israel groups that oppose the deal and some major Democratic donors to reject it. The balance is particularly tricky for Mrs. Clinton, who was deeply involved in beginning the nuclear negotiations while she was secretary of state, and who needs the support of both of those forces to secure her partyâs presidential nomination. In a recent meeting with House Democrats, she embraced the deal, even though she said it was ânot perfect.â Far from it, Mr. Saban wrote in his email.
