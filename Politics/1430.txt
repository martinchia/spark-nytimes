A group of former fund-raisers and aides to President Obama â including his former advisers Julianna Smoot and Alyssa Mastromonaco â will host a fund-raiser for Hillary Rodham Clinton’s campaign this month, according to an invitation for the event.  The cocktail hour, where the guests will be the Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, the campaign’s vice chairwoman Huma Abedin and the finance director Dennis Cheng, will take place on July 27.  The hosts include familiar names from Mr. Obama’s fund-raising orbit, signifying the degree to which the president’s financial and political infrastructure has coalesced around Mrs. Clinton.  The event will be at the Brooklyn home of Hildy Kuryk, a fund-raiser on Mr. Obamaâs 2008 race and a former finance director at the Democratic National Committee, and her husband, Jarrod Bernstein, another former administration official.  Other hosts are Ms. Smoot, a top fund-raiser for Mr. Obama, Ms. Mastromonaco, who left the White House last year, as well as Anya Hoerburger, an adviser to the Democratic donor Leo Hindery.
