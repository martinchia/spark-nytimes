A major union representing government workers has endorsed Hillary Rodham Clinton, giving an infusion of support to the Democratic presidential candidate as she heads into the final months before the Iowa caucuses.  The endorsement from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which has 1.6 million members, came after its international executive board voted “overwhelmingly” in her favor, according to a news release.  The group had backed Mrs. Clinton in 2007, when she first ran for president. But some of its members favor Mrs. Clinton’s chief rival this time, Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who spoke out early against the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that President Obama has championed. The union’s president, Lee Saunders, who led New York City’s largest municipal union, District Council 37, when Mrs. Clinton was a senator from the state, said A.F.S.C.M.E. leaders believed Mrs. Clinton would be the most “effective champion for working families.” Mrs. Clinton has spent the last month making a more aggressive push for the progressive voters in her party who have warmed to Mr. Sanders’s message. The labor group becomes the ninth major union to endorse her.
