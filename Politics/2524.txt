During Wednesday’s Republican presidential debate, Donald J. Trump said that he believes vaccines can cause autism in children. But decades of evidence disputes this notion. There are no credible studies demonstrating any such link. (For example, just read one recent paper published in The Journal of the American Medical Association.) The two physicians in the debate, Ben Carson and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, argued that while science connecting vaccines and autism is lacking, spreading out the childhood vaccination schedule might be advisable. But that’s a position strongly opposed by the medical community â because there is no link between autism and vaccination, spacing vaccines will not reduce the risk of a child developing autism. But because many parents ask for such delayed schedules, doctors often accommodate such demands, putting children at risk of catching diseases before they are vaccinated or potentially failing to complete their recommended vaccines. Failing to vaccinate children has clear health risks. A recent outbreak of measles was aided considerably by unvaccinated people who were able to spread the disease.
