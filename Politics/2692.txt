Donald J. Trump will be “live from New York” next month when the Republican presidential candidate takes another turn hosting “Saturday Night Live.” For the billionaire developer it will be a return to NBC, where he used to star in “The Apprentice.” “S.N.L.” has proved to be a rite of passage for politicians, and Mr. Trump will have the opportunity to meet his new doppelgÃ¤nger, Taram Killam, who has perfected his penchant scowl and gusto. Hillary Rodham Clinton made an appearance on “S.N.L.” this month, showing her comedic side and poking fun at Mr. Trump. The Nov. 7 appearance will not be Mr. Trump’s first time on the show. He last hosted it in 2004, when he showed a similar confidence that he now demonstrates on the campaign trail. âItâs great to be here at ‘Saturday Night Live,’ but, Iâll completely honest, itâs better for ‘Saturday Night Live’ that Iâm here,” Mr. Trump said at the time. “Nobody’s bigger than me. Nobodyâs better than me. Iâm a ratings machine.”  Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
