Donald Trump wants to rock in the free world, but Neil Young is not having it. Mr. Trump, the billionaire businessman, drew Mr. Young’s rebuke on Tuesday when he strode across the stage at Trump Tower to declare his presidential candidacy backed by Mr. Youngâs song âRockinâ in the Free World.â “Donald Trump was not authorized to use âRockin’ in the Free Worldâ in his presidential candidacy announcement,â the musicianâs team said in a statement. âNeil Young, a Canadian citizen, is a supporter of Bernie Sanders for president of the United States of America.” That Mr. Young would insult The Donald for using his rock anthem and endorse someone more liberal could have been foreseen. After all, the song is famously liberal, having been written as an indictment of the poverty policies of the elder President George Bushâs administration. Mr. Trump is a Republican. He is not the first presidential candidate to be admonished for using an artistâs song without permission. In April, Senator Marco Rubio declared his candidacy to the electronic tune âSomething New,â drawing disapproval from the Swedish duo Axwell and Ingrosso. Mitt Romney was a three-time offender during his 2012 presidential campaign, drawing scorn for using K’naan’s “Wavin’ Flag,” the Silversun Pickups’ “Panic Switch,â and Survivor’s “Eye of the Tiger.” Nor is Mr. Trump the first conservative to use music with a mismatched message. Ronald Reagan praised Â Bruce Springsteenâs “message of hope” after The Boss released the album âBorn in the U.S.A.â The title song was written to protest broken government, the vast military-industrial complex and the mistreatment of American war veterans, but it has become a patriotic anthem, and politicians of all stripes continue rocking to it.
