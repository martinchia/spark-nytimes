Updated, 12:15 p.m. | Former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, who is seeking the Republican nomination for president, received some good news regarding his legal problems on Friday when an appeals court in his state dropped one of the two felony charges he is facing. Mr. Perry was indicted last summer on criminal charges of abuse of power and coercion of a public servant. The case surrounds an episode during which Mr. Perry was accused of trying to use his powers as governor to make an elected official step down after being charged with drunken driving. The case has been a nuisance for Mr. Perry as he looks to gain traction in a crowded field of Republicans seeking the party’s presidential nomination. On Friday, the Austin court dismissed the coercion of a public servant charge against Mr. Perry on the grounds that violates his right to free speech under the First Amendment. “Because the First Amendment bars enforcement of the statute on which the âcoercion of a public servantâ charge is based, that charge must be dismissed,” Judge Bert Richardson wrote in an opinion. The coercion charge would have carried a prison sentence of two to 10 years. Mr. Perry still faces the more serious abuse of official capacity charge, which carries a prison sentence of five to 99 years. Critics of Mr. Perry argue that he overstepped his authority following the 2013 arrest of Rosemary Lehmberg, the district attorney in Travis County, who is a Democrat. He threatened to veto $7.5 million in state funding for the public corruption unit in her office unless she resigned. When she would not resign, Mr. Perry followed through, vetoing the money and saying that he could not support âcontinued state funding for an office with statewide jurisdiction at a time when the person charged with ultimate responsibility of that unit has lost the publicâs confidence.â Mr. Perry, the first Texas governor in nearly 100 years to face criminal charges, has denied any wrongdoing and on Friday applauded the ruling. His lawyers have argued that the remaining charge should be considered a misdemeanor and that a veto in the absence of bribery cannot be illegal. “The remaining charge is hanging by a thread, and we are confident that once it is put before the court, it will be dismissed on its face,” said Tony Buzbee, lead counsel for Mr. Perry. Michael McCrum, the special prosecutor who has brought the case against Mr. Perry, was not immediately available to comment on the dismissal of the charge. Mr. Perry chose not to run for another term as governor of Texas, stepping aside in January after a 14 year reign to focus on his second White House bid. Despite the controversy, Mr. Perry’s Republican rivals have been cordial about the case and have not used it against him. This year, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana panned the accusations and defended Mr. Perry’s character.
