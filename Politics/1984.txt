Donald J. Trump and Ben Carson “buried the hatchet” on Friday as Mr. Carson endorsed the Manhattan businessman, proclaiming him the best person to be America’s next president. Mr. Trump said that the tough attacks he once leveled at Mr. Carson were just politics, and Mr. Carson agreed that forgiveness was the way forward. Still, things got quite nasty late last year as Mr. Carson gave Mr. Trump a run for his money in Iowa. Here are some of Mr. Trump’s greatest hits against the mild-mannered brain surgeon who now supports him. Mr. Trump on Mr. Carson’s immigration views: “Ben Carson is very, very weak on immigration. He believes in amnesty strongly.” Mr. Trump on Mr. Carson’s energy levels: “Actually, I think Ben Carson is lower energy than Jeb.” Mr. Trump on Mr. Carson’s ability to stimulate the economy: “Ben Carson has never created a job in his life (well, maybe a nurse). I have created tens of thousands of jobs, it’s what I do.” Mr. Trump on Mr. Carson’s fitness to lead: “Itâs not his thing. He doesnât have the temperament for it. I think Ben just doesnât have the experience.” Mr. Trump on Mr. Carsonâs religion: âI mean, Seventh-day Adventist, I donât know about, I just donât know about.â Mr. Trump on Mr. Carson being violent as a child: âHe actually said ‘pathological temper,’ and then he defined it as disease. If you’re pathological, there’s no cure for that, folks. If you’re a child molester, a sick puppy, there’s no cure for that.â Mr. Trump on Mr. Carson’s bad temper, continued: “Think about what Carson is saying: he hit his mother over the head with a hammer, he hit a friend in the face with a lock, he tried to kill somebody with a knife.” Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
