Hillary Clinton defended her paid speeches to Wall Street firms, rejecting the idea that the millions of dollars she earned in fees would sway her views on financial firms. On the heels of repeated attacks from Senator Bernie Sanders, who has seized on the fees to portray Mrs. Clinton as out of touch with ordinary Iowans and other voters, Mrs. Clinton gave an interview this week in Iowa to The Des Moines Register, saying she had no regrets. âAnybody who thinks they can buy me doesnât know me,” Mrs. Clinton said, in the article published Friday. She described her paid speaking â which spanned events for financial firms and a number of other trade associations and businesses, which typically paid fees of around $225,000 per speech â as a chance for business leaders to hear about her views on world events. “What they were interested in were my views on what was going on in the world,” Mrs. Clinton said. “And whether youâre in health care, or you sell automobiles, or youâre in banking â thereâs a lot of interest in getting advice and views about what you think is happening in the world.” As she did in the Democratic debate on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton compared her speaking fees, most of which went to her personally, as similar to the millions of dollars in campaign contributions accepted by the presidential campaign of Barack Obama. She also attacked Mr. Sanders’s own record on financial regulation, saying the Vermont senator had voted in 2000 to deregulate the trading of credit swaps, which some experts view as a precursor to the 2008 financial crisis. “He’s never owned up to it, he never explained it,” Mrs. Clinton said.
