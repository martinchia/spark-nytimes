A meat cleaver, a blender, a golf club, some lighter fluid and a roof: Senator Lindsey Graham used them all to destroy a cellphone, a day after Donald J. Trump read his number out loud at a campaign rally. âOr, if all else fails,â Mr. Graham says in a video released Wednesday, âyou can always give your number to the Donald.â Both men are seeking the Republican presidential nomination and have been trading insults in recent days after Mr. Trump questioned the heroism of Senator John McCain, a close friend of Mr. Graham’s and a former prisoner of war in North Vietnam. The video, posted by IJReview, is set to Vivaldi’s “The Four Seasons” and features Mr. Graham, dressed in a white button-down shirt and dark slacks, repeatedly damaging a flip phone. The candidate said Tuesday night that his phone had not stopped ringing in the hours after his number was released. On Wednesday, callers trying to reach the the number were greeted by a Verizon message informing them that it had been changed, disconnected or was no longer in service. The video ends with Mr. Graham throwing the phone off screen. âThis is for all the veterans,â he says.
