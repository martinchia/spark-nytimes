Carly Fiorina’s presidential campaign said on Monday that she raised more than $1.4 million since she announced her bid for the White House two months ago. The sum is slim compared with some of her better-known rivals and shows the challenges Ms. Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, faces as she tries to emerge from a crowded field of Republican contenders. Despite the small fundraising tally, Ms. Fiorina’s campaign sought to demonstrate that her candidacy is gaining momentum in other areas such as endorsements and polling. A recent poll found her placing fifth in New Hampshire. “We wonât raise as much as others at this early stage of our campaign, but we will raise what we need to go the distance,” Frank F. Sadler, Ms. Fiorina’s campaign manager, said in a memo to supporters. She also will be relying heavily on the support of her Super PAC to carry her message.  On Monday evening, the super PAC, Carly for America, said it had raised $3.4 million. Candidates closed the books on their second quarter fundraising last week and the tallies will be publicly released next week.  Senator Ted Cruz said on Sunday that he had raised $10.2 million in the second quarter, on top of the $4.3 million he raised at the end of the first quarter. Meanwhile, Hillary Rodham Clinton’s campaign said last week that she has raised $45 million since declaring her candidacy in April.  Mr. Sadler noted that Ms. Fiorina was busy running charities rather than cultivating political infrastructure prior to announcing her run and warned that her grassroots effort should not be underestimated.  The campaign would not say what percentage of its donations came from small donors or how much cash it currently has on hand.
