Gov. Bobby Jindal, looking for traction in the Republican presidential nomination contest, is welcoming Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday to his home state of Louisiana, where she plans to hold an event stressing the positive effects of President Obama’s health care law.  Mr. Jindal issued a statement in advance of the visit, challenging Mrs. Clinton to a debate on the Affordable Care Act. “Secretary Clinton is the godmother of socialized medicine,” Mr. Jindal said in the statement. “The government takeover of our health care system started with HillaryCare in the 1990s.”  Mr. Jindal is among the Republican contenders who favor repealing and replacing the health care law.  Mrs. Clinton is using events in Louisiana, Arkansas and elsewhere to focus attention on the ways in which the health care law has helped families. She is also focusing a plan for containing prescription drug costs.  Hillary Rodham Clinton said that she would refuse to let Republican lawmakers âstart the health care debate all over againâ by repealing the Affordable Care Act.
