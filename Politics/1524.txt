Good Wednesday morning. Before telling a large crowd in Iowa that “the Summer of Trump” had been great for his ego, Donald J. Trump got into a heated exchange with a journalist from a Spanish-language network, adding to a season of early twists and surprises in both parties. And another could be in the works as Mr. Trump might have to soon move over to make room in the spotlight. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Hillary Rodham Clinton and other Democratic presidential contenders are set to address the party’s summer meeting in Minneapolis this week, but Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is getting ahead of the game even if he won’t be on hand. As he ponders a possible presidential candidacy, Mr. Biden has invited hundreds of members of the Democratic National Committee to a conference call Wednesday afternoon as he discusses provisions of the nuclear agreement with Iran. The call is an opportunity for Mr. Biden to emphasize his role in the Obama administration and to show off his foreign policy chops while keeping his name in the presidential conversation with committee members whose personal support and political networks could be crucial to winning the nomination as well as the general election. Two members who received the invitation said they took it as a sign that, at the least, he wants to make sure he is on the committeeâs radar before it hears from the current field. His decision is expected this summer. Supporters of Mr. Biden will also be a force at the Minneapolis meeting, where, according to an email to party members from Draft Biden, a group encouraging Mr. Biden to run, four informal briefings will be held. Joshua Alcorn, senior adviser to Draft Biden, wrote in the email that he âwanted to share with you Draft Biden’s thoughts on the 2016 Democratic Primary,â according to a copy that was shared with The Times. âAll we ask is that you keep an open mind and consider Joe Biden,â Mr. Alcorn wrote. Mr. Biden wasn’t the only one emphasizing his links to the administration. Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, on Tuesday held up her endorsement by Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary. The news release didn’t make much of that job however, instead noting repeatedly that Mr. Vilsack was a former governor of Iowa. â Carl Hulse Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. President Obama will participate in another segment of his “Live From the White House” interviews with anchors from several markets. His aides say he will discuss the nuclear deal with Iran and his planned trip on Thursday to New Orleans to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Martin O’Malley‘s campaign will participate in 30 house parties throughout Iowa, with the candidate calling in to each. A nationwide house party by Mr. Sanders last month drew over 100,000 attendees. Jeb Bush will hold a town hall in Pensacola, Fla., and his campaign will be opening its Nevada office in Las Vegas. Mr. Trump has put in place a robust field operation in Iowa, but converting raucous crowds into votes remains a challenge. An email exchange gives insight into Mr. Bushâs thinking about same-sex marriage during his time as governor of Florida. And by refusing support from âsuper PACs,â Mr. Sanders has built a campaign that appears to be drawing even more rank-and-file support than Mr. Obama did in 2008. Many Spanish-language news outlets no longer pretend to objectively cover Mr. Trump after his disparaging remarks about Mexican immigrants. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey held a news conference urging Senator Cory Booker to oppose the Iran nuclear deal. With a financial crisis in China rattling global markets, and drawing the attention of other Republican candidates, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida plans to deliver a major foreign policy speech outlining how a Rubio administration would more assertively challenge the Chinese. And in his arguments with Mr. Trump over immigration, Mr. Bush offered some clear distinctions while also angering Asian-Americans as he sought to soothe feelings among Hispanics for his previous use of the term âanchor baby.â Mr. Trump is huge in the Spanish-language news media â but not always in a good way. First Draft asked two nonpartisan media analytics companies â Crimson Hexagon and Two.42.Solutions â to crunch the numbers on how Mr. Trump is covered in the Spanish-language news media in comparison with the English-language news media. And some trends emerged. Looking at online news, forums and blogs, Crimson Hexagon found that coverage of Mr. Trump more frequently was tied to immigration in the Spanish news media (56.5 percent of the time) than in the English news media (18.46 percent). The company also found that he was covered more negatively in the Spanish-language news media (69 percent negative mentions) than in the English-language news media (58 percent). âThe conversation was more negative than positive in general, particularly in blogs and forums, in both languages,â said Chris Bingham, the chief technology officer of Crimson Hexagon. Two.42.Solutions, which also found that Mr. Trump was covered more critically in the Spanish-language media, noticed another interesting trend in both English and Spanish news media: âRight now, the more bad things you say about Trump, the more likely your article is to go viral,â said Mohammad Hamid, a co-founder and chief technology officer of Two.42.Solutions. â Ashley Parker Referring to Black Lives Matter protesters who have interrupted candidates at several appearances, The Los Angeles Times says, “This election has put White House hopefuls in the unusual position of defending themselves even to apparent allies.” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is courting evangelicals, but, The Washington Post writes, “there isn’t really an evangelical vote right now.” If Mr. Trump hopes to be on the ballot in South Carolina, The Associated Press reports, he must rule out a third-party run by Sept. 30. Former President George W. Bush is stepping up to the plate on his brother Jeb‘s behalf, and will appear at a New York fund-raiser for him, The Washington Post reports. Caroline Kennedy, the United States ambassador to Japan, was found to have used personal email for official State Department business, The Associated Press reports. Mr. Biden has finally decided to run for president again â three times in the last three days, if you believe paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission since Sunday. The three documents, known as “statements of candidacy,” are among a rash of bogus presidential announcements that have flooded the F.E.C. this year, along with hundreds of real announcements by long-shot candidates. Among the supposed candidates: Doge Wow (named for an Internet meme); one Mr. Pants, first name Cranky; and Bippy the Clown. There is no filing fee, so many people send in the form. There are 1,736 statements of candidacy on record for the 2016 campaign cycle, including actual declared candidates like Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bush. Mr. Biden is not yet among them, a spokeswoman said. Clues abound however: One of the forms spells his middle name wrong, and includes a racy name for his supposed campaign committee. â Nicholas Confessore Like the Politics Newsletter?
