The United States womenâs soccer team will have some high-profile fans in the stands on Sunday as it faces Japan in the World Cup final. The White House on Thursday named a delegation to the championship game in Vancouver, B.C. Jill Biden, accompanied by her husband, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., will lead the group. “The team is a source of pride and unity, and we can’t wait to see them represent the United States on the world stage,” the Bidens said in a statement. “Let’s cheer the team on and bring the World Cup trophy home.” The delegation includes Bruce Heyman, United States ambassador to Canada; Evan Ryan, assistant secretary at the State Department who oversees international cultural exchange programs; Cobi Jones, a three-time United States men’s World Cup player; and Mia Hamm, a former United States womenâs national team player. Ms. Hamm, whose career included two World Cup titles and two Olympic gold medals, retired from professional soccer in 2004. She was a part of the last United States team to win the World Cup, in 1999, when the Americans beat China in a dramatic shootout.
