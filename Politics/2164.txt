Good Monday morning from Washington. Though trade is still a source of gamesmanship and huge Supreme Court decisions could come down at any moment, all eyes are on Charleston, S.C., where crowds on Sunday spilled out of the church in which nine black churchgoers were killed on Wednesday by a white gunman. If it were up to most of the Republican presidential candidates, the campaign would be centered on what they perceive as President Obama’s shortcomings, the threat of Islamic terrorism and questions about Hillary Rodham Clinton’s ethics. But instead, the next few weeks are likely to be dominated by a host of issues that will test their ability to balance the competing demands of conservative primary voters and the general electorate. First, there was Pope Francis’ encyclical on the threat of climate change, which thrust into the campaign a topic that many Republicans have sought to dodge. Then came last week’s massacre of nine people at a black church in Charleston, S.C., which has prompted difficult questions about gun violence, racial discrimination and the displaying of the Confederate flag. But if that was not enough to put them on the defensive, now comes the Supreme Court, which is expected to rule in the next two weeks on two cases likely to create a new round of difficult questions for the Republicans. There is the matter of how to replace the health insurance of millions of Americans who could lose their coverage if the court strikes down the part of Affordable Care Act that provides subsidies to individuals in states that rely on the federal insurance marketplace. And there is the prospect that the court could effectively legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, prompting the question of whether (and how) the Republican candidates would fight such a decision. In sports, this is called playing an away game. These issues do not make up the terrain on which Republicans wish to contest this election. â Jonathan Martin Stay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates. This is the week that Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana is expected to add his name to the long list of Republican presidential candidates. The candidates who are senators â Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky, all Republicans, and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democrat, will be tied up in Washington for much of the week. Mrs. Clinton will be in Virginia on Friday, while also late in the week, Mr. Cruz, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, and Donald J. Trump will be in Iowa, as will Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, a Republican, who will make his first visit to the state, despite not quite being a candidate yet, to in part gauge its interest in him. Amid tensions between the United States and China over the cybertheft of personal information from 14 million federal workers, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and Secretary of State John Kerry will host the seventh United States-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, through Wednesday. Trade is back in the Senate’s court as advocates and the White House push this week to finish the difficult fight before lawmakers head out of town for a Fourth of July recess. After the House passed legislation last week giving Mr. Obama fast-track negotiating authority, Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who is the majority leader, set up a series of votes that he hopes will end with the president signing both the fast-track bill and a second measure granting training and other benefits to workers displaced by overseas competition. As always in the contentious trade maneuvering, there are some wrinkles. Mr. McConnell needs Democrats who initially supported the trade deal in the Senate last month to back it again. But in the previous go-round, the negotiating power and the worker aid were tied together, making it easier for Democrats. Now, they will be considered separately, and some Democrats are saying they arenât sure they can back a deal structured that way. That position gives Democrats added leverage to extract more concessions from Republicans on the worker assistance, but Republicans seem to think they have already been generous and may balk at further sweetening the package. The critical vote on the arrangement could come as early as Tuesday. Even with all the jockeying, pro-trade forces believe they are on their way to success despite another push by labor to block the legislation. But Mr. McConnell acknowledged that a trade victory was going to require a little trust on the part of Republicans and Democrats, a commodity in short supply on Capitol Hill. â Carl Hulse  The Supreme Court enters the termâs homestretch on Monday, with 11 decisions yet to come. The blockbusters on same-sex marriage and health care are not likely to be among those announced when the justices take the bench at 10 a.m. More likely are ones on lethal injections, housing discrimination and whether the Constitution allows independent commissions rather than state legislatures to draw voting districts. There is only one more day scheduled for the court to issue decisions: Monday, June 29. But the court is likely to add one or two more days this week, and there is a possibility that the term will end on Tuesday, June 30. One potential calendar: health care next Monday and same-sex marriage the day after. â Adam Liptak The Coalition for Public Safety, the strange-bedfellows alliance of progressives and conservatives over criminal justice overhaul, is set on Monday to issue policy recommendations aimed at reducing the national prison population and making it easier for those released from prison to start over. The proposals are expected to include reducing mandatory minimum penalties, allowing judges more discretion in sentencing, expanding alternatives to incarceration, reducing education and employment barriers to former offenders, increasing federal hiring, improving accuracy of criminal background checks, and allowing low-level offenders to erase criminal records after a period of good conduct. The coalition has muscle from conservatives and liberals, who have found common ground on the idea that America’s criminal justice system has become too reliant on incarceration, even for nonviolent offenders. Groups represented in Mondayâs announcement include the conservative Americans for Tax Reform and the progressive American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for American Progress. â Carl Hulse Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the onetime altar boy from Sacramento and conservative Republican, has advanced legal equality for gays more than any other American jurist. Mr. Obama played golf over the weekend on emerald courses in California, bringing himself into the state’s debate over its severe drought and water-use restrictions. And for Father’s Day, some of the 2016 presidential candidates and hopefuls have been telling the tales of their fathers. The Washington Post takes a look at the state flags bearing symbols of the Confederacy, and notes that, according to census data, “roughly one-third of the nation’s black population lives under a state flag that evokes” such images. And writing about the man accused of the Charleston shooting, The Guardian reports, “The leader of a right-wing group that Dylann Roof allegedly credits with helping to radicalise him against black people before the Charleston church massacre has donated tens of thousands of dollars to Republicans such as presidential candidates Ted Cruz, Rand Paul and Rick Santorum.” Mrs. Clinton may have gotten a lot of buzz for basing her campaign in Brooklyn, but she continues to do most of her New York-based work at her Manhattan offices, and her team just signed a new lease there, Politico reports. The Washington Post’s fact checker calls out Mr. Paul for vastly overstating things in citing a man who was imprisoned for 10 years for putting dirt on his property. “Meet the Press” was criticized by some on Sunday for showing a video segment of black prisoners talking about their gun crimes on the same episode that discussed the Charleston shooting. The segment, which the host Chuck Todd said was decided upon before the shootings, was called insensitive, at best, by some critics. The Hill reports. Like the Politics Newsletter?
