LAS VEGAS â Jeb Bush took a break from talking about the principles of economic freedom at a Libre Institute forum here to weigh in on his favorite superhero. In response to a rather specific question from the audience (âWho is your favorite superhero â Marvel, they have in parenthesis â and why?â the moderator asked, reading from an audience notecard), Mr. Bush offered a lighthearted, if slightly circuitous, response. His first answer, appropriately, incorporated the themes of economic prosperity on which Libre, founded by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, is focused: âI like watching the movies, and I wish I owned Marvel, as somebody who believes in capitalism,â Mr. Bush said, to laughter. Then he settled on a superhero. âIâm kind of old school,â he said. âI kind of like the old-school guys, like Batman.â (It should be noted that Batman, while a wonderful savior of Gotham, is actually a DC Comics hero.) And finally, Mr. Bush named another superhero he likes for an entirely different reason. â âSupergirlâ is on TV â I saw that when I was working out this morning,â he said. âShe looked pretty hot. I donât know what channel itâs on, but Iâm looking forward to that.â And, he added with another laugh, âthat will make news.â
