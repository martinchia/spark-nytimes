ORLANDO, Fla. â Senator Marco Rubio had one message Tuesday for attendees at the Economic Growth Summit at Disney World: This is âa new American centuryâ (his campaign motto) and he is the fresh new face who can lead the country there. Rather than playing up his Florida state ties, or his personal background, Mr. Rubio stuck to the bold letters that appear on his campaign signs, working in some version of the sentiment ânewâ into nearly every sentence. It is a theme that not only calls to mind his relative youth, but also subtly contrasts himself with candidates whose family names â Clinton and Bush â have been so dominant in Washington politics for decades. âWhile our economy has transformed, our policies and our leaders are not,â Mr. Rubio said, appearing via video before a bright white background (he remained in Washington for a last-minute Senate vote on surveillance). âOur outdated leaders continue to cling to outdated ideas.â Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, is expected to speak Tuesday afternoon at the conference, which is taking place in the heart of the battleground state that they will both likely be pulling out all stops to win. Mr. Rubio embraced ânew 21st-century jobs,â perhaps a reference to the spreading tech sector and other industries providing higher-paying jobs. He made the remarks after coming off a campaign swing in Nevada last week, where he held a âtech round tableâ in Las Vegas.   Mr. Rubio continued to paint himself as a member of the new generation able to understand and handle this transition. He criticized the nation’s current leaders, saying, âEven though technology is transforming every industry, they intend to bring back old jobs rather than spur the creation of new ones,â and promised to âreform government to spur private sector innovation, so that we quicken our economies transition to the better paying jobs of this new century.â Follow the New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter.
