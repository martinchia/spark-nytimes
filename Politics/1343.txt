The Republican National Committee has canceled its partnership with NBC for a late February debate in Houston and is awarding the broadcast to CNN. The decision comes after many Republicans, including Reince Priebus, the committee chairman, were dissatisfied with CNBCâs handling of the third Republican debate in October. âThe Republican National Committee has decided to move forward without NBCâs participation in the February debate in Houston,â Mr. Priebus said in a statement, adding that the date of the event would be moved up a day, to Feb. 25 from Feb. 26, and that âthe partnership with Telemundo and conservative partners National Review and Salem Communications will continue as planned.â The Houston debate will come a few days before 12 states head to the polls or caucuses for Super Tuesday on March 1. Shortly after the October debate, Mr. Priebus sent a letter to NBC officials suspending the partnership, which put the Houston debate partnership in jeopardy. Mr. Priebus wrote then that CNBCâs âhandling of the debate was conducted in bad faith,â saying that âquestions were inaccurate or downright offensive.â NBC officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday.
