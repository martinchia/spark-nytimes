Among the many issues dividing the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, few are as clear-cut as the minimum wage. While the Democrats support raising it, the Republican field has been overwhelmingly opposed, citing concerns about possible job losses. Ben Carson was an exception to that rule. But he is no longer. Mr. Carson said at the debate on Tuesday that he would not raise the minimum wage â a notable shift in position compared with views he expressed earlier in the campaign (and even at an earlier debate). Asked about the minimum wage in a CNBC interview in May, he said that âprobably it should be higher.â At a rally in Arizona in August, Mr. Carson gave largely the same view, saying of the minimum wage, âIt probably does need to be adjusted.â â¨On wages, Mr. Carson put forward some ideas: He would index the minimum wage, so it would automatically rise in the future. He also suggested having two minimum wages: an entry-level wage and a âsustainingâ wage. He mentioned those ideas at the CNN debate in September. But by Tuesdayâs debate, Mr. Carson had fallen in line with the Republican orthodoxy on the subject. He asserted that raising the minimum wage increased joblessness, a claim about which economists disagree. Asked point-blank if he would raise the minimum wage, he responded, âI would not raise it.â Find out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter.
