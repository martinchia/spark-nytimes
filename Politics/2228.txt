Itâs the #IranDeal for Dummies, brought to you by the White House. As President Obama makes his increasingly urgent case to the public and a skeptical Congress on behalf of the nuclear accord with Iran, his team rolled out a series of digital tools on Tuesday to build support for it. The White House started a Twitter account, @TheIranDeal, designed to âset the record straightâ about the agreement. And officials added a page to the White House website that lays out in user-friendly â and often extraordinarily simplistic â terms the contours of the more than 100-page, highly technical deal. Take, for instance, the inspection regime designed to ensure that Iran is not able to develop a nuclear weapon, which would in some cases allow a delay of up to 24 days before international inspectors would be able to gain access to sites where they suspect the Iranians are secretly trying to develop a bomb. It falls short of the âanytime, anywhereâ inspections standard that critics have demanded, arguing that the delay will essentially allow Iran to flout the restrictions without detection. ââAnytime, anywhereâ inspections sound good,â the website says, teeing up the criticism for debunking. âWhy doesnât this deal require those?â The answer: The agreement ensures access for the International Atomic Energy Agency âwhen needed, where needed.â   ââAnytime, anywhereâ inspections are simply unnecessary thanks to the deal,â it declares. Also included are a series of graphics that aim to boil down the deal’s essential features, including one that argues it would cut off all of Iranâs pathways for developing a nuclear weapon. âBLOCKED,â it blares in red letters. Of course, Mr. Obama is not the only one using social media to make his case on the agreement. Just as the White House began its Twitter account, a lookalike handle, @TheIranBomb, popped up. âSay #No to propaganda,â it tweeted on Tuesday.
