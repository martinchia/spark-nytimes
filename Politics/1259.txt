The Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee spoke to crowds in Kentucky about Kim Davis, the clerk who was jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Mike Huckabee captured the political spotlight on Tuesday, rallying to the side of Kim Davis, the Kentucky clerk who went to jail for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, and casting her fight as a choice between tyranny and religious freedom.  Mr. Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, was joined by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas in calling for Ms. Davis to be freed from the Carter County Detention Center, where she was held over the weekend for refusing to certify marriages. But it was Mr. Huckabee, a former Baptist pastor, who took the stage with Ms. Davis after she was freed and cast her battle as his own. “If you have to put someone in jail, let me go,” Mr. Huckabee said to a cheering crowd.  Mr. Huckabee is making his second presidential bid and while he has performed well in Iowa in the past, he is failing to galvanize significant support from social conservatives so far this year in such a crowded field.  He said that Ms. Davis’s plight was not an issue of politics, as she is a registered Democrat, but one of religious liberty and constitutional rights. “The founders never gave one branch of government the power to make the law,” Mr. Huckabee said, referring to the Supreme Court’s decision in June allowing same-sex marriage across the country. “Every one of us will have to decide whether we want to keep this great country or whether we want to surrender and sacrifice it to tyranny.” Ms. Davis gave a brief statement thanking her supporters for helping her through the ordeal, saying “we serve the living God who knows where each and every one of us is at.” Meanwhile, Mr. Cruz stood off to the side, keeping an unusually low profile during the event.
