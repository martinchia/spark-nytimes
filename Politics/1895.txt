As the Republicans prepared to take the stage in Simi Valley, Calif., for their second presidential debate, Hillary Rodham Clinton took the stage in New York to tape the “Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon.” Mrs. Clinton took a phone call from Donald J. Trump, as portrayed by Mr. Fallon wearing a blonde wig and an aggressive orange tan. âIâve spent my entire career fighting for womenâs rights,â Mrs. Clinton explained. âIâm really curious, Donald, what is your stance on womenâs issues?â âLook, I know a lot of women…and they all have issues,â Mr. Fallon’s Trump replied.  He also gave Mrs. Clinton, whose poll numbers have taken a hit lately, some candid campaign advice. âYou sound like a robot,â he said, raising his feigned New York accent. âYou want to win, hereâs what you have to do, yell!â Mrs. Clinton, wearing a hot pink tunic, nodded as if to write Mr. Trumpâs advice down and instead grabbed a goblet of white wine and took a swig. The interview is part of a September blitz of national television appearances by Mrs. Clinton. Last week, she sat down with NBC News, ABC News and chatted with a 5-year-old presidential historian on the âEllen DeGeneres Show.â On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton planned to take a break from campaigning in New Hampshire to speak to CNNâs Wolf Blitzer. Sheâll share her reactions to the Republican debate. (Hint: She’ll say they’re all out of touch and bad for the country.) In an interview with Mr. Fallon, who had shed his Trump costume after the opening, Mrs. Clinton thanked the house band, The Roots. âIâve got to thank Roots,â she said. âI love Roots.â Mr. Fallon brought up Mr. Trump a lot in the interview, including asking why Mrs. Clinton relies so heavily on a teleprompter rather than speaking off the cuff.  âI learned that by watching how successful President Obama wasâ using a teleprompter, she said. âI could go more stream of consciousness, you know, this is a huge election,â Mrs. Clinton said using Mr. Trumpâs favorite adjective. The late-night host had an easy rapport with Mrs. Clinton with none of the tension apparent in her news interviews. Mr. Fallon praised Mrs. Clintonâs toughness, comparing her to a popular UFC fighter, âif Ronda Rousey shopped at Ann Taylor.â At one point, Mr. Fallon sheepishly asked, âCan I just talk about the email scandal?â âSure!â Mrs. Clinton exclaimed and described how most of her private emails at the State Department were dullsville. She told Mr. Fallon about posing for a selfie with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West at a fund-raiser in Los Angeles last month. âThey were just delightful,â Mrs. Clinton said. âSheâs a pro at this selfie deal.â
