DES MOINES â At the height of Gov. Chris Christieâs national celebrity four years ago, a group of Iowa business leaders flew a private plane to New Jersey to appeal to him to enter the 2012 presidential race.    Mr. Christie took a pass, but this year as his campaign floundered, he repeatedly made overtures to the group of rich and influential figures. On Tuesday, Mr. Christie accepted the endorsement of the group, led by an agribusiness mogul and political king-maker in Iowa, Bruce Rastetter. The governor brushed off the reversal of roles in the political courtship. âI donât really care who chases who as long as we wind up being married,ââ Mr. Christie said.  âAnd todayâs the ceremony.ââ Mr. Rastetter, one of Iowaâs biggest Republican donors, said Mr. Christieâs record of governing with a Democratic Legislature meant he could break through Washington dysfunction better than Republicans who just want to âburn the place down.ââ The fact that Mr. Rastetter threw his money and influence behind Mr. Christie, despite the governor’s low polling and appeals from other Republicans, can be seen as a slight to those candidates in the partyâs business-oriented wing, including Jeb Bush, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. An uncommitted Republican insider who attended the endorsement announcement on Monday pointed to two white-haired men in the small crowd and said, âThey should be with Jeb Bush.ââ One of the men, John W. Tone, a central committee member of the Republican Party of Polk County, said he was still making up his mind, but he liked Mr. Christie because of âthe way he is direct in his answers and doesnât come across as floweryâ on policy issues.  Mr. Christie recounted with relish the moment in the recent Republican debate when he scolded Donald J. Trump and Carly Fiorina for arguing about their business records because âthe 55-year-old construction worker sitting at homeâ doesnât care.   Mr. Trump, Mrs. Fiorina and a third nonpolitician, Ben Carson, lead in polls of Iowa Republicans, with Mr. Christie drawing only 1 percent of support. Asked if he would receive donations from Mr. Rastetter and the five other business figures who endorsed him on Tuesday, Mr. Chrisite said, âTheyâre a part of our team now.ââ Earlier on Tuesday, he met with Gov. Terry Branstad, who has credited Mr. Rastetter with luring him out of retirement to run for governor. The Christie campaign in the state is made up of several former Branstad operatives. The Christie-Iowa connection has always seemed like an odd-couple marriage, but both sides have encouraged it.  Critics in New Jersey last year accused the governor of pandering to Iowans when he vetoed a bill banning restrictive cages for pregnant hogs. Animal rights protesters interrupted Mr. Christie at the Iowa State Fair in August. (âFeels like Iâm back in Trenton for a couple of minutes, so thank you, Iowa,ââ Mr. Christie said.) The governor met privately during the state fair with Mr. Rastetter, who made his fortune in hogs and ethanol.  On Tuesday Mr. Rastetter laughed off a reporterâs question about whether he hoped to serve as agriculture secretary in a Christie administration.   âWeâre going to reinvigorate the debate thatâs going on in Iowa right now in a way I think is going to be very pleasing to the caucusgoers,ââ Mr. Christie said.
