A passing comment by the president of Columbia University on Monday touched off a flurry of expectations that President Obama would affiliate with the university, his alma mater, after he leaves office, but the White House said no decisions had been made. Lee C. Bollinger, the Columbia president, mentioned at convocation that he looked forward to welcoming back the university’s most famous alumnus, a remark that was quickly repeated on social media. Mr. Obama earned a bachelor’s degree from Columbia in 1983. “The president has long talked about his respect for Columbia University and his desire to continue working with them,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters during Mr. Obama’s trip to Alaska in response to Mr. Bollinger’s comments. “However, at this point no decisions have been finalized about his post-presidency plans.” Columbia said in a statement that Mr. Bollinger’s comment “only reiterated the May 12 statement by the Barack Obama Foundation that it ‘intends to maintain a presence at Columbia University for the purpose of exploring and developing opportunities for a long-term association’ and reflected no further developments concerning President Obamaâs plans.”
