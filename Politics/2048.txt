Aides to Hillary Clinton have expressed a range of emotions since it was revealed Friday that members of Senator Bernie Sandersâs campaign had obtained access to a database of information about her supporters. They were outraged: âImagine if Toyota got the list of Ford, of their consumers who are most loyal. Itâs outrageous,â said Joel Benenson, Mrs. Clintonâs chief strategist. They were indignant: âNo one in our campaign has ever accessed anyone elseâs data. I can say that definitively,â said Robby Mook, the campaign manager. By Saturday nightâs debate, Mrs. Clinton herself was forgiving: âI very much appreciate that comment, Bernie,â she said after Mr. Sanders apologized for the data breach. âIt really is important that we go forward on this.â But another sentiment, a mixture of resentment and hard-won experience, comes through in conversations about the episode with Mrs. Clintonâs closest advisers: She would have been treated far more harshly, they believe, had her own aides committed such a transgression. âCan you imagine?â said Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clintonâs communications director. âCan you imagine? Oh, my God.â âWeâd be drummed out of the race,â Ms. Palmieri added. The Sanders campaign fired one worker and suspended two others over the data breach, which was made possible by a flaw in the system that the Democratic National Committee uses to store such information. But so far there have been few calls for the ouster of more senior campaign officials â something that Clinton aides have noticed. âIf this had been something the Clinton camp had done, there would have been a very different reaction,â Jim Margolis, Mrs. Clintonâs ad maker, told Politico. They may have a point. Mrs. Clintonâs opponents on the right â and some on the left â would almost certainly have used such a breach as fresh evidence of the dishonesty and underhanded scheming that their detractors have long associated with the Clintons. âShe lies about emails, she lies about Whitewater, she lies about everything,â Donald J. Trump told NBC on Monday, in response to Mrs. Clintonâs assertion in the debate Saturday that Mr. Trump was aiding recruitment by the Islamic State. It is a difficult perception to shake: Despite her being the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, polls show a majority of Americans say they do not trust Mrs. Clinton. Then again, her critics can discern impure motives in just about anything Mrs. Clinton says or does. Her lighthearted âMay the force be with youâ line at the end of the debate prompted some critics to link it to the fact that the director of the new âStar Warsâ movie, J.J. Abrams, and his wife had donated $1 million to Priorities USA, a group supporting Mrs. Clintonâs campaign.
