Good Monday morning from Washington, where the Senate is considering defunding Planned Parenthood and where President Obama will articulate a new climate change plan that is sure to spur discussion on the campaign trail. This week, the trail leads past one of its first significant markers, the initial Republican debate. But first … How do you get to the Fox News debate? Practice, practice, practice. The first widely broadcast Republican presidential debate will be hosted in Cleveland on Thursday evening, by Fox News and Facebook. But on Monday night, 14 members of the sprawling Republican field will get a practice run at a forum hosted by C-Span and three early-state news outlets. The “Voters First Forum,” to be held at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire, is a response by the first three states â New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina â to the Fox News debate, which is restricted to the candidates averaging in the top 10 slots in the polls. In reality, having more than 10 people on the stage was an unwieldy prospect for many cable networks hosting debates. Still, early states worry about their clout diminishing. Only three of the 17 candidates won’t be at the dry run, according to The New Hampshire Union Leader: Donald J. Trump, who declined the invitation, Mike Huckabee and Jim Gilmore. Jeb Bush, who has not run for office since 2002, is among those who could best benefit from a Trump-free environment, giving him a chance to find his footing. But the absence of Mr. Trump also means that the candidates won’t get to road-test their approaches to him on stage.

The deadline to qualify for the Fox News debate is Tuesday, and the next polls to be released will determine who will make the top 10. Governors and former governors are on the bubble for those spots, including Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, and former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. Before the New Hampshire forum, Mr. Perry and Mr. Christie will fit in an appearance in the state, which has been the focus of many determining polls. On Tuesday, Mr. Bush will appear at the Southern Baptist Convention in Nashville, where he will be interviewed by a convention leader. And on Thursday, after 16 years, four and a half presidential elections, and countless interviews conducted and mockeries made of elected officials, Jon Stewart, who has twice met privately at the White House with Mr. Obama, will host his final “Daily Show.” At 2 p.m. Monday, Mr. Obama is set to unveil a set of Environmental Protection Agency regulations on coal-fired power plants, the chief source of the greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say are the driving cause of global warming. If they stand up to an expected tsunami of legal challenges â a big if â the rules will hold as the strongest action ever taken by the United States on climate change. They could also stand as the death knell for the nationâs coal industry. Mr. Obamaâs announcement was initially scheduled for the South Lawn â a stately setting that would have allowed for a large audience and history-ready photo opportunities featuring the president flanked by environmental allies in front of the White House. But with forecasters predicting a scorching-hot day (typical, it must be noted, for Washington in August), the ceremony is now likely to be moved inside. About 250 miles away, the most formidable opponents of the rules will be gathered in a similarly scenic setting, in the heart of coal country, planning their retaliation. The rules require each state to submit a custom climate change plan. That wonât sit well with Republican administrations, or with coal country. As it happens, every Republican attorney general in the land is expected to be in attendance at the groupâs annual conference on Monday â to be held at the lavish Greenbrier resort in West Virginia â the heart of coal country. The attorneys general are expected to band together in a lawsuit against the rules, expected to go before the Supreme Court, and likely to be led by West Virginia. So the group is planning a news event to rebut the rules â but it will have to be broadcast by satellite, since reporters are barred from covering the conference. — Coral Davenport   Mr. Bushâs supporters see Mr. Trump’s surge in the polls as a blessing, believing that he is drawing support from voters who are unlikely to support Mr. Bush but are essential to Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin. Reports that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was seriously exploring entering the 2016 race has reignited discussion among Hillary Rodham Clintonâs advisers about what his potential candidacy would mean for the contest ahead. Martin OâMalley, the former Maryland governor, gave a sweeping speech calling for an overhaul of the criminal justice system, seeking to regain whatever standing he may have lost after âBlack Lives Matterâ protesters interrupted him at the Netroots Nation conference in Nevada a few weeks ago. The billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch hosted a conference in California, and Mr. Trump questioned whether the five presidential candidates in attendance were âpuppets.â Mrs. Clinton‘s campaign is to start airing ads in Iowa and New Hampshire to counter a slew of Republican attack ads. The Senate vote on Monday on a measure that would remove all federal funding for Planned Parenthood is being largely anchored by two freshman Republicans, who have until now been among the groupâs quietest members. Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma, who was elected to the House in 2010 and to the Senate in 2014 to finish the remaining two years of Senator Tom Coburn‘s term, is a former Baptist youth camp director. A speech by the quiet and reserved Mr. Lankford two weeks ago on the Senate floor after videos of Planned Parenthood workers selling fetal tissue for medical research were revealed was notable for its emotions. Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa won her seat in 2014, and has also cut a quiet path in the Senate, largely keeping her opinions to herself as she settles into life in Washington. But the Republican leaders have been eager for a fresh female face to put before reporters and the public, especially around womenâs issues. While the bill, which is also sponsored by Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, is expected to fail to get the 60 votes needed to pass, the way Ms. Ernst fights for her work will no doubt draw the interest of her colleagues. A few Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins of Maine, are expected to give the measure a thumbâs down, as is Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania and generally a reliable antiabortion vote, because of their concerns that it will end womenâs access to services beyond abortion, which is the majority of Planned Parenthoodâs work. The bill would redirect Planned Parenthoodâs taxpayer funding to other womenâs health care service providers, such as community clinics. — Jennifer Steinhauer The Boston Globe profiles Kriss Blevens, a New Hampshire makeup artist who has worked on candidates during five election seasons and who will make sure the candidates are camera-ready for Monday night’s presidential forum. The prospects of Mr. Biden‘s entering the race highlight “two indisputable and seemingly contradictory truths” about Mrs. Clinton, The Washington Post writes: She “has major image problems with the general electorate,” and “she is going to be very, very hard to beat in a Democratic primary.” And a “Face the Nation” panel on CBS debated the art of apology on the campaign trail and how it feeds “the fight for authenticity.” Senator Ted Cruz of Texas may be lagging in the polls, but he told the Koch brothers’ conference that he had a strategy to win the Republican nomination, and it goes through the South, The Washington Post reports.
