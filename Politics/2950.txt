Presidential candidates flocked to Washington to express their solidarity with Israel at the Republican Jewish Coalition presidential forum on Thursday, and their remarks did not go unnoticed on the other side of the world. Relations between the United States and Israel have been rocky during the Obama administration and people in the Jewish state are keeping close tabs on the 2016 presidential race. However, Israelis woke up on Friday morning to some surprising headlines, thanks to this yearâs crop of unconventional candidates. The Times of Israel led with Donald J. Trump’s referring to Jewish people as “good negotiators” and with his declining to commit to supporting Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the country. âTrump courts Republican Jews with offensive stereotypes,â the headline blared atop a story that described his remarks as âanti-Semitic.â The Jerusalem Post gave a broader view of the gathering, detailing how Republicans sought to characterize President Obama and Democrats as a threat to Israel and reporting on Mr. Trumpâs planned visit to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this month. Mr. Trump, whose daughter converted to Judaism, also got significant coverage in Haaretz, which featured his prediction that Jews might not vote for him because he would not accept their donations. Mr. Trump is mostly funding his campaign himself and says he cannot be bought.  âYouâre not going to support me because I donât want your money,â Mr. Trump said. âIsnât it crazy?â The newspaper also highlighted remarks made by Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who has struggled to grasp foreign policy. He seemed to confuse an enemy of Israel with one of the country’s favorite dishes. âBen Carson repeatedly pronounced Hamas, the militant Palestinian political movement that rules the Gaza Strip, as hummus, the Middle Eastern food dip made from chickpeas,â Haaretz reported.
