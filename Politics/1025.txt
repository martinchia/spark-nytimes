PORTSMOUTH, N.H. — Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio had a few minutes Thursday between the end of his remarks to the Portsmith Rotary Club at the country club here and when his lunch arrived. So, taking advantage of a gorgeous fall day, he walked to the driving range and took four swings. He was quite pleased with his shots, exclaiming to his staff after every swing how true he had hit the ball.
