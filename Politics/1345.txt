 TIGERVILLE, S.C. â Senator Ted Cruz of Texas stood onstage here with a mischievous smile, setting off on a stump speech he is typically loath to change. On this occasion, he could not help himself. âNow Iâm curious,â Mr. Cruz told a nearly full auditorium at North Greenville University. âDo the people of South Carolina know what New York values are?â The crowd roared. Laughing off a swelling group of enemies 700 miles away â the New York residents and elected officials who chafed at his ominous dig that one of his rivals, Donald J. Trump, embodied âNew York valuesâ â Mr. Cruz appeared eager on Friday to spread the message. He issued a faux apology in remarks to reporters. And on Sean Hannityâs radio show. And in a news release and a post on Twitter. Iâm happy to apologize to millions of New Yorkers… #NewYorkValues

Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City all demanded I apologize,â he said theatrically, eliciting some grumbles. âWho am I to say no?â He went on: âI apologize to the millions of New Yorkers whoâve been abandoned for years by liberal politicians.â And on: âI apologize to all the hardworking men and women in New York whoâd like to have jobs, but Gov. Cuomo has banned fracking.â And on: âI apologize to all the New Yorkers who are pro-life and pro-marriage and pro-Second Amendment.â And on: âI apologize to all the small businesses that are fleeing New York City because of the crushing taxes and regulations.â And so it went, with Mr. Cruz displaying an impressive handle on New York politics. (He also referenced Mr. de Blasioâs past clashes with his own Police Department and proponents of charter schools.) Wrapping up, Mr. Cruz said he hoped âthat was the apology they were looking for.â The attendees, at least, seemed pleased. âHe basically apologized to the rest of New York,â said Jim Clinton, 55, from Greer, S.C. âYou know what Iâm saying?â
