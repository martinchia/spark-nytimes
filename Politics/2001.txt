Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, Scott Walker and the Obama administrationâs negotiations with Iran for a nuclear containment deal dominated the Sunday news shows. Mr. Trump, the real-estate developer and reality-television star, wasnât a guest on any of the shows, but he was a major focus of conversation a day after he held a rally in Arizona and discussed border security and immigration. At the rally, Mr. Trump, who is running for president as a Republican after years of flirting with a campaign,  invoked a phrase that was popular in the Nixon administration – âsilent majorityâ -to describe who he is speaking for in his caustic comments and hard-line views on immigration. But on CNNâs âState of the Union,â Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, another Republican presidential candidate, sharply attacked Mr. Trump and his message and called on his partyâs chairman and other candidates to speak out against him. Mr. Trump is a âwrecking ballâ for the GOP as it tries to appeal to Hispanic voters, Mr. Graham said. âTo all the candidates who think that Donald Trump is telling the truth, I think you have lost your way.  As to the Republican Party, if we do not reject this way of thinking clearly, without any ambiguity, we will have lost our way,â he said. âWe will have lost the moral authority, in my view, to govern this great nation.â Mr. Graham, who favors a comprehensive immigration reform bill, told host Dana Bash that it was âincumbent upon the chairmanâ of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, to speak out publicly. Another Republican candidate, Carly Fiorina, appearing on ABC Newsâ âThis Week,â defended Mr. Trump, saying that his name doesnât often come up as she campaigns but that he âtaps into an anger that I hear every day. People are angry that a commonsense thing like securing the border or ending sanctuary cities is somehow considered extreme. It’s not extreme, it’s commonsense.â Speaker of the House John Boehner, the Ohio Republican, demurred on “Face the Nation” when asked whether Mr. Trump is hurting the party.  “I don’t know if he’s helping or hurting,” Mr. Boehner said. But he added, “Other candidates out there have much more responsible positions, in my view.”  He faulted President Obama for the current political environment in which passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill would be difficult. On the issue of a deal curtailing Iranâs nuclear capabilities, which Mr. Obama is seeking as a signature foreign policy achievement in his second term,  Mitch McConnell, Mr. Boehner’s Senate counterpart, said such an agreement will be âa very hard sell, if itâs completed, in Congress.â Speaking on âFox News Sunday,â Mr. McConnell said the administration would have done better to âratchet up sanctions even farther because thatâs what broughtâ Iran to the negotiating table to begin with. Appearing on the show after Mr. McConnell, Jim Webb, the former Virginia senator and current Democratic presidential hopeful, demonstrated again why he is such an unusual fit in his party, as he joined in the criticism of an Iran deal and of Democrats for moving too far to the left. On CBS Newsâ  âFace the Nation,â the presidential candidate who is seen by many  as most embodying that liberal shift, Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, refused to criticize the Democratic leader in the polls, Hillary Rodham Clinton. âI like Hillary Clinton and I respect Hillary Clinton and Iâm not going to engage in personal attacks against Hillary Clinton,â Mr. Sanders said. But he added that on âissue after issueâ there are âvery significant differences of opinion.â And as Mr. Walker, the Republican governor of Wisconsin, prepares to announce his presidential campaign on Monday, his two sons â who support gay marriage while he opposes it – appeared with Ms. Bash. When the they complained to their mother about their fatherâs remarks criticizing the Supreme Court ruling that gay marriage is constitutional, their mother sent them to talk to Mr. Walker. But they told Ms. Bash they stopped short of trying to change his views. âWe talked to him.  He just explained his position and that was it,â said Matt Walker.  His brother, Alex, added, âMatt and I aren’t necessarily changing his stances on any issues.”
