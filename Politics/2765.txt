Wisconsin is upon us.  The twin primaries in the state have the potential to further muddle the Democratic and Republican presidential races. For Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a win would further fuel his desire to keep the race going, particularly after he outraised Hillary Clinton by roughly $15 million in March.  For Donald J. Trump, a loss to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas seems likely, but there are degrees of defeat. He could score wins in some congressional districts, and fend off a bad storyline about getting trounced in the state pivotal to those trying to stop him. And Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio has done his best to stay in the fight. The contests on both sides have become increasingly nasty. On Wednesday, the focus for both races will move to New York, the home state of Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, the birth state of Mr. Sanders, and where the Democrats have agreed to a debate on April 14.  For Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, who have seemed weary at times, the break from long flights might be welcome. Mr. Cruz will most likely take a victory in Wisconsin and use it to press the case to on-the-fence donors that it is time to support him. Mrs. Clinton, should she win, would use the victory to again highlight Mr. Sandersâs difficult mathematical climb, a case that is harder for her to make when he wins.
