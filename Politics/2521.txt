Jeb Bush has plucked a top fund-raiser from the remains of Scott Walkerâs failed presidential campaign: Anthony Scaramucci, a New York investor who had served as Mr. Walkerâs national finance co-chairman. Mr. Scaramucci has signed on as Mr. Bush seeks to demonstrate to donors and others that his campaign is not flagging, despite sluggish poll numbers.  Mr. Bush’s allies are particularly sensitive to any perception that he is losing the battle for Walker staff members and leading forces in campaign finance to Marco Rubio, the Florida senator who has seen his standing in polls rise since a strong performance in the last debate. Mr. Bush, the former governor of Florida, said that Mr. Scaramucci, who was a member of Mitt Romneyâs New York finance team in 2012, would be âa valuable asset in sharing our campaign message of expanding economic opportunity for all Americans to voters across the nation.â Mr. Scaramucci, in a statement provided by the campaign, said Mr. Bush had âthe forward-looking vision and executive experience to lead our country and ensure our economy grows at its full potential.â He will be a member of the campaign’s national finance committee. Mr. Scaramucci, who hosts the “Wall Street Week” program on Fox stations on Sunday mornings, which is produced by his SkyBridge hedge fund. He has found himself in high demand since Mr. Walker, the Wisconsin governor, left the race, telling CNN last week that he had been contacted by three presidential campaigns by the afternoon that rumors of Mr. Walkerâs exit began to swirl.
