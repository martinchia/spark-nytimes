John Kasich, the Ohio governor and Republican presidential candidate, will hold a campaign fund-raiser in California next month, co-hosted by the businessman Ron Burkle, a onetime friend, donor and business partner of former President Bill Clinton. According to an invitation, Mr. Burkle is one of six co-hosts at the event on Jan. 12 at the SoHo House in West Hollywood, Calif.. Mr. Burkle owns the SoHo House chain. The event was first reported by Politico. Mr. Clinton had a partnership in Mr. Burkle’s Yucaipa holdings that he ended in 2008, when Hillary Clinton first ran for president. Mr. Burkle is also a staple of gossip pages, where he has made headlines for dating models and for his frequent travels. It was not immediately clear what Mr. Burkle’s connection is to Mr. Kasich that led to his involvement with the fund-raiser.
