Chris Hughes, the publisher of The New Republic, and his husband, Sean Eldridge, will hold a fund-raiser for Hillary Rodham Clinton’s presidential campaign, two people briefed on the invitation said.  The event will be held on June 30 at the couple’s Lower Manhattan home, the people said. Mr. Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, and Mr. Eldridge have sought in the last few years to become political players. Mr. Eldridge lost a race for Congress in upstate New York last year in which Mrs. Clinton recorded automated phone calls supporting him, despite the fact that polls showed him trailing badly before Election Day.  More noteworthy is Mr. Hughes’s ownership of The New Republic, a left-leaning journal of opinion that he has sought to turn into more of a digital-oriented company. The magazine has written  positively and skeptically of Mrs. Clinton, who is trying to woo progressives in her second presidential campaign.  Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, was a featured speaker at a 100th anniversary event for the magazine last year.
