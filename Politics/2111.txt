Ted Cruz is on a six-day, 28-town swing through Iowa. These are the places, faces and culinary selections of 2016âs first proper bus tour. EVENT 4 Time: 6:42 p.m., Jan. 4. Place: Winterset, Iowa (population: 5,190) Site: Winterset Stage, a local theater with impeccable acoustics and an open mike night on Jan. 30 (top prize: $50) Mood: spirited high school assembly Music: Banjo, violin and guitar ensemble to warm up the crowd before Mr. Cruz began. One act included a Cruz-focused anthem whose chorus is the name of his book, âA Time for Truth.â Lyrics: âIâm swayed by every policy / Knowing what he believes / Itâs standing strong for this country / Itâs a tiii-iiime for truth.â Cultural references: Renee Zellwegerâs character from Jerry Maguire (âYou had me at helloâ) and John F. Kennedy (âI intend to have in the office of president what J.F.K. used to refer to as âvigaaaahhhâ in defending the Constitution.” ) Highlight: As Mr. Cruz lamented the spending habits of the federal government, something dripped upon the stage from on high. âThe budget is so bad that the pipes are leaking,â he said dryly.
