Donald J. Trump’s immigration plan has been panned by many Democrats as an extreme measure, but some of his Republican rivals also have their doubts. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey said on Monday that walling off the entire southern border “doesn’t make any sense” and that it’s preposterous to promise voters that Mexico would pay for such a construction project. “This is not negotiation of a real estate deal, O.K.,” Mr. Christie told CNN. “This is international diplomacy and itâs different.” As for what he would do, Mr. Christie said that more patrol agents with better training are needed to secure the border. He also suggested the use of drones and an e-verify system to allow the government to determine the employment eligibility of workers. Mr. Christie’s criticism comes as he continues to languish in polls and faces the risk of being bumped to the lower tier in the second round of Republican presidential debates on Sept. 16. He and Senator Rand Paul have been especially aggressive with Mr. Trump as the billionaire businessman continues to surge in national and state polls.  Not all of Mr. Trump’s rivals have dismissed his immigration plan. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who now trails Mr. Trump in Iowa according to some surveys, appeared to embrace Mr. Trump’s proposal on Monday, telling Fox News that it was similar to what he proposed a few months ago.
