Alan Grayson, the newly minted Senate candidate from Florida, is confident, as was evident in how he began a telephone interview. âHi, this is Senator-elect Alan Grayson,â he said with a laugh in an interview on Thursday with First Draft. Indeed, as Mr. Grayson, the outspoken congressman from Floridaâs Ninth District, officially announced his entry into the Senate race on Thursday to replace Senator Marco Rubio, he did so with his trademark outspokenness, laying out a broad liberal platform while weaving in attacks at his opponents and doubters. His entry creates a headache for national Democrats and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which had been hoping for a strife-free primary in a state they view as a potential pickup in a presidential year.  But Mr. Grayson’s entry makes that unlikely, and he had his own choice words for the committee.  âFrankly, the D.S.C.C. is in no position to opine on this race, given that they have such a miserable record,â he said. âIt seems like the D.S.C.C. support is the kiss of death.”  And Mr. Grayson was equally dismissive of Representative Patrick Murphy, who has the backing of many national Democrats and was viewed as an early favorite to give the Democrats their best chance at winning back a Republican Senate seat. âWhatever it is that heâs selling, Democrats in Florida are not buying it,â Mr. Grayson said, adding that Mr. Murphy âpurported to become a Democrat when he decided to run for Congress. More often than not, heâs voted with Republicans.â Mr. Murphy welcomed Mr. Grayson to the race with a statement saying, âI look forward to a clean, honest discussion of the issues in this primary.â But given Mr. Graysonâs tendency to often speak bluntly and draw headlines â like saying Rush Limbaugh was âactually more lucid when he was a drug addict,â and calling the Tea Party âthe home of bigotry and discrimination in America todayâ while comparing it to the Ku Klux Klan â that is, well, unlikely. Mr. Grayson’s early platform falls in line with that of many national leading liberals, with his calls for expanding Medicare, lowering student loan interest rates, raising the minimum wage and expanding paid vacation and paid sick leave. And itâs this platform that he believes will endear him to the disparate voting blocks in Florida and set him apart from Mr. Murphy âThis is why Grayson voters will crawl naked over hot coals to vote for me,â Mr. Grayson said of his own support. Democrats believe that with next year’s presidential election pumping up turnout, they are well positioned to capture Mr. Rubioâs seat. And some Democrats are welcoming the fight. As Susan Smith, the president of the Democratic Progressive Caucus of Florida, wrote in a letter to Mr. Murphy in April, âWe donât want a war, we just want a primary.â With the entry of Mr. Grayson, they will get that primary.
