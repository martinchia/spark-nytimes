Three Republican presidential hopefuls struck back at Hillary Rodham Clinton on Friday after she accused them of trying to curtail voting rights. In a speech Thursday, Mrs. Clinton said that some in the Republican field were âdeliberately trying to stopâ young people and minorities from exercising their right to vote. On Friday, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey seemed to relish the fight. âSecretary Clinton doesn’t know the first thing about voting rights in New Jersey or in the other states that she attacked,â Mr. Christie said, according to The Record newspaper of New Jersey. âMy sense is that she just wants an opportunity to commit greater acts of voter fraud around the country.â Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin said in a statement: “Hillary Clinton’s rejection of efforts to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat not only defies logic, but the will of the majority of Americans. Once again, Hillary Clinton’s extreme views are far outside the mainstream.” His response represented one of the few times that any of the many Republican candidates in the 2016 field have described Mrs. Clinton’s views as so far left as to be outside mainstream politics. For Mrs. Clinton it is familiar territory: “Liberal” was a tag that was often affixed to her as a criticism in the 1990s and when she ran for the United States Senate from New York in 2000. Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who was also named by Mrs. Clinton, went on Fox News and suggested that being able to vote was no different than needing travel documents. âShe just went into my home state and dissed every person who supports having an identification to either get on an airplane or vote,â Mr. Perry said on Friday. A spokesman for Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, did not respond to an email request for comment. Mrs. Clinton’s no-holds-barred speech on voting rights, calling for automatic registration and sweeping changes to early voting nationally, was a rare time she has invoked her potential rivals, especially by name. But, just as when she said she would go even further than President Obama has on executive changes to the immigration system, Mrs. Clinton could be putting Republicans in a politically delicate position, since their responses on both issues are unlikely to please Hispanic, African-American and younger voters.
