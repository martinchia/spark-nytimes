Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has kicked off his presidential campaign with some harsh words for Senator Rand Paul, his Republican rival for the nomination. Taking issue with Mr. Paul’s views on the Patriot Act, privacy and government surveillance, Mr. Christie said that the senator from Kentucky has made the United States weaker and more vulnerable to terrorist attacks.  “We’re going to look back on this and he should be in front of hearings, in front of Congress, if there’s another attack,” Mr. Christie said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” Mr. Christie has accused Mr. Paul of politicizing national security, saying that as a former state prosecutor he knows firsthand about using the Patriot Act.  “I’m combat ready,” Mr. Christie said. As for his waning popularity in his home state, Mr. Christie said that his sagging poll numbers in New Jersey were because of continuing media criticism over the George Washington Bridge traffic-disruption scandal and the fact that he is running for president.  “Each one of the governors are running, the numbers are down in their states,” Mr. Christie said, suggesting that his constituents were sad that he was moving on. “That’s the way it goes.”
