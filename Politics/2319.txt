BOCA RATON, Fla. â Trump University may be closed and embroiled in controversy, but Donald J. Trump offered his fans a free lesson in branding Sunday evening at an outdoor rally here. As he began to talk about two of his remaining Republican rivals â Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida â Mr. Trump quickly transitioned to his favored nicknames for the two men. âLyinâ Ted,â he said, before spelling it out, letter by letter, for the crowd: âL-Y-I-N-apostrophe.â âWe canât say it the right way,â he explained. âWe’ve got to go â Lyinâ! Lyinâ Ted!â Turning his attention to Mr. Rubio, whom he calls âLittle Marco,â Mr. Trump spelled out his preferred nickname: âL-I-D-D-L-E. Liddle, Liddle, Liddle Marco.â âYou know, you have to brand people a certain way when theyâre your opponents,â Mr. Trump said, before relishing in perhaps his most devastating description of this election cycle â calling Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, âlow energy.â âLike Jeb Bush â we call him low energy, low energy,â he continued. âAnd I donât care talking badly about him. He spent $29 million in negatives on me, $29 million. Can you believe it? Of other peopleâs money. Of his lobbyist and his special interest money.â Finally, Mr. Trump concluded his education interlude. âBut youâve got to brand people,â he said, going on the describe the original Republican field. âSo we started off with 17 people who were up on this stage, and what the hell did I know about this stuff? Iâve never done this before, right? So we start off with 17 people, now weâre down to four. Bush was favored, then Walker was favored, then another one was favored, theyâre all favored.â âNow,â he finished with a flourish, as the crowd roared, âTrump is favored.â
