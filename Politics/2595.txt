Good Tuesday morning from Washington, where, a day after returning from Group of 7 meetings in Germany, President Obama will move his attention to defending his health care law, and where a senator clears time for blueberry muffins. And Jeb Bush begins his own Europe trip as he switches some job titles on his team. As Mr. Bush arrives in Germany on Tuesday, he hopes to focus on global affairs and to project confidence. But he is certain to face questions about a shake-up in his campaign structure, a version of musical chairs that placed staff members in different roles and came after a period of extended tumult. Mr. Bush, who is expected to formally announce his candidacy on June 15, elevated the veteran operative Danny Diaz to campaign manager. The person who had been expected to fill that role, the Iowa operative David Kochel, will be the campaignâs chief strategist, focusing on building political operations in early voting states. Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist with long ties to the Bush world, will be on the campaign, but not as the national political director, as was expected. The changes were necessary for a Bush team that had become stultified by tensions and a lack of clear lines of authority. The staff roster quickly became bloated. Mr. Bush’s aides say they hope that things will run more smoothly after the changes that have been put in place. That is almost certainly also the desire of Mr. Bush, who has been stalled in polling in early states and who has sustained several self-inflicted wounds. Mr. Bush is known to keep his own counsel, often listening to aides before going a different way â as was the case when he enthusiastically backed an Indiana religious rights bill after his advisers suggested a different course, according to four people briefed on the issue. Several Republicans have compared Mr. Bush’s situation to that of Senator John McCain of Arizona in 2007, who went on to win the nomination. That campaign underwent a shake-up around this time that year, and endured similar culture clashes between newer aides and those who had Mr. McCain’s ear for years. But the dynamics are somewhat different: Mr. McCain came into the race a media darling and a war hero with a compelling story.

Mr. Obama will attend the Catholic Hospital Association Conference in Washington to continue making a push for health care in the weeks leading to the Supreme Court’s decision on the Affordable Care Act. It is a busy week for Republicans, and on Tuesday, Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey will be in New Hampshire, while Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, has several stops in Iowa. And the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee will hold hearings on the Transportation Security Administration, whose acting director was recently reassigned after screeners found severe flaws in the airport checkpoint system. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky continues to campaign where other candidates arenât. He travels to Maryland on Tuesday night to deliver the keynote address at the Baltimore County Republican dinner, his first trip to Baltimore since his comments on the riots there caused a bit of a stir. The visit follows a common path by Mr. Paul: appearing at traditional Republican events like Lincoln Day dinners, but in untraditional locations. Mr. Paul, who skipped last weekendâs hog-and-ride event in Iowa featuring seven Republican candidates, recently traveled to the dark-blue state of Illinois, which hasnât voted for a Republican for president since George Bush in 1988. He spoke at the DuPage County Lincoln Day Dinner and held a âStand With Randâ rally in Chicago. His speech focused on criminal justice overhaul in an appeal to African-Americans, who have traditionally favored Democrats in the city. It was all part of his plan to build a âbroad coalitionâ for his candidacy, and it continues this weekend when he heads to California, which also hasnât voted for a Republican for president since 1988, to speak at the Republican Party of San Diegoâs Lincoln Day Dinner. — Nick Corasaniti In 2008, the Supreme Court said for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to own guns. The ruling has so far been largely symbolic; it has been firing mostly blanks. Lower courts have been ruling against Second Amendment challenges to all kinds of gun control laws, and the Supreme Court has been letting them. It happened again on Monday, when the court turned down a case over the sharp protests of Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia. âDespite the clarity with which we described the Second Amendmentâs core protection for the right of self-defense, lower courts, including the ones here, have failed to protect it,â Justice Thomas wrote. Mondayâs case concerned a San Francisco ordinance that requires handguns kept in homes to be stored in locked boxes or disabled with a trigger lock when they are not being carried. The lead plaintiff, Espanola Jackson, a woman in her 80s, said the lawâs requirements made it impossible for her to defend herself. âIf I heard an intruder break into my home in the middle of the night,â she said in a sworn statement, âI would have to turn on the light, find my glasses, find the key to the lockbox, insert the key in the lock and unlock the box (under the stress of the emergency), and then get my gun before being in position to defend myself. That is not an easy task at my age.â Such a delay, Justice Thomas wrote on Monday, âcould easily be the difference between life and death.â The majority, as is the court’s custom when it turns down a case, gave no reasons. — Adam Liptak Many of the financial troubles experienced by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida have played out in an unusually public way, leading even some of his supporters to worry. Amid discussions on security issues, Mr. Obama headed home from the Group of 7 meetings with pledges from European leaders to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases. And a new survey offers a snapshot of where Republicans and Democrats stand on same-sex marriage, an issue that will most likely be injected into the 2016 presidential race as soon as the Supreme Court makes its ruling this month. Mr. McCain is using his post as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee to try to control military expenses while enabling his priorities like increasing aid to Ukraine. Reports that Mr. Obama said there was no complete strategy to defeat the Islamic State were themselves incomplete, Vox says. He went on at length, the publication adds, saying that “there’s no full strategy yet for training and equipping Iraqi soldiers because ‘it requires commitments on the part of the Iraqis.’ ” That, Vox says, is “different than saying he has no strategy for ISIS.” Gov. Scott Walker’s budget priorities are taking a hit back in Wisconsin as lawmakers restore spending while Mr. Walker has been elsewhere on the campaign trail, Politico reports. Fresh off that motorcycles and roasted pork event on Saturday, which she hosted, Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa told CNN that Hillary Rodham Clinton was falling short on women’s issues. Reuters takes a look at “New Hampshire’s love affair” with candidates named Clinton and Bush. More than a dozen veterans of Gary Hart‘s 1984 presidential bid have latched on to another long-shot run: that of former Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, The Washington Post reports. Senator Susan Collins can talk about cybersecurity with great authority. Same with the U.S.A. Patriot Act, federal restrictions on restaurant renovations and all manner of issues related to older Americans, as she is chairwoman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. But she really loves to discuss blueberry muffins. Ms. Collins, a Republican from Maine and an accomplished home cook, has been perfecting the breakfast treat for her husband, the political consultant Thomas Daffron. She bakes on Sunday nights and sends Mr. Daffron off to work with a warmed-up muffin each morning, before zipping off to a different sort of hot kitchen on Capitol Hill. Ms. Collins, whose love of food is put to use as the overseer of a Thursday Senate Republican lunch club, comes by her passion honestly. Her mother, Patricia Collins, the onetime mayor of Caribou, Maine, and the mother of six, published two cookbooks. Ms. Collins learned by example as her motherâs cooking became more sophisticated along with the rest of the nationâs over the last century. âShe would take notes while watching Julia Child on television,â Ms. Collins said. With her work in the Senate, Ms. Collins has limited time to cook, but keeping track of the senator meals on Thursday keeps her well versed in regional food traditions. As for the muffins, âI am trying things with cranberries,â Ms. Collins said. — Jennifer Steinhauer Like the Politics Newsletter? Get it delivered to your inbox.
