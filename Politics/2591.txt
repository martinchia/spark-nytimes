Hillary Rodham Clinton’s top campaign lawyer has filed a second voter-access lawsuit accusing a Republican-led state of trying to suppress the vote — this time in Wisconsin, home to Scott Walker, the governor and likely Republican 2016 presidential candidate.  Marc Elias, the general counsel for the Clinton campaign and an election law expert, filed the suit in federal court on Friday. It was reported in the blog of Rick Hasen, an election law expert who works at the University of California, Irvine.  “This lawsuit concerns the most fundamental of rights guaranteed citizens in our representative democracy â the right to vote,” the complaint states, then refers to a curtailing of early voting in the state, among other changes that affect minority voters and other groups. “That right has been under attack in Wisconsin since Republicans gained control of the governorâs office and both houses of the State Legislature in the 2010 election.” Mrs. Clinton’s aides said the suit was not filed on behalf of the campaign, but they offered their support for it.  âWe are aware of it and strongly support its goal of ensuring the right to vote is not unduly burdened,â Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said in a statement.  Mr. Elias filed a similar lawsuit in Ohio recently, accusing the state of trying to suppress the votes of traditional Democratic constituencies like blacks, Hispanics and young people.  Mr. Walker, as he travels around the country, often talks about his efforts to push through changes in the voting rights laws to require people to bring identification to the polls.
