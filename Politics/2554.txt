A top donor to Hillary Rodham Clinton expressed his opposition Thursday to the Obama administration’s agreement with Iran to curtail its nuclear program, calling it a “very bad deal.” The deal has posed a test for Mrs. Clinton as she balances general support for Mr. Obama’s foreign policy with the opposition the Iran deal has drawn from some leading Jewish donors and politicians. The negotiations began while she was still the secretary of state under Mr. Obama, and she has spoken with skepticism about Iran living up to an agreement. However, in a recent meeting with House Democrats she embraced the deal, while calling it “not perfect.” The donor, Haim Saban, told Channel 1 in Israel that we “need to fight” the deal. Mr. Saban is a Hollywood mogul who is behind the Power Rangers fortune, and he owns a majority stake in Univision. He has donated $2 million to the “super PAC” supporting Mrs. Clinton.
